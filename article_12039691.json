        "The DWP said that 99% of households initially eligible through the department will have been directly paid \u00a3301 by the Government by the end of Wednesday.The \u201csmall number\u201d of payments outstanding will continue to be made automatically up to May 17, the department added.After this date, if someone thinks they may be missing a payment they are entitled to a form can be filled out on the gov.uk website to make a claim.",
        "Meanwhile, one million eligible households receiving tax credits, and no other means-tested benefits, will receive their \u00a3301 cost-of-living payments from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) up until May 9. Again, these payments should be automatic, with no need to apply for them.People should also watch out for any scammers sending fake messages about cost-of-living payments. In general, people should pause to think before handing over any money or personal details if they have received unexpected contact."
