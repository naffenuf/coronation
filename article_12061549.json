        "Prior to the World Cup kicking off in Qatar last November, 16 Socceroos players made a collective statement of protest against the host nation over its treatment of migrant workers and the LGBTQI community.They included the likes of skipper Mat Ryan, midfielders Jackson Irvine, Mat Leckie and Craig Goodwin, striker Mitch Duke, defender Kye Rowles and cult hero goalkeeper Andrew Redmayne.\u00a0'There are universal values that should define football values such as respect, dignity, trust, and courage. When we represent our nation, we aspire to embody these values,' the players said at the time.'Basic rights should be afforded to all and will ensure continued progress in Qatar.'This is how we can ensure a legacy that goes well beyond the final whistle of the 2022 FIFA World Cup.'",

        "The New York Times revealed the starting price for the appearance fee is thought to be in the region of $5million (AUD$7.4million).Argentina will play two friendlies in June in the international window between June 12 and June 20 - and it\u00a0is understood the first game will be played in Beijing, with the second in Indonesia.Ahead of a potential friendly against Argentina, Australia will turn its focus on the draw for the 2023 Asian Cup, which takes place on Thursday in Doha.Qatar will host the tournament in January, with the Socceroos last winning the silverware in 2015."
