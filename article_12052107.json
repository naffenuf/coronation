        "Speaking to the camera, she said: 'I\u2019m just packing so I thought I\u2019d try this on to show... This is the black swimming costume and I got a size 14, so I think it\u2019s the right size for me.'It\u2019s a bit booby so it\u2019s still a little bit sexy. I like it.'She added: 'It's actually stretchier than the bikini so I think if you're in between sizes you can\u00a0 go for your normal size rather than sizing up.'It comes after Amy was praised last month for her candid approach to post-baby dressing after sharing an outfit try-on Instagram post.\u00a0The reality star took to Instagram in April to share an insight into her postpartum wardrobe choices - with incredible candour about less flattering options.\u00a0",

Love number 2 on you... You look amazing Amy! I love that you included the 3rd one. We all have those moments! The second dress is so lovely x...\u00a0",

Thank you for repping for reality!! Xx... You look lovely on all of them. Even number 3 xxxxxxx... The green dress looked Fab!'Another ensemble in the try on was a stunning green vest dress which clung to her frame in a stunning fashion.\u00a0She also went for summery options in a flirty blue mini dress and a linen sundress.\u00a0",
