        "The 44-year-old - who is currently expecting her first child this summer with husband Keven Undergaro -\u00a0told People magazine on Wednesday that she had battled stage 2 pancreatic cancer after being diagnosed in January.Menounos has stated that she underwent a successful surgery to remove a 3.9-centimeter tumor and is now hoping that sharing her story will encourage others to seek answers for their health problems.\u00a0'I need people to know there are places they can go to catch things early,' she told the publication.\u00a0Her latest health battle follows her heartbreaking ordeal in 2017, when she had golf-ball sized brain tumor removed, at the same time that she was caring for her mother who was battling stage 4 brain cancer.\u00a0Her mother passed away in 2021.\u00a0\u00a0Last June, Menounos was also diagnosed with type 1 diabetes - which runs in her family.Speaking about her cancer battle, she added: 'You can't let fear get in the way. I had that moment where I thought I was a goner \u2014but I'm okay because I caught this early enough.'",
        "Earlier this year she and her 55-year-old TV writer husband revealed they were expecting a child via surrogate.She said: 'This whole year has been trauma, stress, crisis.'There was a minute when we were planning something, and then it became too much. I thought, \"I just need to heal.\"'",
        "After suffering severe leg cramps last year, Menounos was\u00a0diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, but as the pain continued she agreed to do\u00a0whole-body MRI scan.\u00a0The results of the scan revealed a 3.9 cm. mass on her pancreas. A later biopsy identified it as a Stage 2 pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor - which is a form of cancer.Menounos said: 'I'm like \"How in the freaking world can I have a brain tumor and pancreatic cancer?\u00a0All I could think was that I have a baby coming.'However, she had caught the cancer at an early stage, and underwent surgery to have it removed on February 16. She does not require chemotherapy or any treatment other than annual scans for the next five years.She said: 'I'm so grateful and so lucky.\u00a0God granted me a miracle. I'm going to appreciate having her in my life so much more than I would have before this journey.'",
        "Pancreatic cancer begins in the tissues of your pancreas \u2014 an organ in your abdomen that lies behind the lower part of your stomach. Your pancreas releases enzymes that aid digestion and produces hormones that help manage your blood sugar.Several types of growths can occur in the pancreas, including cancerous and noncancerous tumors. The most common type of cancer that forms in the pancreas begins in the cells that line the ducts that carry digestive enzymes out of the pancreas (pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma).Pancreatic cancer is seldom detected at its early stages when it's most curable. This is because it often doesn't cause symptoms until after it has spread to other organs.Pancreatic cancer treatment options are chosen based on the extent of the cancer. Options may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy or a combination of these.(via Mayo Clinic)\u00a0",
        "The podcast host has been open about her health battles in recent years as she had a brain tumor removed back in 2017 while caring for her mother Litsa who had Stage 4 brain cancer.She\u00a0was diagnosed with meningioma, which is a tumor of the meninges, which is the tissue that surrounding the brain and spinal cord.However, it is classified as a brain tumor because it puts pressure on cranial nerves. The tumor generally forms in the head and about 85 percent of cases are benign.Because the tumors are slow-growing, a patient can live with a meningioma for years before it's spotted.Meanwhile her mother Litsa had battled stage 4 brain cancer since 2016, specifically glioblastoma, but unfortunately passed away in May 2021.On Tuesday, Menounos paid tribute to her mother on the second anniversary of her death as she shared a sweet snap of the two of them with a lengthy caption which read: ''For standing up to Dad , the strict Greek father, when he said no to all of it. [laughing while crying emoji] For teaching me how to cook. How to be selfless and brave. For showing me how to face a brain tumor and smile all the way through.\u00a0'I thought the health journeys ended there but from the other side you have helped me in through more. I feel you and I hear you. And if I miss your voice speaking to me you speak to me through others. Loudly. I love you and miss you and am just so grateful I got you for a mom. I hope I can be 10% of what you were for my daughter. [red heart emoji]'",
        "Meanwhile, last week the couple announced on Maria's podcast, Heal Squad x Maria Menounos, that they are expecting a girl.\u00a0\u00a0'We're having a girl! We're very excited to announce we that we have a baby girl coming,' Maria gushed.\u00a0'Little Gertrude,' her husband joked.While Maria insisted they were not naming their daughter Gertrude, she\u00a0did reveal they already had a name selected.",
        "'We do have a name picked out,' she said. 'We've been thinking about names for years because as you may or may not know, this has been almost a 10 year journey for us, so we've thought about names forever, and I think we've come up with the perfect name.'However, the name is not set in stone.\u00a0\u00a0'I do reserve the right to seeing her and making any last minute decisions,' she added.The couple also had a display of pink balloons and a matching elephant she purchased for her daughter in the studio.Maria shared video of their announcement to her Instagram, captioning it:\u00a0'a girl!!!! We are over the moon excited! We are reading baby books, working on the nursery and just overall preparing for this beautiful new addition to our lives. She is already so loved and we cannot wait to meet her. And her name isn\u2019t Gertrude. Lol any guesses on her name? Any great suggestions?'",
        "Maria and her husband announced their baby news back in February, revealing they were expanding their\u00a0family with the help of a surrogate.\u00a0\u00a0They started IVF in 2012 but it did not take, so they turned to surrogacy several years ago, and after a hiccup, they feel confident they will be parents this year.'Just after a decade of trying everything, we are so grateful to the beautiful family helping us conceive our baby,' she told People in February. 'Keven, my dad and I are all beyond excited for this soul to come into our lives. What a blessing.'She also shared that her longtime friend Kim Kardashian - who welcomed two child via surrogate - helped her with understanding the process.\u00a0",
        "The couple started thinking about surrogacy in 2018 after IVF did not work for them.Maria then got advice from her Kardashian, who welcomed Chicago and Psalm via surrogates with her then husband Kayne West.Sister Khloe also used a surrogate to welcome a son with Tristan Thompson.\u00a0'I was grateful that I had her to share and help me,' Menounos said of Kim, 42. 'She was just so lovely and so amazing and very patient with us,' added the One Tree Hill star.After surrogacy did not work out in 2021, Maria and Keven tried again, and it has been successful, she said."
