        "It comes after Molly-Mae took to Instagram to showcase the stylish outfit she wore earlier in the week, including a \u00a39k Chanel bag and \u00a3700 Loewe shirt having previously set tongues wagging over 'flaunting her wealth'.Captioning her snap, she penned: 'Not everyday tracksuit. Much to my sadness.'\u00a0While Molly-Mae looked comfortable in her pricey ensemble, she recently divided her social media followers, who accused her of flaunting her wealth by posing in an airport terminal surrounded by her \u00a34,000 designer luggage.\u00a0Having just returned from a lavish family holiday in Dubai, the star cut a casual figure in a black T-shirt, matching leggings and an oversized blazer as she sat outside a Hermes boutique in a post shared on Sunday.\u00a0\u00a0She styled her long blonde tresses pulled back in a claw clip leaving strands to frame her face as she leaned on her hand.\u00a0",
