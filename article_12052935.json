So we have to be very careful.'Somebody that's going to run out in front of the carriage, fiddling with something in their rucksack, who's to say that's not an IED rather than a banner that's just going to be unfolded.'These demonstrators have to be very careful as to the environment that they're going into, the police are acutely aware of it.'On Friday the eco activists were blasted for causing cars to sit in a traffic jam with their engines running.\u00a0An angry van driver blasted\u00a0Just Stop Oil activists who disrupted rush hour traffic this morning with a slow march through north London.\u00a0",
