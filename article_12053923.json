        "Follow our live blog for all the latest updates on the King's Coronation\u00a0How are YOU celebrating the Coronation? Send your pictures and videos to pictures@mailonline.co.uk\u00a0Furious royal fans have slammed the\u00a0BBC for the 'terrible' audio quality in the broadcast of King Charles III's Coronation.\u00a0",
        "Viewers criticised the network on Twitter this morning as 'breaks in the sound feed' interrupted their viewing of the historic event.The outraged royalists complained that the network's sound failure was 'shocking' especially since BBC had 'months of preparation and years of anticipation' for the monumental event.One alleged that when asked what he remembers most from the event he would say 'BBC f*****g the sound up'. Others demanded an 'on-screen apology' from the broadcaster as they vowed to switch the channel to ITV and Sky.It comes as the UK's broadcasting big guns are going toe to toe in the ratings war over this weekend's royal coverage.",
        "The BBC positioned itself to be a leader in Coronation coverage ahead of this weekend's festivities.The broadcaster is airing the proceedings across its network, available to watch on BBC One and BBC iPlayer.It also offered a special one-off TV licence dispensation for the historic ceremony, meaning if\u00a0you are hosting an event, you won\u2019t need a TV licence to screen coverage of the Coronation today or the Coronation Concert tomorrow.\u00a0However, royalists allege the network dropped the ball by having poor sound quality in its broadcasts.'Come on\u00a0BBC. Sort the\u00a0sound out on your outside broadcasts. Keeps breaking up,' Twitter user Jane Trout penned, adding: 'Going over to ITV to watch the Coronation\u00a0without the hiccups.'",
        "'Bloody dreadful sound quality for the Coronation,' tweeted\u00a0Helen Parsons.Kelsey Harkness-Jones added: 'BBC you will ruin the\u00a0Coronation\u00a0if you don't sort the\u00a0sound!!!'",
        "Social media users called on the broadcaster to address the audio issues, with one mockingly saying: 'Hats off to whoever is the\u00a0#BBC\u00a0sound\u00a0engineer doing the audio mixing at the\u00a0#Coronation\u00a0ceremony. Top class work.'One viewer said it was 'quite frankly embarrassing' that the network that 'specialises in effective and smooth communication' had so many breaks in its sound.'Months to prepare, but the BBC\u00a0clearly have\u00a0sound\u00a0issues today of all days!' Twitter user Sherri wrote. 'Glad it's not my TV but disappointing that the\u00a0sound\u00a0has been cutting out so frequently...'Many viewers alleged that ITV and Sky were providing superior broadcast quality as they branded BBC's coverage as being 'really disappointing'.'Sound\u00a0constantly dropping out on the Coronation. This is what we pay our licence fee for?' one tweeted. 'Switched over to ITV.'Another added: 'Gave up on the BBC 1 coverage of the Coronation - horrendous sound issues. The UHD feed on iPlayer is much better - crystal clear visuals and the sound is in sync!'\u00a0",
        "The criticisms come amid backlash from\u00a0royal correspondent Jonny Dymond after the BBC branded Charles's Coronation 'the strangest show in town'.In his BBC article, Dymond references Australian singer-songwriter Nick Cave, who will attend today's event 'for the bizarre, the uncanny, the stupefying spectacular, the awe inspiring'.\u00a0",
        "Dymond then states that 'The Coronation will be all these things and more,' headlining his article 'the strangest show in town'.\u00a0One person wrote on Twitter: 'This seems a somewhat \"strange\" adjective to use by the #BBC Royal Correspondent.'Why pick on the Coronation?'\u00a0Another wrote: 'What a waste of our licence money. This reporter helpfully tells people areas to avoid in London and other\u00a0unnecessary advice as to how to avoid \u2018the strangest show in town'.'People who don\u2019t want to go, or even know about this historic day have already made their plans.'\u00a0",
        "Dymond also wrote: 'Every big royal occasion, jubilee or wedding, birth or death, is an opportunity of sorts.'A chance to remind the nation and the world of the institution's role and relevance. And a moment to reinvent and rebrand.'\u00a0He added: 'And this Coronation comes against a challenging backdrop.'\u00a0BBC presenter Huw Edwards was also criticised on Twitter for spending 'five minutes' talking about spoons.\u00a0",
