        "The police and intelligence agencies are mounting a \u201cvery complex\u201d security operation around the coronation \u2013 with the eyes of the world set to be on the UK.",
        "Security minister Tom Tugendhat said police are \u201call over it\u201d and not complacent about the scale of the challenge.New laws to curb protests came into force on Wednesday ahead of Saturday\u2019s ceremony but Mr Tugendhat said the celebrations will \u201cshowcase our liberty and our democracy\u201d.",
        "Under the new Public Order Act, protesters who block roads will face up to 12 months behind bars.An official letter warning of the new powers was sent to anti-monarchy campaign group Republic, which said its campaign around the coronation will proceed as planned.Republic boss Graham Smith said it is \u201cvery odd\u201d the letter came from the Home Office and described it as \u201cintimidatory\u201d.He told the PA news agency: \u201cWe\u2019ve been liaising closely with the police about the protest for weeks. We\u2019ve had meetings with them.\u201cThey\u2019ve said very clearly that they have no problems with our plans. I just can\u2019t understand why the Home Office thinks it\u2019s appropriate to send a letter like that, which was anonymous in terms of no person\u2019s name on it.\u201dMr Smith added: \u201cIt struck us as intimidatory in a way.\u201dHe said there are plans for 1,700 people to protest in Trafalgar Square on Saturday.Mr Tugendhat said the operation around the coronation will show \u201csecurity can be a liberator in a democracy, not like an authoritarian state where it\u2019s a controller\u201d.",
        "Asked about the letter sent to Republic, Mr Tugendhat said: \u201cThey have the liberty that anybody in the United Kingdom has to protest. What they don\u2019t have the liberty to do is to disrupt others.\u201cAnd that\u2019s where we\u2019re drawing and making a difference.\u201dPressed on whether the new laws will prevent protesters unfurling banners in certain locations or getting on to the route of the parade, Mr Tugendhat told the BBC\u2019s Today programme: \u201cI\u2019m not going to go through the details of what you can or can\u2019t do for fear of encouraging people to find loopholes in it, for very obvious reason.\u201dHe said the presence of foreign leaders at the coronation adds to the complexity of the operation.\u201cIt\u2019s perfectly possible that we\u2019re dealing with protest groups who have nothing to do with the UK but are seeking to protest against a foreign leader who\u2019s visiting or seeking to make a complaint about something that\u2019s happening hundreds or thousands of miles away.\u201cSo this is a very complex policing operation, a very complex intelligence operation.\u201d",
        "The arrest of a man after suspected shotgun cartridges were thrown into the grounds of Buckingham Palace on Tuesday evening was a sign of the effectiveness of the security operation, Mr Tugendhat said.\u201cThe police are, to put it mildly, all over it and our intelligence and other security forces are extremely aware of the challenges that we face and ready to deal with them \u2013 as the police did quite brilliantly yesterday,\u201d he told Times Radio.",
        "He said the coronation is \u201can opportunity to showcase the United Kingdom to the world\u201d.\u201cSo we\u2019re very conscious that there are going to be quite literally thousands \u2013 possibly hundreds of thousands \u2013 of foreign tourists, there are going to be many film crews and journalists from around the world and, of course, we\u2019re going to have heads of state and government coming to celebrate with us on Saturday.\u201cSo this is an enormously important moment for the country.\u201dIn response to a suggestion the operation will cost taxpayers at least \u00a3100 million, the security minister told Sky News: \u201cIt\u2019s not a figure I recognise.\u201dHe said: \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to pull that out as a separate figure for the simple reason that we have got an enormous amount of effort going in for a major incident like this in different parts of the country \u2013 because there are people getting together in streets, there\u2019s people getting together in gatherings across the country because this is a moment of national celebration.\u201cWhat I think is worth looking at, though, is how much this is bringing to the country in terms of the number of tourists who are coming, the amount of attention that is coming and, indeed, I hope, the amount of business that will be generated by heads of state and government and other business people coming to the UK at this time to see what we offer.\u201d"
