        "Next to the blue whale, the fin whale is the second largest mammal in the world.\u00a0They can grow as large as 80 ft long\u00a0weigh up to 120 tons.They have a distinct ridge along their back behind the dorsal fin, which gives it the nickname 'razorback.'\u00a0Fin whales have a very unusual feature: the lower right jaw is bright white and the lower left jaw is black.\u00a0Commercial whaling saw nearly 750,000 animals killed the Southern Hemisphere between 1904 and 1979.Their current status is unknown in most areas outside of the North Atlantic.Commercial whaling remains a threat for fin whales. After a two-year hiatus, Iceland resumed commercial fin whaling in 2013 with a quota of 184 whales. The majority of the whale meat ends up in Japanese markets.Source: WWF\u00a0"
