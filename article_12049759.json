It went on for so long I ended up leaving LA,' Browning began, referencing the 2007-2008 WGA strike that lasted 100 days.",

I have been a proud SAG-AFTRA member for two decades, and I stand in solidarity with the WGA,' she added.\u00a0'Money may be what moves this town, but art makes it. You can\u2019t make or move anything without writers,' she added.\u00a0'Writers deserve to have their value honored in every way. STARTING WITH LIVING WAGES,' Browning continued.\u00a0'Every industry can relate to the changing world impacting their careers. We have to stick together as humans who give a s**t about each other. Don\u2019t become a robot,' she concluded with the hashtags #AIdidnotwritethis #WGAstrong #UnionStrong #SAGAFTRAsupportsWGA.Her 'robot' comments reflect one of the major sticking points the writers guild are fighting against, the regulation of A.I.-generated content used for films and TV.",
