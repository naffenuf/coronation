        "Harry Garside could be banned from Aussie Olympic teamBoxer is accused of assaulting against his ex-girlfriend\u00a0If convicted Garside would be in breach of AOC rulesBoxer and reality TV star Harry Garside could be barred from joining Australia's team for next year's Paris Olympics after allegedly assaulting his ex-girlfriend Ash Ruscoe.",
        "Garside, 25, was arrested at Sydney International Airport on Tuesday as he returned to Australia from filming the reality TV series I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here.The Olympic bronze medallist is accused of committing domestic assault against his ex-girlfriend, Ash Ruscoe, at a property in Bondi on March 1.Garside\u00a0won the bronze medal for Australia at the Toyko 2020 Olympics and intends to compete at the Paris 2024 Olympics - which could leave the AOC with a very difficult decision.A squad has not been yet named for the 2024 Games in Paris, but Garside - who was the first Aussie to win an Olympic boxing medal in 33 years - would appear to be a shoo-in for selection.",
        "However, if charges are upheld against talented boxer he would breach the AOC's Team Membership Agreement, which has stringent behavioural conditions.One such condition states athletes shouldn't 'at any time engage in conduct (whether publicly known or not and whether before or after the date of my selection), which has brought, brings or would have the tendency to bring me or my sport into disrepute or censure.'Another condition demands team members can't 'be convicted of, or charged with, any serious offence involving violence, alcohol or drugs, or any sex offence'.",
        "A spokesman for the AOC told News Corp: 'Given the matter is before the courts, it's not appropriate for the AOC to comment beyond observing that Harry Garside has not yet qualified for the Paris 2024 Olympic Games \u2013 nor is he yet nominated or selected.'In 2008, swimmer Nick D'Arcy breached these rules by assaulting Simon Cowley in a Sydney bar and was dumped from the 2008 Beijing Olympic team.Garside posted a statement to his Instagram page on Wednesday, saying he intended to fight the charge.\u00a0'The conduct of police in the presence of the media at Sydney International Airport yesterday took me completely by surprise,' Garside told AAP in a statement.'I categorically deny the allegations of violence and dispute the account given to police.",
        "'I have nothing to hide and will defend myself against this charge.'The police have not been provided with all of the facts and I am confident that my reputation will be vindicated through the legal process.'Because the matter is before the courts, I won't be saying anything further.'"
