        "Newport manager Graham Coughlan admitted the frantic finale at Rodney Parade summed up his side\u2019s season as they threw away two points to draw 2-2 with Crewe.",
        "Striker Omar Bogle thought he had bundled in the winner in the first minute of time added on after cancelling out Rio Adebisi\u2019s stunning opener with a penalty 13 minutes from time.But County were caught napping at the other end in the 93rd minute and allowed Lachlan Brook to earn Crewe a deserved share of the spoils.\u201cOmar has been very good for us. He should have been on a winning team today,\u201d said Coughlan, who replaced James Rowberry in October with the Exiles only two points above the relegation zone.\u201cDefensively, we conceded two sloppy goals. It was a real disappointment, the manner in which we conceded the goals. But that\u2019s been there all season.\u201cWe weren\u2019t great, we looked a little bit flat, and it was a typical end-of-season performance.",
        "\u201cThe same mistakes are happening too often, so that needs sorting out. Today summed up our season \u2013 moments of madness, moments of brilliance, sloppiness.\u201cSince we\u2019ve come in, we\u2019ve done brilliant to climb the table and put that amount of points on the board. I think we\u2019ve done exceptionally well to dig ourselves out of a bit of a mess that we found ourselves in.\u201dCoughlan\u2019s men end the season in 15th place on 57 points \u2013 14 clear of the bottom two and with plenty to build on for next season.",
        "\u201cI know what needs fixing and it\u2019s my job to get that done over the summer,\u201d he said.\u201cI\u2019m hopeful of getting one or two (players) in, and one or two will leave, but I don\u2019t expect wholesale changes.\u201dCrewe finish one point and two places better off than their final-day hosts and boss Lee Bell is also encouraged as he looks ahead to August.\u201cIt was a good end-of-season game. I thought we were unlucky \u2013 we could have scored another couple,\u201d said Bell, who took over from Alex Morris in November.\u201cBut it was a good response from a good bunch of players with good character.\u201cThat\u2019s what they\u2019ve done a lot since I\u2019ve been in charge, and were unlucky not to get three points to take us up another couple of places.\u201cWe were able to get some younger players onto the pitch, which we\u2019ve done a lot in the past few weeks, and that will give them more experience for next season.\u201cThere\u2019s plenty to build on, particularly in the last six weeks. We\u2019re optimistic for next year, but we know we\u2019ve got to work hard to get the right players in.\u201d"
