        "Jurgen Klopp insists Liverpool will improve after enduring a 'crisis' this seasonThe Reds have turned around poor form to go on a seven-match unbeaten runThe German manager accepts that he has made 'mistakes' with his line-ups\u00a0\u00a0Jurgen Klopp believes Liverpool can be better for riding through the 'crisis' that has bogged down his team's 2022-23 campaign.\u00a0",
        "The Reds have experienced a 'difficult season' by the manager's own admission, struggling to find form in the Premier League since the opening day in August, and eliminated early from all three cup competitions despite making the finals in 2022.\u00a0But Klopp's side may have now turned a corner, with a seven-game unbeaten run going into Saturday evening's meeting with Brentford.\u00a0The German said that Liverpool's struggles over recent months could actually aid the club in the long run - and admits that his job would have been in serious jeopardy at other clubs who frequently chop and change managers.Klopp told Sky Sports: 'The way you behave in a crisis defines what you will be after the crisis. I thought we went through okay, nothing between me and the players, the club, nothing. We knew we are responsible for it but we have to solve it together.",
        "'The main difference here is in a lot of other clubs, the manager would have been sent away. That's not cool but on the other hand, you don't have to go through it for that long!'We're happy we went through it so now we're on the other side of the tunnel and now we have to keep going to get something out of this season.'",
        "Liverpool start the weekend four points behind Manchester United in fourth place in the Premier League - and they have played one game more than the Red Devils.\u00a0However, the Reds have strongly boosted their own hopes of Champions League qualification with their recent run - while Man United recently faltered away at Brighton.\u00a0\u00a0Liverpool's recent performances had changed the feeling around the club - and the German hopes that they will create a stronger base for the next campaign.\u00a0\u00a0Klopp said: 'We all feel better now after winning a few games, it's the biggest mood changer in the world of football.'I'm still looking forward to a new season, that's true, that hasn't changed. We have the information we wanted to have, how the boys go through situations like that. You can always take something out of difficult periods and that's what we did.'The Reds had a 63-game campaign last season, on their way to winning the FA Cup and League Cup, and losing finalists in the Champions League.\u00a0",
        "They then lost Sadio Mane to Bayern Munich, and replacement Luis Diaz has been absent through injury.In addition to this, Klopp admits: 'I make mistakes, obviously,' particularly with some of his line-ups as Liverpool have struggled to match their previous high watermarks.\u00a0",
        "He believes his mentality as a 'calm and thoughtful person' has helped to deal with matters away from the touchline. The German said: 'I learned early to deal with setbacks, difficult moments in life and football.'\u00a0Klopp added: 'Of course, you question pretty much everything. That's very important in lesser-good times that you question the right things. That's a completely normal human thing.'I know my craft, I know what to do with it. That doesn't mean I always have the solution but I don't doubt that. The game is not rocket science. It's football, the pitch size hasn't changed since I've been in the game and a lot of other things.",
        "'I've watched more football than 99.9 per cent of the population on this planet so if I didn't understand it would be really tricky. It's just experience. Things can happen and you want to minimise the time you go through bad spells. This year we struggled with that slightly.'He also believes that Liverpool's future potential will hopefully soothe some of the problems that have arisen during this slightly trickier season. Klopp said: 'I love this team, honestly. It's a really good group.\u00a0'Yes, we will change slightly, but the basis is absolutely great. Age-wise the basis is great, up front, last line, in midfield we have super young talents as well and there's everything there you need to have a really positive and optimistic view of it.'",
        "Following the Brentford game, Liverpool travel to struggling sides Leicester City and Southampton either side of a Premier League home clash against Aston Villa.\u00a0\u00a0"
