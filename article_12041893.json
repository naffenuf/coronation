        "Making time for it is the issue, with almost half (44 per cent) saying they are usually too rushed for breakfast during the week, and 69 per cent saying it is usually a hurried, chaotic affair.According to the stats, Brits would love their weekday breakfasts to be more like their weekend ones, with eight in ten (79 per cent) preferring weekend brunches because they have more time.Alastair Unite, from the New York Bakery Co, said: \u2018We know that weekday family breakfasts can be pretty chaotic. It\u2019s something we can all relate to. Burned toast, slimy eggs and cold beans - we\u2019ve all been there - and shared a laugh or two along the way.\u2018But we also know that people want to make more of breakfast. The research shows that over half of Brits wish they could spend more mealtimes together, with a further 53 per cent agreeing that some of their best memories are created over breakfast.\u2018There\u2019s something special about breakfast and the feelings it creates. That\u2019s why it\u2019s time to ditch plain old toast and shake things up with bagels, the toast of New York.\u2019"
