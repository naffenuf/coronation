        "Now an interview has surfaced, recorded just weeks ago, of the couple laying bare their marriage troubles after Moana, 35, gave birth to their second child Ahi.In a raw conversation with Dr Golly and the Experts, the Australian Survivor star said her postpartum depression was so severe she almost abandoned her family.\u00a0'I just had moments where I felt like I'm not good enough to be [the children's] mum. I need to leave. It was about three occasions all up,' Moana revealed.'I almost got in a car and drove away because I just felt like I wasn't going to be a good enough mom for [Ahi]. It was fear.'",
        "The retired athlete went on to say her postpartum depression went hand-in-hand with her 'anxiety' and 'childhood trauma'.In an emotional moment, she confessed she was 'physically abused'\u00a0throughout 'a large portion of my childhood'.'My anxiety got so bad that I thought I was going to wake up and inherit [the abuser's] anger. So I always thought, \"I don't want to be around my kids if I turn into [that],\"' she confessed.",
        "Isabella then revealed she knew Moana's childhood trauma would be 'triggered' by the 'trauma' of giving birth and asked her to see a 'psychiatrist' about it.\u00a0The podcast was released on Wednesday, but Daily Mail Australia understands it was recorded just weeks before their rumoured break-up.",
