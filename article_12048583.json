        "Danny Ward scored the only goal as Huddersfield made certain of their place in the Sky Bet Championship next season with a 1-0 victory over Sheffield United.",
        "The Terriers needed a point to ensure survival and Ward\u2019s second-half effort proved enough as Neil Warnock\u2019s side avoided a final-day relegation battler against Reading, who tumble into League One as a result of Huddersfield\u2019s triumph.The result caps a remarkable turnaround since Warnock\u2019s appointment at the John Smith\u2019s Stadium in mid-February, with Town losing just one of their last nine league matches including five wins in the last eight.Victory over Yorkshire rivals United lifted Huddersfield five points above the bottom three, with the final round of fixtures to be played on Monday.The Blades, who had already secured their return to the Premier League next season, dominated the early stages and penned the hosts in.Huddersfield shot-stopper Lee Nicholls stood tall to make a great early save and keep out Daniel Jebbison after he raced through on goal in the eighth minute.",
        "Blades striker Jebbison squandered another decent chance to fire the visitors ahead on the half-hour mark as he headed George Baldock\u2019s cross over at the far post.Warnock\u2019s charges continued to absorb the pressure as United hammered on the door, and at stages in the opening 45 minutes, only keeper Wes Foderingham was in the visitors\u2019 half.Sander Berge was the next Blades player to have a crack at goal, but his tame effort barely troubled Nicholls.",
        "The hosts were the first to show after the break with their first big chance of the match.Tom Lees rose highest at the back post to meet Jack Rudoni\u2019s teasing corner but his close-range header was blocked.United manager Paul Heckingbottom quickly rang the changes as he threw on Oli McBurnie and Billy Sharp up front.Foderingham pulled off a good stop to parry Josh Koroma\u2019s effort wide after he nutmegged Chris Basham to force his way into the box.And the pressure told two minutes before the hour as Ward\u2019s crucial stunning strike, a curling left-footed effort from 25 yards which nestled in the bottom corner, fired Town in front.The goal would have come as a huge blow to any watching Reading fans and Huddersfield came close to extending their lead when David Kasumu hit the side netting after being slipped through by Koroma.United pushed hard for an equaliser in the closing stages but Warnock\u2019s charges held firm sparking widespread celebrations in the stands."
