        "Cycling on main roads in England has fallen by nearly a quarter from the peak recorded during coronavirus restrictions, Department for Transport (DfT) figures show.",
        "The decline has sparked fears the Government will fail to hit targets for increasing cycling activity.DfT data demonstrates the surge in cycling \u2013 when Covid restrictions affected travel patterns \u2013 peaked in March 2021. Excellent strategies, guidance and design standards have never been supported with the investment the Government knows is needed to get anywhere close to delivering those targets  Duncan Dollimore, Cycling UK  The amount of cycling on main roads fell by 24.1% between then and the end of last year.But the DfT said cycling remains 11.1% above pre-pandemic levels and had risen by 23.7% since 2013.It has a long-standing target of doubling cycling by 2025 compared with 2013 levels.",
        "Duncan Dollimore, head of campaigns at charity Cycling UK, said DfT plans to boost cycling and walking have consistently lacked funding.He told the PA news agency: \u201cExcellent strategies, guidance and design standards have never been supported with the investment the Government knows is needed to get anywhere close to delivering those targets. It\u2019s great to see cycling in this country riding high at 11% above pre-pandemic levels  Chris Boardman, Active Travel England  \u201cRather than celebrating a 23.7% increase in cycling over eight years, the Government should really be asking how it expects to achieve its own doubling targets in the next two years when it\u2019s just cut dedicated capital funding for cycling and walking by two-thirds for that period.\u201d",
        "A reduction in active travel budgets was announced in March.A DfT spokeswoman said: \u201cCycling levels on roads are up 11% on pre-pandemic levels, while vehicle use currently remains below pre-pandemic levels.\u201cWe are investing around \u00a33 billion up to 2025 to support active travel and, following the peak of cycling during the pandemic, this data clearly shows cycling levels on roads have increased compared to levels seen before 2019.\u201dChris Boardman, the former Olympic cyclist who heads Government agency Active Travel England, said: \u201cIt\u2019s great to see cycling in this country riding high at 11% above pre-pandemic levels.\u201cThe movement for moving is catching on as more of us choose to ride bikes for everyday trips, putting the joy back into journeys.\u201cThis is great for our health, it\u2019s free transport and it helps us to be more connected to our communities. Everyone\u2019s a winner.\u201d"
