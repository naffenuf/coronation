        "Kerri Sackville, author of\u00a0 wants everyone to embrace a little bit of messREAD MORE:\u00a0I'm in marriage counselling because of his disgusting car habitKerri Sackville thinks everyone has The Chair. You know the one. The seat in the corner of your bedroom. Maybe it\u2019s wooden. Maybe it\u2019s cushioned. Maybe it\u2019s an office chair, wheeled away from its deskly destiny.\u00a0",
        "Either way, it doesn\u2019t really matter: you\u2019ve never sat in The Chair and you can\u2019t see it because heaped on top of it are piles and piles of clothes.\u2018Even my very neat partner has a chair,\u2019 says Sackville. \u2018He claims that the clothes are there because they \u201cneed ironing\u201d. Does he iron them? Not that I\u2019ve seen. Could they be hung in the wardrobe while waiting for the mythical ironing?\u00a0Yes. But they remain on The Chair.\u2019 Maybe The Chair offers respite? \u2018When you\u2019re too houseproud to drop your clothes on the floor, but you\u2019re too tired to put them back in the wardrobe, The Chair is there to save the day. After all, if it\u2019s not on the floor, it\u2019s not real mess \u2013 it\u2019s a storage solution!\u2019Sackville, 54, is something of an expert on matters such as The Chair. This week, the Australian author will publish her fifth book: The Life-Changing Magic of a Little Bit of Mess.\u00a0The title is a play on Marie Kondo\u2019s neat-girl Bible, The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying, and the message is about \u2013 no surprise \u2013 why the right amount of clutter is good for you. Life-changing, even.",
        "Sackville had the idea in 2020. She was at home in Sydney when a publisher sent her a book about cleaning. She won\u2019t say which one, but it was all about keeping \u2018a pristine\u2019 home: how you should do \u2018housework schedules\u2019 and why you need \u2018a turbo mop\u2019. The book was also, clearly, aimed at women.",
        "Sackville snapped. \u2018It was lockdown. Life was really hard. Everybody was suffering. And I was, like, seriously? It\u2019s not enough that we survive motherhood, survive this very complex world, survive the pandemic.Oh, and we have to have, you know, perfect bodies, perfect children, perfect relationships and perfect lives. Now we also have to have a perfect home?\u2019 she says. \u2018I couldn\u2019t see the point of it.\u2019A line popped into her head: \u2018Has anybody got to the end of their life and wished they\u2019d spent more time with their steam mop?\u2019 The answer, obviously, was no. So, Sackville started writing a manifesto for mess.When I speak to her over Zoom, her background is an innocuous white wall and a sofa with a few cushions on it. But is there some mess out of shot? \u2018Yes!\u2019 she replies, happily swivelling her laptop camera to show me her study in full.\u00a0There\u2019s tat everywhere: pens, loose change, drinking glasses, playing cards, a stuffed toy octopus, a plastic giraffe, her daughter\u2019s Halloween costume (it\u2019s April) that has never been worn and is still in the packet. \u2018I live my truth!\u2019This is Sackville\u2019s version of mess. It\u2019s not dirt \u2013 \u2018there is nothing life-affirming about mould\u2019 \u2013 it\u2019s just stuff. \u2018Mess is not going to hurt anyone,\u2019 says Sackville. And, she adds, if you embrace not tidying stuff away it\u2019s liberating; you accept \u2018not needing to be perfect\u2019 and \u2018not needing to be pristine\u2019.\u00a0",
        "Is there any science that suggests being messy is good for you? Not much \u2013 although a 2013 study from the University of Minnesota found that clutter was conducive to creativity. (If you google pictures of Albert Einstein\u2019s office, Mark Twain\u2019s writing room or Francis Bacon\u2019s painting studio, it tracks.)",
        "But Sackville believes that mess is good for the soul. If you accept that your house will never be spotless \u2012 unless you have unlimited time, professional help and no responsibilities \u2012 you\u2019ll be a lot less stressed about something as inconsequential as a stray unopened Halloween costume languishing in your study.A bit of disorder makes everyone around you less stressed, too. \u2018I think people are more comfortable in a slightly messy home,\u2019 says Sackville. \u2018Obviously, you don\u2019t want to walk into a hoarder\u2019s room and be stepping over stuff to get to the couch. But I\u2019ve been in homes that are pristine and I felt so anxious \u2013 am I going to spill a drop of my tea, get biscuit crumbs on the floor?\u2019What about children? Sackville has three: a 23-year-old son (tidy, but has moved out), a 21-year-old daughter (messy, and lives at home) and a 15-year-old daughter (also messy, and also lives at home). But as long as their bedrooms are clean in the hygienic sense, Sackville doesn\u2019t mind mountains of clothing on the floor. \u2018When it\u2019s time for vacuuming we\u2019ll just put the clothes on the bed.\u00a0",
        "And if they want to put them back on the floor afterwards, they can.\u2019 Arguing about messy bedrooms with her daughters \u2018genuinely doesn\u2019t seem worth it to me,\u2019 she says. \u2018Just shut the door.\u2019Maybe she\u2019s on to something. Last October, in an interview with this magazine, Marie Kondo admitted that, after she had her third child, even her home \u2018isn\u2019t completely tidy\u2019. (I question the credibility of this statement, but Sackville agrees with Kondo: \u2018In my experience, the third kid really does push you over the edge.\u2019)Kondo isn\u2019t the only one slacking. Last December, Oxford University Press announced its word of the year was \u2018goblin mode\u2019: \u2018a type of behaviour that is unapologetically self-indulgent, lazy, slovenly or greedy, typically in a way that rejects social norms or expectations\u2019.Meanwhile, TikTok\u2019s \u2018frazzled English woman\u2019 videos \u2013 where users praise un-put-together characters such as Ren\u00e9e Zellweger in Bridget Jones\u2019s Diary and Kate Winslet in The Holiday \u2013 have racked up around 32 million views.\u00a0And, on the Miu Miu catwalk at Paris Fashion Week in March, models wore half-buttoned cardigans scrappily tucked into tights. Ultra-neat is out, slapdash is in.About time, too. For several years, social media has been filled with videos instructing people how to \u2018organise\u2019 and \u2018declutter\u2019 their homes. But a big part of the advice has seemed to be that, in order to be tidy, you need to buy new things into which you can decant your old things.\u00a0",
        "Pasta ought to be put into glass jars; pens ought to go into plastic pots; bras, knickers and socks ought to be separated with drawer dividers. It\u2019s just shopping.And as for the cleaning influencers on Instagram who seem to have permanently pristine homes? We are only seeing one tidy photograph of one tidy corner. Who\u2019s to say that, out of shot, there isn\u2019t The Chair?That kind of lifestyle isn\u2019t sustainable, says Sackville. For the viewers or, indeed, the Marie Kondos of the world. These cleaning influencers are like \u2018ducks on the water,\u2019 she says. \u2018It all looks perfect but their little legs are going like mad.\u2019It\u2019s why she wants everyone to embrace a little bit of mess. After all, nobody has got to the end of their life and wished they\u2019d spent more time with their steam mop.The Life-Changing Magic of a Little Bit of Mess by Kerri Sackville will be published on Thursday by HarperCollins, \u00a312.99*"
