And know more than the vast majority of people \u2013 I'm more experienced than anybody who has ever run for the office.\u00a0And I think I've proven myself to be honorable as well as also effective,' he bragged.\u00a0",
        "Biden's likely opponent in 2024, ex-President Donald Trump, earlier expressed his disgust that the president was not making the trip across the pond.\u00a0'Certainly, he should be here as our representative of our country.\u00a0I was very surprised, I think it's very disrespectful for him not to be here,' the former Apprentice host told GB News.\u00a0Trump went on to accuse Biden of not being physically well enough to make the journey to the UK. 'He's got a lot of things going, a lot of strange things happened,' the twice impeached president added.",

They have chatted each other up at global climate events since Biden took office, and during the queen\u2019s funeral last year.\u00a0They also spoke in April when Biden called to say he was sending the first lady to the coronation, and the president expressed interest in meeting with the king in the United Kingdom at a future date, the White House said at the time.\u00a0",
        "Biden was the 13th and final US leader to meet the queen.\u00a0They saw each other when he visited England in 2021 with his wife to participate in a Group of Seven world leader summit. At the time, the queen also invited the Bidens to have tea with her at Windsor Castle.\u00a0",
        "Meanwhile during his MSNBC interview, Biden\u00a0defended his scandal-hit son Hunter, 53, amid investigations for alleged tax violations and lying on a gun permit, insisting: 'My son has done nothing wrong.''I trust him, I have faith in him,' he said.'And it impacts my presidency by making me feel proud of him.'Hunter Biden met with U.S. Attorney for Delaware David Weiss at Justice Department headquarters in Washington D.C. last week, in a sign that the federal investigation of him on tax matters and a gun charge are reaching a conclusion.Weiss and his federal prosecutors are weighing four charges against Hunter - three related to tax crimes, and the fourth a felony charge related to a gun purchase, according to the Washington Post.Meanwhile, Congressional Republicans are stepping up their probes of Hunter Biden's finances and what some of them call the 'Biden crime family.'This week, Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, 89, and House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer said they had heard from a whistleblower.",
        "They described being told about a bribery scheme from when Biden was serving as vice president.'We believe the FBI possesses an unclassified internal document that includes very serious and detailed allegations implicating the current President of the United States,' said Grassley.Grassley later said in an interview that he did not know whether the whistleblower's claims were true.He told Newsmax: 'It is a very serious allegation. I wish I could say that I knew it was true or untrue.'"
