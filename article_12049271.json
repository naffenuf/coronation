        "Both Fijiana Drua and the Queensland Reds have cited winning the collision as means to triumphing in the Super W grand final.",
        "Saturday's decider at Queensland Country Bank Stadium shapes as the Drua's opportunity to win back-to-back titles in just their second year.For the Reds, it is their fifth final after losing four to the NSW Waratahs and a shot at glory after going close so many times before.Drua coach Inoka Male likened Townsville's hot and humid conditions to Fiji and said his players feel at home in their preparations.But aside from favourable weather, Male says his forward pack have learnt some harsh lessons from their recent 45-22 loss in the final round to Queensland.\"There was a lot of miscommunication in that game and our defence is fully prepared now,\" Male told AAP.\"We've watched that game back and the most recent game the Reds have played and will put that into action on Saturday.\"The difference will be the physicality on the field - the team that is more physical will win.\"Reds captain Shannon Parry spoke to the same tune on Friday, indicating both forward packs will dictate how and where the contest is won.Parry said being the underdogs is exactly the motivation her side need to win their maiden title.\"Matching them up front is going to be the first challenge for us,\" said Parry.",
        "\"We know if we can retain the ball and retain that pressure it will go a long way to getting the result we're after.\"They're the reigning champions. They won it last year in their first year of the competition.\"For us, we're happy to take the underdog tag and just go out there and play some footy tomorrow afternoon. Hopefully we can do Queensland proud.\""
