        "SEATTLE (AP) - The Seattle Kraken welcomed leading scorer Jared McCann back to practice on Saturday, but coach Dave Hakstol doesn\u00b4t expect the forward to be available for Game 3 of the Western Conference semifinal series against Dallas on Sunday.",
        "McCann has been out since getting hurt early in Game 4 of Seattle\u00b4s opening-round series against Colorado on a hit from Cale Makar that drew a one-game suspension. McCann\u00b4s injury has not been disclosed, with Hakstol only saying that he\u00b4s working through his \"injury protocol.\"Hakstol said McCann skated a couple of times while the team was in Dallas for the first two games against the Stars. But Saturday\u00b4s optional skate with McCann in a red no-contact jersey was his first stint back with his teammates.\"We\u00b4ll just keep progressing. I don\u00b4t really have an update other than the fact that he\u00b4s on the ice and he\u00b4s able to be out there with the optional skate today, which is a really good step for him,\" Hakstol said. \"We\u00b4ll just continue progressing. Nothing imminent in terms of return.\"McCann led Seattle with a career-high 40 goals and 70 points during the regular season. He was held without a goal and had just one point during the series against Colorado before getting injured in the first period of Game 4 against the Avs when he was hit by Makar after the puck had gone out of play.\"He\u00b4s going to jump back in at a very high level. So first things first, we\u00b4re going to make sure his health is where it needs to be and then he\u00b4s got to be ready to get into the lineup,\" Hakstol said. \"Like I said, it\u00b4s a step by step process.\"",
