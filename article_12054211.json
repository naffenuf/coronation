        "The rabid republicans, Britain-hating BBC and shameless Sussexes have lost.",
        "On a glorious day for Great Britain, undamped by the soggy weather, Britain's Royal Family showed why the monarchy in this country will endure far beyond the reign of the late Queen Elizabeth II.In a timeless Coronation ceremony, rich in tradition but featuring an appropriate degree of modernisation, the strength of the Crown was on display to a global audience of billions.And King Charles III got the moment for which he has waited 70 years \u2013 I haven't always been his biggest fan, but not a foot has been put wrong since the death of his mother and he deserves our support.So how must Prince Harry have felt watching this historic service in the third row with also-ran royals knowing he's spent the past three years trying to torpedo the very institution his beloved grandmother worked so hard to maintain?",
        "The cheeky chappy fa\u00e7ade on full display as he sauntered into Westminster Abbey cracking jokes like he owned the place hid a reality crueller than a receding hairline that makes his mockery of his brother's balding in his autobiography Spare look even more hypocritical.The fifth in line to the throne has missed out on the role of his life \u2013 and deep down he knows that.His late mother Princess Diana's wish was that her youngest son would be there to support Prince William during what she knew would be an undoubtedly testing reign for Charles III, who is trying to follow the GOAT.",
        "But that was before William had found Kate, Diana's successor as Princess of Wales, who showed how her gorgeous family represents the future of the monarchy.And didn't Prince George, Princess Charlotte and little Louis do their grandfather proud yesterday, while making all of our collective hearts swell.The Wales are a family united in service and duty.It was especially touching to see the bond between father and son soon after the most holy moment of the crowning ceremony.Charles and William, whose once rocky relationship has been transformed to an unbreakable union of mutual respect and love, have never been more at one.By contrast, Harry walked into the Abbey isolated and alone, a painful representation of how his family and most of the country now feel about him as a direct result of his destructive behaviour.What a shame the BBC didn't put a camera on the Duke during the controversial pledge of allegiance: 'I swear that I will pay true allegiance to Your Majesty, and to your heirs and successors according to law. So help me God.'If Harry did join millions of us in reciting the oath, then surely he has to call his publisher Penguin Random House quick smart and ask for every copy of his treacherous moanfest Spare to be pulped?",
        "My prediction is he muttered along with the same lack of conviction in which he sang God Save the King at the late Queen's funeral.Sadly, the heavens opened in London during the ceremony.I like to think they were the tears of Meghan Markle watching the wall-to-wall coverage of the Coronation on US TV from her Montecito mansion, fuming at the fact the world has, yet again, realised how much they adore the important traditions of the British monarchy.Despite the weather, there were many small mercies to rejoice in yesterday.Regal Tory Penny Mourdant was no doubt privately thanking her lucky stars that Rishi Sunak never promoted her to a more senior Cabinet job so she could play a central role in history and burnish her credentials for a future run at the top job.Camilla looked truly overwhelmed as she was formally crowned Queen, no doubt wryly wondering: 'How on earth did I end up here?'And thank the Lord the pen used by the new King early in the service didn't leak.But what of the Meghan Markle republican disciples causing disruption on the streets of London, who shamefully tried to distract the horses during the procession, screaming into the abyss while 90 per cent of the country realised yesterday should have been moment of unity, unbothered by divisive politics?",
        "Outside of the BBC, Woke ITV and Sly News, who have become suddenly obsessed with their minority cause, they thankfully proved an irrelevance yesterday.",
        "But the biased and unpatriotic broadcast media has, once again, shown how out of touch it is with the population they claim to represent, with their republican fervour in full display over the past 24 hours.The British Bashing Corporation couldn't help but mock the festivities, with royal correspondent Jonny Dymond labelling the ceremony 'the strangest show in town' and Claudia Winkleman using her Radio 2 show to mock Coronation weekend as 'Tory Christmas'.The Beeb can sneer all they want at our proud traditions, but there's no doubt they will be proven wrong.I believe yesterday's pitch perfect ceremony, the culmination of the most emotional seven months of grief and transition since the death of the late Queen, assures this will not be the last Coronation."
