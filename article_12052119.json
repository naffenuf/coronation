        "In a candid 2019 interview with Glamour, the talented singer opened up about her struggles, saying she thought she was having a heart attack when struck by extreme anxiety, and that she developed a fear of being left on her own.She said: 'Weirdly when I first started experiencing the panic attacks, I developed a fear of being on my own. It's a lot better than it was, I kept thinking, 'if I'm on my own and I have a panic attack, what do I do?'\u00a0'It's like battling with yourself \u2013 my mum got me dolls to paint and I would sit there shaking when she left the house for two minutes\u2026 At first, I was like 'don't leave me on my own, I will literally die'.\u00a0",
        "She said her mother would take her phone with her when she shopped so she could be on hand if Perrie suffered an attack, as well as accompanying her to work.The star also admitted she feared not being able to perform, tour, do interviews and meet fans due to the severity of her condition.She said: 'If I didn't have the other three girls to think about and the tour to prepare for and all the fans that want to see the show to be the best it can be, I don't think I would have come back to work.\u00a0'I was happy to be at home with my family with Hatchi and call it a day. It was that daunting trying to go back to everything.'\u00a0The DNA singer said her anxiety had made her fearful of going out on her own, adding that trains leave her feeling 'claustrophobic', but that going into therapy had changed her life 18 months on.",
        "She said: 'Therapy helped hugely by speaking to someone who has no idea what's going on in your life, you just let it all out and it's the best thing in the world.\u00a0'At first, I was so embarrassed because I thought if I tell everybody I've been to therapy, they're going to think I'm nuts.\u00a0",
        "'I thought people are going to think I'm mental and at one point I thought my mum was going to have to send me somewhere because I was having these dark thoughts, I was thinking differently to the way I would.'\u00a0She is now able to travel on her own and get in a car to visit Alex in Manchester.\u00a0\u00a0The star also credited the support of her family, friends, beloved dog Hatchi and loved ones for helping her through the difficult time, with her cousin and best friend Ellie moving in with her.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If you have been affected by this story, and are in the UK, call The Samaritans at any time, from any phone for FREE, on 116 123 or call Mind's Infoline from Monday to Friday on 03001233393 or text 86463."
