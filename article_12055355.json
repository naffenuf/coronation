        "'But for now, he's focussing on work opportunities and beginning a new chapter in Dubai.'He's definitely single and while Vanessa means a lot to him because of the experience they shared on the show, they're just friends now.",
        "'Joey has a busy life and career and right now his main priority is his house move, which will be a massive change for him.'Meanwhile, Lily\u00a0described herself a 'serial relationshipper' and claimed guys are 'rubbish' on the dating app Hinge following her split.The actress appeared on the Capital Breakfast show back in February to discuss her dating life.\u00a0Hosts Roman Kemp and Sian Welby told Lily: 'We talk about love life quite a lot on this show'Sian went on to say: 'We do, and we quite laugh at our own previous experiences that went horribly wrong. Your character Zoe is very unlucky in love. Can you relate to this, is there any, in your past when you go, I'm cringing still'.Lily then explained: 'I cringe at most things I do. Yeah I've been a sort of serial relationshipper, so I've not had any crazy dating stories however I did go on my mates' hinge the other day and I just despaired. I mean come on!",
        "Roman asked: 'What do you mean?' to which Lily replied: 'The guys, they were rubbish'",
        "Sian then asked Lily: 'What were some of the icks?'Lily quipped: 'I'm sure some of the girls are c*ap too but men are worse. There's a line in the film where my character is looking at this guy and he's got a sentimental quote and she's like 'He's fit enough that I'll overlook the sentimental quote' which is 'every day is a new rainbow' but that would be a bit of a turn off for me.'Sian noted that 'Sentimental quotes are out' with Lily adding: 'Not on the first look at someone, a bit of banter, I sound like I'm on Love Island!'\u00a0The pair called time on their two year relationship after growing apart in recent months it was reported.\u00a0"
