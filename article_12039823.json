        "Multiple reports in Spain indicated Alemany, 60, had been offered a large salary increase to move to Villa Park and work alongside boss Unai Emery.According to Spanish sources, Barcelona knew they could not match the terms on offer from Villa for their director of football.A statement from the LaLiga leaders read: 'FC Barcelona Director of Football, Mateu Alemany, will end his time at the club on the 30th of June to begin a new professional project.'Despite having a contract until 2024, Mateu Alemany has informed the FC Barcelona president, Joan Laporta, of his intention to take a new path in his career, but at the same time assuring that he will complete the summer transfer market with the club.",
        "'Therefore, despite formally leaving the Club on 1 July, thanks to an informal agreement, Mateu Alemany has committed himself to completing the first team's transfer business this summer, even if it should be at the final moments of the transfer window.'Asked about Villa's interest in March, Alemany said: 'This is a private matter of no great importance.
