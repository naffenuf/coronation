        "Bosses of Anheuser-Busch claim that the partnership with Mulvaney was 'not a formal campaign or advertisement'Their former chief creative officer branded the decision to work with the trans influencer as a 'calamitous mistake'It comes as the company\u00a0reported first-quarter earnings of $1.65billion, which topped Wall Street expectations\u00a0The CEO of Anheuser-Busch has unceremoniously disowned the disastrous Dylan Mulvaney stunt \u2013\u00a0 insisting it was 'not a campaign' as a letter to retailers says it was 'just one can'.",
        "Global boss Michel Doukeris addressed the mass backlash over working with trans influencer Mulvaney, 26, for the first time in an earnings call with investors on Thursday.Doukeris told investors there is 'misinformation' spreading on social media about the company's team-up with Mulvaney, according to Fox Business.He added that the company is 'providing direct financial support' to the frontline workers impacted by the boycott.\u00a0Doukeris said: 'We need to clarify the facts that this was one camp, one influencer, one post and not a campaign.'We will continue to learn, meet the moment in time, all be stronger and we work tirelessly to do what we do best: Bring people together over a beer and creating a future of more cheers.'Investors were also told by Doukeris that Bud Light will triple its marketing spend this summer in a bid to woo customers back to the tarnished brand.\u00a0\u00a0The disastrous marketing bid has seen sales for the American flagship beer plummet 26 percent, despite\u00a0Anheuser-Busch reporting first-quarter earnings of $1.65billion.",
        "Doukeris' comments came as a letter was sent to retailers, bars and restaurants by Grey Eagle \u2013 which distributes Anheuser-Busch products around St Louis.\u00a0It read: 'Anheuser-Busch did not intend to create controversy or make a political statement.'In reality, the Bud Light can posted by a social media influencer that sparked all the conversation was provided by an outside agency without Anheuser-Busch management awareness or approval.",
        "'Since that time, the lack of oversight and control over marketing decisions has been addressed and a new VP of Bud Light marketing has been announced.'Bud Light's VP of marketing, Alissa Heinerscheid, took a leave of absence while the VP for Mainstream Brand, Daniel Blake, stepped down some days after.Their sudden departure appears premature in light of the recent comments, which also claim there was no 'management awareness' of the now-infamous campaign.\u00a0The specifics of how the can fiasco erupted remain under wraps. The latest letter claims the Mulvaney can was the brainchild of an outside agency.It is the first time the\u00a0brewing giant has addressed the backlash in detail, after they were hit with a major dip in Bud Light sales following the paid partnership.",
        "The defiant rebuttal against the 'unofficial' campaign comes as Anheuser-Bush reported first-quarter earnings of $1.65billion, which topped Wall Street expectations.\u00a0The brewer posted revenue of $14.21 billion in the period, which also beat forecasts, with the shares rising 6 percent since the beginning of the year and 12 percent in 12 months.It's unclear if the boycott had any impact on these figures, and whether a larger impact on the firm's finances will be visible for the second quarter of the financial year if the controversy and boycotts rumble on.\u00a0\u00a0",
        "Despite the company's attempts to disavow the connection, the video Mulvaney, 26, posted of herself drinking Bud Light at the start of April 2023 used the hashtag #budlightpartner.It implies that she was paid for the partnership, despite the brewing giants now claiming that the beer can and social media posts were not meant to be 'for production or sale to the general public.Todd Allen, most recently the global vice president of Budweiser, has been announced as the new vice president of marketing for Bud Light \u2013 after Heinerscheid and Blake took a leave of absence.Mulvany posted the content to coincide with the NCAA March Madness tournament, before joking she didn't know what sport she was promoting.",
        "After the post on April 1, Anheuser-Busch lost more than $6billion in market capitalization in just six days.The beer giants stock roughly traded at just over five percent decrease in the total share value and the company's market capitalization stood at $113.33billion.Mulvaney posted several videos and images on Instagram for the paid partnership, but it is unclear exactly how much she was paid.A former chief creative officer at Anheuser-Busch branded the decision to use Mulvaney as a 'calamitous mistake'.Robert Lachky told\u00a0STL Today: 'The minute you step into the political or religious spectrum, when you know your target audience is going to have a real issue with this, you know you've alienated at least half of your target audience.",
        "'In the end, people don't like getting preached to, especially when it comes to drinking beer.'He claimed that the marketing changed after Bud Light was bought by Belgian-Based InBev in 2009, when non-US teams were brought in.Lachky added: 'None of these marketing folks has ever been to a NASCAR race, none has been to a football game or a rodeo. That's insanity. That's marketing incompetence.'",
        "It comes after DailyMail.com obtained documents which showed the brewing giant hired two formed GOP aides on the same day it went public with Mulvaney's video.Both Sean McLean and Emily Lynch were named as lobbyists for Bud Light's parent company on April 1.It states the firm, owned by Belgium-based giant InBev, hired lobbyists Origin Advocacy for representation on 'general policy regarding the alcohol-beverage industry.'The account is being handled by Origin founder McLean, and employee Lynch, who are both veteran staffers to GOP politicians.McLean previously worked for Senator Ted Cruz and was the White House liaison for the Commerce Department under President Donald Trump.He also once worked as the legislative director for Senator Marsha Blackburn when she served in the US House of Representatives.Lynch worked as committee staff for Senator Susan Collins before later working as a legislative assistant for Representative Virginia Foxx and former Senator Kelly Ayotte.",
        "According to the New York Post, the company has promised 'there will be an improved screening process before any marketing hits the public.'It comes after Coors Light and Miller Lite both saw bumps to sales while the Anheuser-Busch-owned brewer saw them plunge.",
        "In the week after the campaign launched, April 1, Bud Light dollar sales dipped 6 percent, as Coors Light rose 3.5 percent and Miller Lite 3.1 per cent.As the backlash ramped up against Anheuser-Busch, with Kid Rock opening fire on several cases of the beer, their sales dropped 17 percent in the week of April 18.By comparison, Coors Light saw sales rise by 10.6 percent, while Miller Lite scooped up even more profit with sales rising 11.5 percent.Last week sales of Bud Light had risen slightly, with the company seeing just a 6.7 percent dip in sales, with both their rivals seeing a huge increase of 18 percent.Bud Light is the largest beer brand in the US, but their decision to work with Mulvaney has seriously affected the company.During the NCAA basketball tournament from March 18 to April 1, it was the clear leader of all Light beers, up 15 percent, according to Brewbound.But following the Mulvaney campaign it trailed other beers by at least six percent in bars and restaurants.",
        "Between April 2 and April 15, Beer Board says that their overall volume of sales at bars and restaurants dropped by 34.7 percent.Bud Light has now declined into the fourth spot of the most popular draft beer during the second week of the controversy \u2013 losing out to Coors Light.VP of marketing Alissa Heinerscheid had been hired to overhaul Bud Light's marketing in June 2022 with the idea of freshening up its image.She spoke out before the controversial campaign to say that the company had a 'fratty' image which needed to be changed.Daniel Blake stepped down shortly after Heinerscheid, with both saying they were taking a 'leave of absence'.The firm said both bosses 'decided' to temporarily step down, but their decisions were reportedly not voluntary.'Given the circumstances, Alissa has decided to take a leave of absence which we support. Daniel has also decided to take a leave of absence,' the company said.Blake is a nine-year veteran of Anheuser-Busch and oversaw marketing for both Bud Light and Budweiser.",
        "A replacement wasn't immediately announced. Heinerscheid's job was taken over by Todd Allen, who recently served as global vice president of Budweiser.Blake, who is based in New York, was promoted to group vice president of Anheuser-Busch's mainstream brands in May 2022, according to his LinkedIn page. Before that, he was group VP of marketing for Budweiser and value brands.On March 30, Heinerschied gave an interview to a business podcast in which she said she wanted to make Bud Light less 'fratty' and more 'inclusive'.Two days later, on April 1, Mulvaney - who began transitioning to a woman in 2021 - was unveiled as a brand partner.Several famous faces slammed the brand for their decision, after pro-Trump Kid Rock shot the cans and commented: 'F*** Bud Light, and f*** Anheuser-Busch. Have a terrific day.'John Rich also publicly denounced the brand, saying he would be removing it from his bar in Nashville.Mulvaney has hit back at her critics over the Bud Light deal, telling Rosie O'Donnell on her podcast: 'The reason that I think I am so\u2026I'm an easy target is because I'm so new to this.'I think going after a trans woman that's been doing this for like 20 years is a lot more difficult. I think maybe they think that there's some sort of chance with me \u2026 But what is their goal?",
        "'These people, they don't understand me, and anything that I do or say then somehow gets taken out of context and is used against me, and it's so sad because everything I try to put out is positive.'It's trying to connect with others that maybe don't understand me. It's to make people laugh or to make a kid feel seen.'In the turmoil that ensued after the announcement of the collaboration, Anheuser-Busch issued a statement saying it supported the brand's decision to work with Mulvaney.They added: 'Anheuser-Busch works with hundreds of influencers across our brands as one of many ways to authentically connect with audiences across various demographics.'From time to time, we produce unique commemorative cans for fans and for brand influencers, like Mulvaney. This commemorative can was a gift to celebrate a personal milestone and is not for sale to the general public.'",
        "Bud Light then released a patriotic new advertisement for Budweiser featuring its iconic Clydesdale horses, in an apparent attempt to reset following the controversy.The one-minute spot features shots of the iconic Clydesdales galloping across the country, in open fields, and past landmarks including the Lincoln Memorial and the New York City skyline.However, online users slammed the ad as a pathetic attempt to right the ship that was permanently sent in the wrong direction with the Mulvaney partnership.On April 14, US CEO Brendan Whitworth delivered an apology.'We never intended to be part of a discussion that divides people. We are in the business of bringing people together over a beer,' he said in a statement.He added: 'My time serving this country taught me the importance of accountability and the values upon which America was founded: freedom, hard work and respect from one another.''I care deeply about this country, this company, our brands and our partners,' he added.'I spend much of my time traveling across America, listening to and learning from our customers, distributors and others. Moving forward I will continue to work tirelessly to bring great beers to consumers across our nation.'"
