        "Australia's coronation gift $10,000 to endangered birdFunds will go to conservation of western ground parrotThere are less than 150 of the endangered species alive\u00a0The coronation ceremony will be held on May 6\u00a0A donation to help save a critically endangered species of bird will be Australia's official coronation gift to King Charles III.",
        "The government revealed to honour the King's coronation $10,000 will be put towards the conservation efforts of the western ground parrot (WGP).Also known as the 'Kyloring' by the Noongar people, it is one of the rarest parrots in the world with a population of less than 150.",
        "The endangered birds are only found in a concentrated area of a Western Australian national park, with the final few birds almost wiped out by bushfires in recent years.The national contribution will be made on behalf of the Australian people to Friends of the Western Ground Parrot (FWGP), a charity working to save the parrot.In a statement on Wednesday, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet said the gesture was in line with the 'emerging tradition' of marking royal landmarks with donations to conservation efforts.'Past contributions have gone towards the conservation of the bilby, mountain pygmy possum, numbat and koala,' the statement said.FWGP says its main focus is to raise awareness of the extinction threat facing the parrots.'Out of control bushfires, feral predation and climate change are the major threats facing the Western Ground Parrot,' FWGP's homepage says.'Bringing a critically endangered species back from the brink requires a team effort and Western Australia's Parks and Wildlife Service, Perth Zoo, BirdLife Australia and our organisation, with the support from many others, are working together to prevent Western Australia's rarest bird from becoming extinct.'",
        "The critically endangered parrots are found in southeastern parts of Cape Arid National Park and adjacent areas of Nuytsland Nature Reserve and spend the majority of their time on the ground and therefore can be difficult to spot.Factors such as clearing their habitat for agriculture, predation by feral cats and foxes and dry lightning storms and bushfires have led to the birds being classified as critically endangered.The coronation will be held at Westminster Abbey, with around 2,000 people attending the once-in-a-generation event, on May 6."
