        "Following the royal pomp and ceremony, the coming days are less action-packed. Between last Friday's Eclipse and Jupiter's big move into Taurus next week, it's a quieter period astrologically too. But there's a difference between enjoying a break and resting on our laurels. As Venus moves into Cancer, the skies encourage us to be kind to ourselves. If that means indulging and relaxing today, that's fine by me! It's battery-recharging time.",
        "Read more horoscopes from MailOnline.ARIESMar 21 - Apr 20\u00a0Just because this isn't a good moment to push your luck doesn't mean you shouldn't try to pull it towards you. Do whatever you can to attract it. How? Try putting yourself into a position where luck can help you, which doesn't mean making yourself unnecessarily vulnerable, or taking a big risk. It's about inviting it in (rather than demanding its attention). As Venus changes signs, if you apply this strategy to all events and people, you will get the support you need. Openheartedness is key. The Eclipse has delivered potential for positive change! There's great news in your forecast. Call 0906 751 5601.TAURUSApr 21 - May 21\u00a0In the words of Peter Pan: 'Come with me, where dreams are born, and time is never planned. Just think of happy things, and your heart will fly on wings, forever, in Never Never Land!' Even grown-ups need a happy space; a refuge from their worldly cares and concerns. A place they can retreat to when times get tough . . . where we're able to recuperate, refresh and reinvigorate. Peter also said that as soon as we doubt our ability to fly, we cease to be able to do it. So, trust that you've got what it takes, today. You can soar. The legacy of the Eclipse is to guide you to the future you dreamed of. For great news, call 0906 751 5602.",
        "GEMINIMay 22 - June 22\u00a0When we've got a clearly defined plan and a sense of purpose, whatever we do and whichever path we take heads towards the same destination. But if we've got no real desire to get anywhere, even a fast car on a straight road won't enable us to reach a goal. It's important you visualise and maintain a clear picture of where you really want to be. As long as you establish that, you'll be en route to fulfilling that ambition (even if it sometimes feels like it's a convoluted path towards it). The Eclipse power can transform your life. There's inspiring news in your latest forecast. Call 0906 751 5603.CANCERJune 23 - July 23\u00a0When change comes to call, we can spend so long analysing how it came about that we forget to capitalise on the opportunities it brings. Why did that particular door open? Where did the key come from? These are questions for another time. Right now, with Venus moving into your sign, don't get bogged down in the whys and hows. Seize the moments when they arrive. If a new path appears, it's there to be trodden. If you don't walk it, others will. And where you go, others will follow. Take a brave step forwards today. Let the power of the Eclipse continue to inspire you. Call your four-minute forecast: 0906 751 5604.",
        "LEOJuly 24 - Aug 23Why do we let little tasks grow so big in our minds that we're unable to tackle them? We put things off and our subconscious feeds them so they grow from molehills to mountains. We think something is on the back-burner, but it continues to simmer, using up energy. If we avoid a discussion, we hold it in the back of our minds, creating greater complications. Today brings the courage to do something you've been avoiding. Start and you'll find it far easier than you thought. What a relief! Maximise the energy available to you. The power of the Eclipse can transform your world. Call 0906 751 5605.VIRGOAug 24 - Sep 23\u00a0Soap opera writers understand the value of cliffhangers. These dramatic moments keep us hooked on the storyline and ensure we keep watching. In life, too, there are times when we feel as though we're balanced on a precipice. We'd do anything to feel solid ground beneath our feet. But feeling precarious doesn't mean we aren't safe. You find yourself dealing with a tricky episode in your life. Yet, no matter how challenging the predicament you face, you have the ingenuity and insight to create a calmer ongoing storyline. Use the energy of the Eclipse to change your life. For your key to the future, call 0906 751 5606.",
        "LIBRASep 24 - Oct 23\u00a0FORMER U.S. president Franklin D. Roosevelt said: 'The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.' It's a bold statement \u2014 especially when there are so many emotions and situations we need to be wary of. Yet the ability to distinguish between a real cause for concern and an imaginary problem benefits us all. It's not an easy call. Why don't you make a decision not to be fearful of anyone (or anything) today? As your ruler, Venus, changes signs, with a positive attitude, it's highly likely that good things will come your way. The Eclipse effect continues; change your life for the better. For valuable news, call 0906 751 5607.SCORPIOOct 24 - Nov 22\u00a0Who guards guardian angels? Who holds their hands, watches over them and sees they're OK? Do the more junior angels guard the senior ones? Or is it the other way round? In truth few of us (human or angel) require much more assistance than a greater level of self-awareness, and an enhanced sensitivity to the subtle whispers of the cosmos. Often, our preconceptions are our worst enemies. They prevent us from finding solutions. As Venus changes signs it reveals a surprising new view of your best way forwards. This is an exceptional week. The Eclipse effect makes transformation possible. For good news, call 0906 751 5608.",
        "SAGITTARIUSNov 23 - Dec 21\u00a0They tell us 'never to put off until tomorrow what we can do today'. Yet some decisions are like wine. If they're given some time to mature they develop into a more satisfying form. You're dealing with several situations that can't be delayed, even if you wanted to. But there are other decisions that don't need to be made immediately. Yes . . . you'd like to be able to sort everything out once and for all. Yet if you're prepared to relinquish control, and let them settle, you'll be in a much better position. The Eclipse still has gifts to give: for four minutes of priceless insight and support, call 0906 751 5609.CAPRICORN\u00a0Dec 22 - Jan 20\u00a0All our experiences have their advantages and disadvantages and we react accordingly. We never run out of new things to discover. With the benefit of hindsight, you might choose to change some of the decisions you've made recently. But things are nowhere near as challenging as you think. You're more than able to learn from life's lessons. They will be advantageous in the future \u2014 even though you can't use them to change the past. But you're about to see that there's no need to change that. Wonderful opportunities arise now the Eclipse has re-energised your life. For great news, call 0906 751 5610.",
        "AQUARIUSJan 21 - Feb 19\u00a0The higher we climb the farther we have to fall. We're all aware of this piece of wisdom. The trouble is, we use it to restrict our ambition: if we don't try too hard we won't risk disappointment. You're a natural innovator. You're inspired by your aspirations. You understand the risks involved . . . that making a brave move always brings a chance of failure, but also of success. As long as you're motivated by a desire to ensure the 'right' thing is done, there's no way you'll regret what you're about to do. The Eclipse continues to deliver positive change! There's great news in your forecast. Call 0906 751 5611.PISCESFeb 20 - Mar 20\u00a0They say that we have the most to gain when we have nothing to lose. It's presumably a direct consequence of the fact that when we feel as though we're about to lose, we're prepared to fight to keep afloat. Some people, of course, seem to breeze through life mopping up opportunities that fall into their laps. They never have to enter into conflict. Others have to scrap just to get by. When you're used to fighting to have your needs met, it can be hard to trust offers of help. Don't turn a genuine offer of assistance away today.
