        "Proposals to allow ministers to review and overturn \u201ccontroversial\u201d transport schemes introduced by the mayor of London will be raised in Parliament on Wednesday.",
        "Conservative former cabinet minister Theresa Villiers said the Government should have the power to intervene when there are \u201cvery serious concerns\u201d about decisions relating to transport and air quality.Labour mayor Sadiq Khan\u2019s intention to expand London\u2019s ultra low emission zone (Ulez) has come under fire with a High Court judge last month deciding five Conservative-led councils could challenge the plan.If it goes ahead, the expansion will see drivers in outer London pay a \u00a312.50 daily fee from August 29 if their vehicles do not meet required emissions standards. Where there are very serious concerns about the decision by the Mayor of London I think it's legitimate for my constituents to want the Government to step in and ask that the mayor does something different  Theresa Villiers  The new borders will reach Buckinghamshire, Essex, Hertfordshire, Kent and Surrey.Mr Khan\u2019s team says he is responding to a \u201chealth emergency\u201d by taking action to tackle \u201ctoxic air\u201d in the capital.A spokeswoman for the mayor said it was \u201cdisappointing that some backbench MPs are wasting parliamentary time playing politics\u201d.Ms Villiers, who represents Chipping Barnet, said her proposals could apply to other projects including low traffic neighbourhoods and moves to build on station car parks.She will seek to introduce the Greater London Authority Act 1999 (Amendment) Bill in the Commons through the 10-minute rule motion procedure, although it is unlikely to become law in its current form.",
        "Ms Villiers told the PA news agency: \u201cA key theme is the unhappiness, especially with Ulez but also with a number of the other controversial transport schemes the mayor has introduced.\u201cA lot of my constituents would like the Government to be able to step in and ask the mayor to think again.",
        "\u201cMy Bill, in principle, would allow that to happen although you will appreciate this procedure is more about raising issues really than the promise of actual legislative change.\u201cThe mayor of London\u2019s decisions do have an impact on people living outside London as well.\u201cI\u2019m sure some people will say you can\u2019t interfere with the devolution settlement, but decisions on our capital city can have a massive impact on millions of people who commute in and out, as well as the UK\u2019s economy as a whole.\u201cSo I think there is a place for intervention by ministers. I\u2019m not saying this should happen as a matter of routine. But where there are very serious concerns about the decision by the mayor of London I think it\u2019s legitimate for my constituents to want the Government to step in and ask that the mayor does something different.\u201cWith Ulez expansion, of course we all want to improve air quality in London, there is an air quality issue that needs to be addressed, but this is the wrong scheme at the wrong time.\u201d",
        "Ms Villiers said the scheme will have a \u201cvery limited impact on cleaning up our air\u201d, adding: \u201cAnd yet it will have a really tough impact on many people who are probably already struggling with rising prices and also on small businesses who may be dependent on vans and they simply can\u2019t run a business using the public transport network.\u201dThe mayor\u2019s spokeswoman said: \u201cThe mayor has been clear that the decision to expand the ultra low emission zone London-wide was not an easy one, but necessary to tackle toxic air pollution and the climate crisis. It is disappointing that some backbench MPs are wasting parliamentary time playing politics. Both No 10 and the Transport Secretary have been clear this is a matter for the elected mayor.\u201cWith around 4,000 Londoners dying prematurely each year due to air pollution, there is no time for inaction and it\u2019s people in outer London, particularly the poorest households, who suffer the most from the damaging health effects.\u201cNine out of 10 cars in outer London are already Ulez compliant. For those with the most polluting vehicles the mayor has launched his \u00a3110 million vehicle scrappage scheme \u2013 the largest scheme ever launched by any city in the UK \u2013 to help low-income Londoners, disabled Londoners and micro businesses, sole traders and charities to replace their polluting vehicles.",
        "\u201cThe mayor is calling on the Government to match his action on toxic air by funding a targeted national scrappage scheme or providing funding to London and the surrounding areas to support the switch to cleaner vehicles. The Government have given millions of pounds for scrappage schemes in other parts of the country, but not a single penny to London.\u201d"
