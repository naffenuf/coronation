        "The restaurateur\u00a0has previously\u00a0slammed\u00a0Corden for sending back an 'egg yolk' omelet\u00a0while dining at Balthazar\u00a0He launched into another scathing attack on the Late Late Show host, before slamming Adele\u00a0Motormouth restaurateur Keith McNally has slammed his old foe James Corden's final carpool karaoke - and blasted superstar Adele's\u00a0'inauthentic' appearance.",
        "The New York restaurateur branded Corden as the 'King of Insincerity' before blasting the Hello singer as a 'particularly scary Cruella de Vil.'Corden, 44, released the emotional video on Monday\u00a0with the pair talking about how The Late Late Show host had helped the Grammy winner, 34, through her split with Simon Konecki.Both appeared to be holding back tears as she revealed that a verse in her song I Drink Wine was inspired by Corden.But McNally, London-born owner of the celebrity hotspot in Soho, branded the pair's behavior fake, saying: 'Last week was Corden's final carpool and his most cringe-inducing.",
        "'His guest was his \"great\" friend Adele whose make-up was so hideously overdone and fingernails so long she resembled a particularly scary Cruella de Vil.'Corden and Adele are brilliant performers, but like many brilliant performers they're profoundly inauthentic.'Never more so than when they're being \"honest\" about themselves - as inauthentic people tend to do ALL THE F***ING TIME.\u00a0'As this carpool was part of Corden's last Late Night Show both him and Adele Went to Town being \"honest\" about themselves.'It was sickening. At one point, Adele theatrically broke down on camera. It was Complete, F***ing SCHLOCK.'And of course James Corden - The King of Insincerity Himself - went along with it. It was the biggest pile of HORSE SH*T I've seen in 40 years.'",
        "Initially he said that he had 'always loved' the carpool karaoke, but then launched into his scathing attack on the singer - full name Adele Adkins - appearance on the final one.\u00a0Adele finalized her divorce with Simon in March 2021, two years after announcing their split, and revealed that she went on holiday with James, his wife Julia Carey, their three children, and her son Angelo, 10.She has lost considerable weight since first becoming a star in 2008, with Adele's changing facial features also sparking claims she may have had cosmetic surgery.",
        "Breaking down into tears she said: We were on our way home and my mood had changed and it was like the first year that I felt like I had to hold myself accountable, for just being an adult, whereas the year before that I left Simon, you and Jules and the kids were so integral in looking after me and Angelo.'It is not the first time that the restaurateur, who also owns Minetta Tavern and Morandi, has clashed with Corden.He banned the star from his restaurant after Corden and his wife Julia dined at the restaurant with friends. Julia asked for an all-yolk omelet - something that is not on the extensive brunch menu.",
        "When it arrived, the dish contained some egg whites. Corden sent it back to the kitchen and when it returned, he says it was still 'wrong'.McNally first shamed Corden on Instagram, telling his followers how the comedian had twice abused staff.He said: 'James Corden began yelling like crazy to the server: 'You can't do your job! You can't do your job! Maybe I should go into the kitchen and cook the omelet myself!'Corden addressed the controversy on his show and issued an apology, causing McNally to forgive the comic and unban him.",
        "But McNally then laid into him a second time, reacting to text messages Corden sent to a journalist which said he 'never screamed at anyone'In a post on Instagram McNally said: 'LAST POST ON THIS NON-STORY:'I don't want to over-egg the pudding, but in Friday's London Times Corden flip-flopped and told a massive lie AGAIN:''I never screamed at anyone, I didn't shout, didn't call anyone a name or swear or use derogatory language\u2026 How is it remotely a thing? When that person who posted the story wasn't even there.''On second viewing, I found his TV 'confessional' contrived and phony. The actor will say anything to save his bacon.'In the scheme of things my opinion means nothing, but after Friday's interview and a second look at his fraudulent confessional, I've given up on James Corden. For Good.\u00a0END OF STORY.'",
        "He didn't clarify whether Corden was formally re-banned, but the post suggest he's unlikely ever to return to the restaurant.In a stream of text messages, Corden said the incident and its backlash has 'been the most surreal moment,' while adding that McNally was not present when his wife Julia was served the wrong order.'I mean, it's so odd,' he writes. 'I never screamed at anyone, I didn't shout, didn't call anyone a name or swear or use derogatory language \u2026 how is it remotely a thing? And that be OK?'And now it's fact, and that's that. When the person who posted the story wasn't even there. Just so odd.'He added: 'I have never talked about eggs this much.'There are only two omelets on the menu at Balthazar; the $25 Omelet with Herbs, and the $27, Egg-White Omelet. Both come with a side of home fries or salad.Servers explained to DailyMail.com that Corden was asking for something that is not offered and was angry when it wasn't up to his standards."
