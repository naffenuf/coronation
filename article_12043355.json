        "Ineos Grenadiers\u2019 deputy team principal Rod Ellingworth has said the British outfit is open to launching a women\u2019s road racing team in the next couple of years.",
        "The Grenadiers, founded in 2010 as Team Sky and boasting one of the biggest budgets in the sport, have long faced questions over potential investment in a women\u2019s squad \u2013 something rival teams including Trek-Segafredo, Jumbo-Visma and Movistar have done with considerable success.In 2021 the team\u2019s former chief executive Fran Millar said the idea had been discussed as far back as 2012 but rejected at board level by Sky, which backed the team until Sir Jim Racliffe\u2019s Ineos took over in 2019.The Grenadiers last year signed French mountain bike world champion Pauline Ferrand-Prevot to their off-road roster, making her their first female rider, but Ellingworth has now said they are open to further expansion into women\u2019s racing.\u201cWe\u2019re certainly looking at moving forward,\u201d Ellingworth said. \u201cObviously bringing Pauline in at the back end of last year, purposefully bringing Pauline in to support her in her Olympic mountain bike campaign.\u201cShe made a brilliant start last week (winning at the French Cup in Gueret) in the world champion\u2019s jersey and she\u2019s been a fantastic addition to the team, so we\u2019re moving in the right direction.\u201dFerrand-Prevot, 31, was a world champion on the road in 2014 and has talked of returning to the discipline after the Paris Olympics next summer.",
        "Asked if she might be able to do that in an Ineos jersey, Ellingworth added: \u201cWhy not? I\u2019ve always said, you\u2019ve got to follow riders\u2019 dreams and ambitions. You get hold of a rider with really big ambitions and see where they want to go.\u201cYou decide then as a team, are you going to go on that journey or not? If Pauline had the ambition of riding the Tour de France or whatever in the future then what a great story that would be.\u201d",
        "Ineos expanded into off-road racing when they signed Tom Pidcock, the men\u2019s Olympic mountain bike champion and former cyclo-cross world champion, for the start of the 2021 season, and Ellingworth said further expansion could follow.\u201cThere\u2019s no real barrier,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a focus thing, the focus of the team and the direction we want go in.\u201cWhat we decided a little while back was to broaden out and that was with the mountain bike team with Tom and his ambitions across different disciplines within the sport, then bringing Pauline in.\u201cI think we\u2019re showing we are looking to spread our wings and do some other things. I think for us all it\u2019s to not just be doing the same things year on year. We\u2019re an ambitious team with ambitious goals and we want to keep moving forward. I think we shall be going in the right direction.\u201d"
