        "Rishi Sunak and world leaders discussed climate change, trade and sporting rivalry as the Prime Minister held a series of meetings ahead of the King\u2019s coronation.",
        "The calendar of pre-coronation diplomacy, which came amid a difficult set of local election results for Mr Sunak, saw the Australian and New Zealand prime ministers, the Emir of Qatar and Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva arrive in Downing Street for separate meetings with the PM.Climate change and trade talks dominated discussions, while the war in Ukraine also featured as Mr Sunak held the series of short engagements over the course of Friday.Australia\u2019s Anthony Albanese said that the relationship between the two countries had \u201cnever been stronger\u201d, while New Zealand\u2019s Chris Hipkins praised ties as \u201cthe best it has been in a long time\u201d.",
        "Mr Albanese, who spoke to reporters after the head-to-head, stressed the value of the recently agreed UK-Australian free trade deal and looked ahead to it coming into force at the end of the month.He praised the \u201copportunities that presents for Australian businesses to have growth here in the UK and also, consequently, UK businesses to have growth in Australia\u201d.Mr Albanese said the two leaders also discussed how \u201cpeople-to-people relations\u201d could be \u201cexpanded\u201d, referencing working holiday visas.",
        "He said the two men also discussed \u201cco-operation on climate change\u201d.He added: \u201cBoth governments believe there are enormous economic opportunities to be seized from action on climate change and, of course, our co-operation in the Indo-Pacific.\u201d",
        "He praised, too, the \u201cbipartisan\u201d nature of climate action in the UK, adding: \u201cIt should be in Australia as well.\u201dMr Albanese also added he was glad the free trade deal has been completed in time for the King\u2019s coronation, which he called a \u201chistoric event of enormous significance\u201d.The pair also exchanged jokes about the sporting rivalry. This summer\u2019s Women\u2019s World Cup, hosted by Australia and New Zealand, as well as the upcoming Ashes series, both got mentions as Mr Albanese said that star striker Sam Kerr would help Australia \u201cbring it home\u201d.Mr Sunak replied: \u201cI\u2019m sure the Lionesses may have something to say about that.\u201dLater, Mr Sunak and Mr Hipkins met over a plate of sausage rolls and tomato ketchup as the UK Prime Minister said that the \u201cfriendship and partnership between our countries is as strong as ever\u201d.The New Zealand leader, who stopped to chat to reporters after he left the meeting, said: \u201cWe discussed a range of areas in which New Zealand and the UK have mutual interests, that was a very positive conversation.\u201dHe said the pair discussed the implementation of the free trade agreement between the countries, calling it a \u201csignificant milestone and a significant future opportunity for us to grow trade between both of our countries\u201d.",
        "The meeting between Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and Mr Sunak saw the Prime Minister stress the \u201cclose partnership\u201d on issues such as the war in Ukraine and regional security, while the Qatari leader spoke of the importance of last year\u2019s World Cup, saying the country was \u201cvery proud\u201d of the success of the footballing competition.In a statement, following the meeting with the emir, a Downing Street spokesman said: \u201cThe leaders discussed the exciting opportunities to deepen co-operation between our two countries, including through greater investment in strategic industries such the partnership between Qatar and Rolls-Royce to invest in ground-breaking green engineering projects.\u201cThey highlighted the unique joint RAF squadrons operating in Qatar and committed to further develop our defence co-operation.\u201cTurning to international affairs, the leaders shared their deep concern at the unfolding conflict in Sudan. They stressed the importance of diplomatic efforts to facilitate talks between the parties, to end the violence and transition to a civilian-led democratic government.\u201cThe Prime Minister also welcomed Qatar\u2019s principled support for Ukraine in the face of Russia\u2019s invasion and they agreed our governments would continue to work together to support Ukraine\u2019s defence and recovery.\u201dAmnesty International UK criticised Mr Sunak for his meeting with Sheikh Tamim.Allan Hogarth, the group\u2019s head of policy and government affairs, said that the Prime Minister should have used the meeting \u201cas an opportunity to press him over the unfinished business of compensating thousands of migrant workers who were systematically exploited in Qatar in the run-up to the World Cup\u201d.",
        "He added: \u201cThe PM should be using what he calls the UK\u2019s great partnership with Doha to insist that Qatar abolishes its disgraceful anti-LGBTQ+ laws, as well as lifting unacceptable restrictions on free speech and on women\u2019s rights.\u201dThe final meeting of Friday saw Mr Lula da Silva arrive in Downing Street, where he was greeted by crowds of supporters and protesters at the gates.Mr Sunak joked to the left-wing leader that he hoped their conversation would be \u201cless fierce than the competition between England and Brazil on the football field recently\u201d, as he announced an \u00a380 million UK investment in the Brazilian Amazon Fund to prevent deforestation.The Brazilian president, who spoke through a translator, told the Prime Minister that his presence in the UK was not just for the coronation but to \u201cre-establish normal relations\u201d.Apparently referring to his controversial predecessor Jair Bolsonaro, he said that this meeting was part of Brazil\u2019s \u201ccomeback\u201d.\u201cThis is Brazil\u2019s comeback in its relations with the world,\u201d he said.He said the country \u201cisolated itself\u201d in recent years, but said that Brazil wanted to come back and have discussions on trade.Focusing too on climate change, he stressed the need for rich countries to support poorer nations\u2019 efforts to prevent deforestation.Meanwhile, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer also met with Australia\u2019s Mr Albanese, New Zealand\u2019s Mr Hipkins and Israel\u2019s president Isaac Herzog."
