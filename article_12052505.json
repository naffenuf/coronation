        "Author Tom Bower says King Charles III should \u2018cut Harry and Meghan off\u2019\u00a0Read More:\u00a0King Charles is all smiles ahead of his and Camilla's Coronation\u00a0How are YOU celebrating the Coronation? Send your pictures and videos to pictures@mailonline.co.uk\u00a0Tom Bower, author of an insider's account of Revenge: Meghan, Harry and the war between the Windsors, has stated that now is the time for King Charles III to cut his son and daughter-in-law off, once and for all.",
        "Chatting to Jo Elvin on Mail Plus's Palace Confidential, the 76-year-old spoke candidly about how he thinks Charles should handle his youngest son going forward.When asked what his thoughts were on Harry, Meghan and their fractured relationships with his family, Tom said: \u2018Well I think King Charles has played it badly, that\u2019s the problem.\u2018I don\u2019t think he realised the full nature of Meghan\u2019s vindictiveness and her poisonous attitude towards relationships.\u2019He went on: \u2018And I think he should have closed her down and shouldn\u2019t have let them give their children titles and all the rest.",
        "\u2018He\u2019s a father clearly with a conscience that he somehow hasn\u2019t helped Harry in his youth, but now I think it\u2019s up to him to make it absolutely clear that the Montecito Royals are cut off and have absolutely no role whatsoever in Britain.\u2019Harry, 38, and Meghan, 41, moved into their $14 million mansion in Montecito, California, after they stepped back from their royal duties in 2020.\u00a0The Duke of Sussex jetted in from Los Angeles to UK for the coronation on a commercial American Airlines\u00a0 on Friday, amid gobsmacked passengers, landing\u00a0at 11.23am at London Heathrow.He's leaving his wife and two children at home, and is\u00a0intending to fly back to California straight after the historic ceremony ends this afternoon so he can make it to see Archie on his fourth birthday.",
        "\u00a0There is speculation he will have no formal role in the service at Westminster Abbey and may even be sat several rows back from his brother William and other working royals.Royal commentators have considered whether he will even be allowed to fit within the processions to the Abbey. They have also suggested that he could face \u2018uniform humiliation\u2019 as he may not be allowed to wear his military garb.There was no sign of Harry last night at a family dinner ahead of Charles' big day.\u00a0Prince Andrew joined his children, the Tindalls, Princess Anne and her husband, the Kents and the Wessexes at Mayfair club Oswald's, which is owned by British entrepreneur Robin Birley.Birley also owns and runs 5 Hertford Street, which is where Prince Harry and Meghan Markle had their first date.Oswald's is the most exclusive of London's private members' clubs, with the Queen Consort and\u00a0Boris Johnson\u00a0and his wife Carrie among those who frequent the venue."
