The man died at the scene.Police took the body into custody and said an investigation was underway.Accusing people of blasphemy in Pakistan is common.Last month, the Pakistani police arrested and later released a Chinese national named Tian, who was working in Pakistan on a dam project and was accused by the locals of blasphemy.In February, an angry mob entered a police station in Pakistan\u00b4s eastern city of Lahore, snatched a person accused of blasphemy from his cell and killed him.",
