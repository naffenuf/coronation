        "British publishers and broadcasters including GB News and TalkTV have said they are \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d by what they call a \u201crestricting\u201d of access to pool video footage of the coronation by the BBC.",
        "The companies, along with industry body News Media Association and local news video service Local TV, have issued a statement which said the BBC is \u201cdenying UK citizens the opportunity to enjoy this event of major public interest and national importance on the platform of their choice\u201d.Opposing the \u201cBBC blackout\u201d, a joint statement read: \u201cGiven the historic significance of the occasion, all efforts should have been made by the BBC to ensure that the footage \u2013 which is created using licence fee payer money \u2013 is distributed as widely as possible to allow UK citizens to witness this event, and the BBC has not fulfilled this obligation.\u201cThe decision to charge UK media companies an excessive commercial fee (with no visibility of true costs) seems perverse when the BBC is allowing foreign publishers and broadcasters the same footage for free.\u201cThese foreign broadcasters and publishers will be allowed to stream or broadcast footage in the UK despite restrictions on UK media.\u201cThe BBC (together with Sky and ITN) has repeatedly delayed and prevaricated on this issue since the death of Queen Elizabeth in September last year in an anti-competitive manner.\u201d",
        "The statement also said the BBC must \u201curgently reconsider\u201d its position and allow all members of the British public who want to watch the coronation \u201cthe choice to access the event where they wish to do so\u201d.",
        "The BBC has been contacted for comment."
