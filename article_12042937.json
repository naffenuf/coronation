        "Rishi Sunak has said that he has received scam text messages before, as he announced plans to crack down on fraudsters.",
        "The Prime Minister, on a visit in Buckinghamshire to promote the Government\u2019s new fraud strategy, said that he had received fake delivery messages before.He did not say when this occurred, but told broadcasters he had not fallen for it \u201clargely because I don\u2019t have time now to answer my phone anymore\u201d.The new strategy will include banning cold calls on all financial products, such as those relating to insurance or sham cryptocurrency schemes, the Government said. It is really important that people don't feel embarrassed. There's stigma to talk about it. People feel that somehow they have done something wrong. That is not the case  Rishi Sunak, Prime Minister  It also plans to work with Ofcom to use new technology to further clamp down on number \u201cspoofing\u201d, so fraudsters cannot impersonate legitimate UK phone numbers.Under the plans, banks will also be allowed to delay payments from being processed for longer to allow for suspect payments to be investigated.The Government said it will also ban other devices or methods commonly harnessed by scammers to reach thousands of people at once \u2013 such as so-called \u201csim farms\u201d and review the use of mass-texting services to keep these technologies out of the hands of criminals.Sim farms are devices that can be loaded with hundreds of sim cards and controlled from a computer. Fraudsters use them to send thousands of scam texts at once.",
        "The Prime Minister, who said that there was an unfortunate \u201cstigma\u201d attached to falling for a scam, said he had never been a victim himself.\u201cWe were just participating in a workshop. I have, like almost everybody, received one of these text messages claiming to have a delivery that I need to pay for.\u201dHe added that \u201cmost of our families have been impacted by this\u201d.\u201cIt is really important that people don\u2019t feel embarrassed. There\u2019s stigma to talk about it,\u201d he said.\u201cPeople feel that somehow they have done something wrong. That is not the case.\u201dMinisters said that to make it easier for victims to report fraud and rebuild confidence that cases are being dealt with properly, a new system will be up and running within the year.It will replace the current Action Fraud service, the UK\u2019s fraud reporting centre.Backed by a \u00a330 million investment, the new system will provide a simpler route for reporting fraud online, with reduced waiting times and an online portal to allow victims to get timely updates on the progress of their case, the Government said.A new anti-fraud champion, Anthony Browne MP, has been appointed.Opposition parties criticised the plan as not doing enough.Yvette Cooper, Labour\u2019s shadow home secretary, said: \u201cThis plan is too little, too late, and fails to match the scale of the problem.",
        "\u201cAll the Home Secretary has delivered is a rebadging of existing national teams, and a re-announcement on the replacement of Action Fraud from almost two years ago.\u201d"
