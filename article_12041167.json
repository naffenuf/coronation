She lets me know everything.'This message was kind of 'ok we're going to McAlester, I'll see you around 5.'It was just different but I also didn't think anything of it because they were maybe in a hurry.'Officials discovered seven bodies on the property around 3pm at 14600 Holly Road in the rural town of Henryetta, Interim PIO Gerald Davidson Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigations told DailyMail.com.The Oklahoma Department of Corrections prison records show McFadden was convicted of first-degree rape in 2003 and released in October 2020, the news outlet said.",

The teen's grandfather reported their communications to prison officials, according to an affidavit from a Department of Corrections investigator.\u00a0The Websters, who moved to the area two years ago, revealed that they were completely unaware of McFadden's past, adding: 'We had a read on him that he was a little weird but we felt comfortable\u00a0 especially knowing several of our daughters' friends would go over there all the time and hang out.'Tiffany would come over here to our house\u00a0 and stay here on the weekends and we never suspected any kind of maliciousness.'Brittany's father Nathan, who called his daughter his 'right hand side kick' also said that his daughter had spent the weekend with the McFadden's family several times before.He told News On 6 that his daughter was selected to be Miss Henryetta at the [National American Miss pageant] in Tulsa and represent her town this summer.\u00a0",

I am just lost.'\u00a0The grim discovery in Oklahoma keeps the U.S. on a torrid pace for mass killings in 2023 and could push the number of people slain in mass killings past 100 for the year, according to a database maintained by The Associated Press and USA Today in a partnership with Northeastern University.\u00a0\u00a0"
