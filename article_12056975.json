        "James Nesbitt has said he thinks it is a sign of \u201cprogress\u201d that every main political party in Northern Ireland turned up for the King\u2019s coronation.",
        "Political leaders from across the world were in attendance at the ceremony in Westminster Abbey on Saturday, including Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O\u2019Neill and DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson.",
        "The Northern Irish actor, 58, is taking part in the continued celebrations of the historic event by performing a poetry reading at the coronation concert on Sunday evening.Speaking backstage ahead of the event, he told the PA news agency he was \u201cvery impressed\u201d with the King when he met him a few years ago at a project celebrating Northern Irish produce, as he took \u201csuch an interest\u201d.Reflecting on the coronation, he said: \u201cI\u2019m just so delighted in the sense that every political party turned up yesterday for it and I think that\u2019s progress.",
        "\u201cIn a sense, although a lot of people might disagree with me\u2026 and we all have our own opinions about it, but I feel that I\u2019m representing an awful lot of people from where I come from, and I\u2019m glad that he (the King) takes such an interest in the place.\u201dNesbitt added that it was a \u201creal privilege\u201d to be asked to read the poem at the celebratory concert, which was written for the occasion by Daljit Nagra, chairman of the Royal Society of Literature.",
        "It will come as part of the Lighting up the Nation segment of the event which will see colourful illuminations light up landmarks across the UK.Choreographed lasers, projections and drone displays will radiate over historic bridges and buildings in cities including Blackpool seafront in Lancashire, Sheffield Town Hall and Newcastle\u2019s Tyne Bridge.Light shows will brighten up Belfast, Edinburgh and Cardiff at various locations.On Saturday, a 21-gun salute rang out from Hillsborough Castle in County Down to mark the coronation of the King.Ms O\u2019Neill said she was attending the event to \u201crepresent the whole community\u201d in Northern Ireland.\u201cMy determination is to keep moving forward, and to represent the whole community\u201d, she tweeted on the morning of the ceremony.\u201cThe political landscape across our island is changing. My focus is on building a shared future for all.\u201dHer attendance at the event was seen as another demonstration of the markedly improved relations between the republican movement and the royal family since the peace process."
