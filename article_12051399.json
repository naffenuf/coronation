        "As wholesale shipping costs skyrocketed, furniture retailers, such as Dunelm, were particularly badly hit because a number of products are sourced from Asia.\u00a0But now, as shipping costs have fallen back to pre-pandemic levels, Dunelm has discounted the prices on thousands of its items.\u00a0Over the next two weeks, over a thousand products will have lower prices -\u00a0with an average fall of 14%, or \u00a311.76.And the good news is that the discounts are available both in stores and online.\u00a0Some of the discounts Dunelm fans could get include 30% off the price of a double hanging egg chair - which has been reduced from \u00a3499 to \u00a3349.\u00a0Another of the price cuts includes an Ottoman bed which will be reduced from \u00a3999 to \u00a3799, and a London Wall mirror has been reduced by \u00a320 to \u00a355.\u00a0",
