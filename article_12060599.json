        "Joanna Cherry has threatened to sue a comedy club after it cancelled the Edinburgh Festival Fringe show she was set to appear in because of her views on trans rights.",
        "Lawyers acting for the SNP MP wrote to the The Stand Comedy Club on Monday demanding the venue issue a statement acknowledging it \u201chas acted unlawfully by discriminating against our client\u201d, apologise, and reinstates the August event, and if not legal action would begin.The Edinburgh South West MP said: \u201cI am prepared to take whatever legal action is necessary to vindicate my right to not be misrepresented and not to be discriminated against.\u201dThe club had been set to host an event in which the MP was to be interviewed, as part of a series of In Conversation\u2026 shows, but the Stand said \u201ckey operational staff\u201d had raised concerns about the MP\u2019s views and made clear they did not want to work at the event.Ms Cherry has been a vocal critic of the Scottish Government\u2019s gender recognition reforms.The Stand Comedy Club has been approached for comment.",
        "Announcing the threat to take legal action, unless they agreed to the \u201creasonable requests\u201d, Ms Cherry said the action was \u201cnot about money\u201d.\u201cMy primary goal is to have the actions of The Stand acknowledged as unlawful and to ensure the event proceeds,\u201d she said.\u201cI have asked The Stand to apologise to me too. If they don\u2019t agree with my reasonable requests, I intend to ask the court to decide on the issue.",
        "\u201cI hope that my actions in defending myself will give courage to everyone particularly women who wish to express views on legitimate issues of public interest.\u201cThat, after all, is the very job of a politician and one of the reasons I entered politics in the first place.\u201dMs Cherry, herself a King\u2019s Counsel, said she had been \u201cgreatly heartened by the support\u201d and that she had \u201creceived the opinion of the eminent and leading human rights advocate Aidan O\u2019Neill KC who considers that The Stand have acted unlawfully\u201d.\u201cThe actions of The Stand and all that has followed thereon are symptomatic of a wider problem in our society. I am very concerned that those who hold perfectly legitimate views on a variety of issues, including women like me, are regularly being misrepresented, de-platformed and, in some cases, facing damage to or the loss of our livelihoods,\u201d she said.\u201cThis is often accompanied by online abuse and threats.\u201cThe debate on gender self-identification is a very important one which must be allowed to take place, but I am a woman of many parts who was engaged to talk about my political life in general and I see the cancelling of my one-hour event as the thin end of the wedge.\u201dLast week, the club, co-founded by SNP MP Tommy Sheppard, said: \u201cFurther to our previous policy statement on this matter, following extensive discussions with our staff it has become clear that a number of the Stand\u2019s key operational staff, including venue management and box office personnel, are unwilling to work on this event.",
        "\u201cAs we have previously stated, we will ensure that their views are respected.\u201cWe will not compel our staff to work on this event and so have concluded that the event is unable to proceed on a properly staffed, safe and legally compliant basis.\u201d"
