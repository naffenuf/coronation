Maybe payback or karma for what he did to that young kid?'\u00a0'I don't give a f**k, I don't really care,' he said, the Courier Mail reported.The court heard Martin had a severe personality disorder, as well as narcissistic and psychopathic traits due to a difficult childhood where he was neglected by his mother.At the time of the attack, Sikorsky and Martin had been chatting outside of their cells and were believed to be friends.",
