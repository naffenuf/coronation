        "The King and Archbishop of Canterbury are both \u201cvery pleased\u201d with how the coronation went, the Dean of Canterbury has revealed.",
        "The Very Rev Dr David Monteith, speaking from the Big Lunch at Canterbury Cathedral, said: \u201cThe King\u2019s very pleased with the day and even the rain didn\u2019t dampen the spirits.\u201cIt was very clear everyone was out to enjoy themselves.\u201dMr Monteith, who knows the archbishop well, added: \u201cI think he\u2019s very pleased with how it went and the feedback he\u2019s getting from others suggests it\u2019s gone down really well.\u201cOne of the things that he noticed a lot was just how extraordinary the music was and how moving the music was, both some of the traditional music that was reused from previous coronations but also some of the new music that has been commissioned especially for the occasion.\u201cAnd somehow, when you get beautiful music and the ambience of Westminster Abbey and all the wonderful colours and robes and so on, somehow that carries the weight of the occasion in an extraordinary way, so I think that was one of the things he really reflected on.\u201d",
        "He added: \u201cI think there was a concern that the fundamental theme of service stood out and was very visible to everyone, so I think he was very pleased by the end of it that that was communicated with such clarity.\u201dOn the archbishop\u2019s relationship with the King, he said: \u201cOf course there\u2019s a privacy about that relationship that\u2019s so important, that\u2019s held special and sacred.\u201d",
        "The sun shone on Canterbury Cathedral as a few hundred people flocked to enjoy the Big Lunch in the precinct, with music from the Salvation Army band.Reflecting on the occasion, Mr Monteith said he thinks the feeling from the coronation day has \u201cspilled\u201d into today\u2019s Big Lunch.He said: \u201cI think that lovely combination from the seriousness and the solemnity of the service and then the sense of party on the streets, that\u2019s a lovely combination that I think characterised the day.\u201cAnd it\u2019s spilled over into this day afterwards \u2013 the cathedral precinct\u2019s full of people here, the Salvation Army band played and people are enjoying their picnic.\u201cAnd when you start looking at whose here, you see there\u2019s a real cross-section of society and at its best that\u2019s what these occasions do, they bring people together and we need to come together at a time like this.\u201d",
        "The archbishop wandered around the crowd of picnickers, speaking to people and taking selfies.A woman dressed in a Union flag dress and head-boppers at the event curtsied when she met the archbishop.Michelle Downer, 45, from Canterbury, said: \u201cI did this really embarrassing thing. I curtsied to him.\u201cBut isn\u2019t it amazing to be at the cathedral and meeting Justin Welby?\u201d",
        "On the Big Lunch, she said: \u201cI love seeing everyone come together. Why would you not want to be here?\u201dShe added that she \u201cdidn\u2019t move from the TV\u201d for the whole of the coronation celebrations.She then explained how her husband had been decorating and she told him he needed to change before coming in to watch the ceremony \u2013 which he took very seriously, changing into a waistcoat and tails for the event."
