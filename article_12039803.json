        "The 2023 Met Gala\u00a0returned to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City on Monday evening, with everyone from Kim Kardashian to Paris Hilton attending the annual fundraising event.Since 1948, stars have ascended the majestic staircase into a\u00a0very exclusive party where no selfies are allowed.\u00a0In keeping with tradition, the event was held on the first Monday of May. It was scheduled to begin at 6:30PM EST on May 1, 2023.\u00a0This year, the ball's theme was Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty. The late German designer was Chanel's long-time creative director. He passed at age 85 in 2019.\u00a0His beloved cat,\u00a0Choupette, was even invited to the festivities.The decision to honour Karl has sparked controversy given the many offensive remarks he made over the years, from slamming the #MeToo movement to opposing same-sex marriage.'I\u2019m against it for a very simple reason: In the 60s they all said we had the right to the difference. And now, suddenly, they want a bourgeois life,' he told Vice of same-sex marriage.\u00a0",
        "'It\u2019s difficult to imagine\u2014one of the papas at work and the other at home with the baby. How would that be for the baby? I don\u2019t know. I see more lesbians married with babies than I see boys married with babies. And I also believe more in the relationship between mother and child than in that between father and child.'\u00a0",
        "While he ultimately showed his support for same-sex marriage at his spring 2013 Chanel haute couture show, he still said he was 'less keen' on same-sex couples adopting children, according to AP.Along with the Vogue editor-in-chief, Anna Wintour, who runs and hosts the annual event, the 2023 Met Gala was also co-hosted by Penelope Cruz, Dua Lipa, Michaela Coel and also Roger Federer.\u00a0While the show may be known for its glitzy and over-the-top red carpet - with details of what occurs inside often remaining mysterious - at its heart, it is a fundraising event for the\u00a0Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute.\u00a0Last year, the 2022 Met Gala alone raised a grand total of $17.4 million, reported Billboard.\u00a0This year the price of admission has been raised from $30,000 to $50,000, according to\u00a0Page Six.",
        "Even if you have the funds, that doesn't guarantee you entry into the party.Every guest has to be invited, and a waiting list exists for the coveted golden ticket.And status matters, according to The New York Times, meaning the hottest stars are a shoo in for an invite.\u00a0Paris Hilton was among the big names attending this year, in what was her first Met Gala.Meanwhile, Blake Lively, a frequent attendee, announced she would not be at the party.",
        "'I will be watching,' she said, according to People.Elle Fanning, Kim Kardashian and La La Anthony were among the other celebs attending.\u00a0As for Wintour's role in the bash,\u00a0Vogue's editor-in-chief organises the party and oversees the guest list and even the menu.\u00a0She has served as the Met Gala's chairwoman since 1994 and continues to serve look after look at every event.\u00a0\u00a0"
