        "George Russell has told Max Verstappen he is ready to draw a line under their X-rated row at the recent Azerbaijan Grand Prix.",
        "Verstappen called Russell a \u201cd***head\u201d following a heated confrontation after they collided on the opening lap of the sprint race.Verstappen also labelled Russell a \u201cPrincess\u201d in a subsequent interview with Dutch media.But speaking ahead of this weekend\u2019s race in Miami, Russell said: \u201cI will continue racing the same way as I always would.\u201cA lot has been said about that coming together, but from my side it was very straightforward.\u201cI went for a move, I got the move done, and moved on. Obviously he was pretty upset about it, but that is racing and these things happen. We are all here to fight. That is what F1 is all about.\u201dRussell revealed he has not spoken to Verstappen since they clashed in Baku.However, the British driver continued: \u201cThere is no air to be cleared. I will welcome, and say \u2018hello\u2019 to him if he passes by. I am sure we will shake hands when we bump into each other.",
        "\u201cFor me, it is history now and it is behind us. My views are still the same. I respect him and think he is a great driver. Things are said in the heat of the moment, but we move on.\u201dAsked about his relationship with Russell, Verstappen sarcastically said: \u201cIt is terrible\u201d, before adding: \u201cNo, it is absolutely fine.\u201d",
        "F1 is back in the Sunshine State for the second time, and the first of three races to be staged in the United States this year.A debut event on the Las Vegas strip will take place in November, while Austin\u2019s grand prix at the Circuit of the Americas has been a permanent fixture on the F1 schedule since 2012.\u201cIt is a dream for us to be in Miami and in the United States,\u201d said Lewis Hamilton.\u201cThey have the Miami Heat and the Miami Dolphins, too.\u201cThey are massive sporting fans here so to be in such an important city like Miami where sport is huge \u2013 and now Formula One is part of that \u2013 it is great to see.\u201cFor such a huge country, it is amazing that we finally have three races here. The difficult thing with Formula One is that you usually visit a country once a year. But the growth has been huge and it is such a big market for the sport.\u201dHamilton finished sixth in Azerbaijan last weekend and he is already 45 points behind championship leader Verstappen.The 38-year-old\u2019s contract with Mercedes expires at the end of the season but there are suggestions from both camps is that Hamilton will agree a new deal.",
        "Hamilton\u2019s former McLaren team-mate and 2009 world champion Jenson Button said this week that he cannot envisage his compatriot walking away from the sport.\u201cI just want to get back to the front,\u201d continued seven-time world champion Hamilton.\u201cThat is what I am working on \u2013 trying to get this team back to the front.\u201d"
