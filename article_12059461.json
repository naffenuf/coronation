        "The impressive Argentina international is keen to get his future resolved early in the window and Liverpool have had contact with his father.Mac Allister, 24, is set to be a wanted man this summer after his impressive season for Brighton as\u00a0well as his performances for Argentina in helping them win the World Cup.\u00a0Jurgen Klopp is determined to strengthen his side's midfield following an underwhelming season in which they have slipped out of the top-four.Jorg Schmadtke's expected arrival as Liverpool's new sporting director from Wolfsburg, will aid with their ambition to add three new midfielders this summer.",
        "Mac Allister put pen to paper on a new deal keeping him until 2025 in October, with speculation that the contract contains a release clause.The Athletic\u00a0have reported that the deal does have a mechanism which interested clubs could use to help grease the wheels of a move this summer.Though it is not clear what the clause is or how it may be used to facilitate a switch, knowledge of it has put several clubs on alert regarding Mac Allister's future, it is believed.It is not thought to be a simple release clause - where clubs could simply pay a certain amount and Brighton would have to accept the offer; it is reportedly a clause that allows the Seagulls more input and control over the outcome.",
        "After scoring a winning penalty for Brighton against Manchester United last week, Mac Allister said: 'I'm very happy every time I have an opportunity to score a goal, so I'm very happy for the team. It's easy to play in this team. The way we play is very nice. My team-mates are fantastic.'It's down to them as well. I'm really pleased to play with them and they help me to be a better player every day.",
        "'To be honest, after the World Cup it was a little difficult to play straight away. We didn't have the time to celebrate properly. But it is what it is.'Liverpool's need for a midfielder comes with the likes of Fabinho, Jordan Henderson and Thiago all in or approaching their 30s.Reports have suggested that James Milner will move to the Amex this summer, while Naby Keita and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain are also both expected to leave the club.The Reds have also been linked with the likes of Mac Allister's Brighton team mate Moises Caicedo, Chelsea's Mason Mount and Inter Milan's Nicolo Barella in recent weeks.\u00a0\u00a0"
