        "Jackie 'O' Henderson spent some time with her friend Bruno Bouchet on Thursday as they hit a few balls on the tennis court.",
        "The KIIS FM star, 48, donned typical sporting attire as she slipped into a loose white shirt and a black skort over bike shorts.Hiding her eyes behind a set of shades, the radio queen slicked back her golden locks into a tight pony as she rocked white sneakers and a tennis bracelet.\u00a0Jackie and Bruno, who is her radio co-host Kyle Sandilands' manager, seemed engrossed in a deep conversation before they hit the court.\u00a0However, once they picked up their racquets, the radio presenter could hardly wipe the smile off her face as she bounced around her side of the net.\u00a0",
        "The star appeared at ease despite hopping on the radio Friday morning to reveal she has a stalker somewhere in Australia.Speaking with co-host Kyle Sandilands on their KIIS FM show, they discussed Sophie Monk's recent run-in with an allegedly 'catfished' man who showed up to her house.The shock jock jokingly asked Jackie why she didn't have any stalkers, to which the radio host replied: 'Mine don't live here thankfully.'",
        "When Kyle, 51, pushed for more information, she added: 'They're in Australia but I'm not going to say [where]. No one has turned up to my house thank god.'\u00a0He then joked Jackie moves around too much for any stalker to narrow in on her location.",
        "It comes after the blonde beauty placed a winning bid on her dream home recently and moved on from her last luxury property in Woollahra.The mother of one splashed out $13.25million on a three-storey oceanfront house in Clovelly at an open auction in March.\u00a0"
