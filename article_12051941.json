Let\u2019s go change the sheets!'Jenna Bush Hager has revealed the 'gross' comment her mother, former First Lady Laura Bush, made about her bed sheets before her wedding night.\u00a0",
        "The Today host, 41, recalled the cringe-worthy moment while she and her co-star Hoda Kotb were chatting about Gwyneth Paltrow's candid interview on the Call Her Daddy podcast\u00a0in which she dished about her famous exes.\u00a0The conversation inspired them to ask each other if they ever 'kiss and tell.'\u00a0\u00a0'I try not to. But I\u2019ve been married to one person for a long time, so I don\u2019t kiss and tell about that relationship,' Bush Hager said of her husband Henry Hager.\u00a0",
        "The couple had tied the knot nearly 15 years ago at the Bush family's Prairie Chapel Ranch near Crawford, Texas, on May 10, 2008.\u00a0A photo of their wedding was then shown on the screen, prompting the former first daughter to reminisce about her big day.\u00a0\u00a0'Oh, thank you for putting up my wedding photo,' she joked. 'That was the night it all happened, y\u2019all! Just kidding.'\u00a0Bush Hager went on to share how her mother mortified her and her twin sister, Barbara Bush, with her sexual innuendo the morning of her wedding.\u00a0'My sister and I spent the night the night before [my husband and I] got married, and my mom came in [singing], \"You\u2019re getting married! Let\u2019s go change the sheets!\" And Barbara goes, \"Eww gross, mom! This isn\u2019t The Other Boleyn Girl!\"' she recalled.\u00a0",
        "'I won\u2019t even say what she said after that,' she added, laughing.\u00a0Bush Hager has never divulged when she had sex for the first time, but she recently opened up about her teenage fears that she wouldn't be able to 'save' her virginity.She had Kotb and their guest Amy Poehler\u00a0in hysterics on the morning show\u00a0when she recalled her embarrassing\u00a0diary entries.\u00a0",
        "'I had [an entry about] looking at myself in the mirror and hoping I\u2019d be able to save my virginity,' she admitted, unable to hold back her laughter.\u00a0'I was just worried in ninth grade that I wouldn\u2019t have the wherewithal to hold it, you know?' Bush Hager explained, shrugging her shoulders.\u00a0Poehler, 51, couldn't hide her amusement, joking, 'Your journals were like, \"You can do it! You can hold it.\"''What if you\u2019re not able to do it, Jenna?' the former first daughter chimed in, prompting even more laughter.\u00a0Bush Hager, who was born and raised in Texas, wrote the cringe-worthy diary entry years before her father, former President George W. Bush, took office in 2001.\u00a0",
        "'Who knows what happened,' she said, without going into further detail, 'but it was an embarrassing post to look back at.'Bush Hager went on to meet her future husband, Henry, during her father's 2004 presidential campaign.\u00a0",
        "In 2022, she detailed how Henry tried to sneak out of the White House\u00a0after spending the night with her early on in their relationship.\u00a0",
        "'My parents were traveling and I was staying there,' she explained. 'We\u2019d gone out to the bars and, like all relationships do, it reached a certain level.'Bush Hager said her future husband was in a panic the next morning.\u00a0\u00a0'Henry said he woke up and he looked around and he was, like, 'Aaaaaaaah\" because he worked for my dad,' she explained, but she wasn't bothered about her then-boyfriend leaving in his clothes from the night before.\u00a0She remembered telling him, 'Well, have fun...bye!'\u00a0'I didn't care,' she said.\u00a0\u00a0Bush Hager later elaborated on the story during an appearance on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen.\u00a0'Well, he was caught. That was the problem,' she joked. 'But as [Henry] says, [the Secret Service] are supposed to keep people from coming in. They're not looking for people that are going out, especially like a 26-year-old in the night-before clothes.\u00a0'He was caught, but their job wasn't to make sure I wasn't hooking up.'\u00a0The couple, who shares three children together, will be celebrating 15 years of marriage this month.\u00a0\u00a0"
