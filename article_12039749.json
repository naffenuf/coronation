        "Sydney is set to host more of music's biggest international acts as the annual concert cap at large stadiums is due to increase.",
        "NSW Premier Chris Minns, 43, has plans to increase the annual concert cap from four to 20 to ensure Sydney has the ability to host a wealth of global superstars.He is currently seeking regulatory approval to sign off on the move which would bring in millions of dollars into the local economy and create thousands of jobs.\u00a0'Sydney is a global city. We should be able to host global acts from around the world,' Mr Minns said in a press release.\u00a0'We need to utilise our entertainment venues to their fullest potential and show to the rest of Australia and the world that NSW is now open for business.'",
        "Increasing the concert cap to 20 is expected to lead to an extra $1.3billion in revenue for Sydney businesses over a number of years.Previously, the concert cap has meant that Venues NSW has not been able to secure several world-famous acts, including\u00a0Beyonc\u00e9, Foo Fighters and Bon Jovi.Popular international artists have the ability to bring in millions of dollars per show and prompt economic growth by creating a wealth of job opportunities for locals.Mr Minns said the current cap was costing NSW businesses between $40m - $60million per year.",
        "If things move as expected, the cap could be lifted towards the end of the year.",
        "Business Sydney Executive Director Paul Nicolaou said the move was exactly the boost Sydney needed.'Sydney needs to be a magnet for world-class artists. We know these top artists want to come to Sydney to perform so we should make it easier for them to do so,' he said."
