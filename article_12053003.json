        "Another said: 'Brilliant, made my morning- you have won twitter.'And a third added: 'Gosh this actually made me a bit emotional. So lovely , Charles would nod and smile if he saw it I'm sure.'",
        "It comes after King Charles was\u00a0accused of hiding his hands to avoid being mocked for his 'sausage fingers' in portraits released ahead of his coronation.In the new pictures, the monarch wore a simple pinstripe suit while his wife Camilla, the Queen Consort, posed in a cobalt blue dress.But members of the public realized that one detail appeared to be hidden from the photographer \u2013 the King's hands.In one shot he had them hidden behind his back as he stands alongside Camilla, 75.A second shot showed the 74-year-old with one hand in his pocket.Other food related inspirations include a pizza restaurant in Glasgow is marking the big day with their King Charlie Pizza.Sharing a post on Facebook, Villaggio Pizza wrote: 'To commemorate our new monarch we have produced our King Charlie Pizza.'It's a one-off and not available to order, unfortunately, but we do have all our usual great food.'",

        "It appears to have taken inspiration from the monarch's love of gardening, and features spinach, broad beans and tarragon.The\u00a0'Coronation Quiche' was developed in close conjunction with the King and Queen Consort by the Royal Chef Mark Flanagan, at Buckingham Palace.\u00a0Flanagan has been in charge of royal meals since 2002. It is hoped people will be inspired to make the quiche and serve it up at the 'Big Lunches' being held in communities up and down the country over the Coronation weekend of May 6-8.Quiche was chosen because it is considered a good 'sharing' dish to take to a street party and can be served hot or cold.\u00a0",
        "It also suits a wide variety of dietary requirements and preferences and is considered to be 'not too complicated to make or require costly or hard-to-source ingredients'."
