I\u2019ll never get rid of these, I had multiple panic attacks on Saturday evening.\u00a0'I went out for a few beers on the Friday, I always feel anxious after drinking but I\u2019d really hammered it after a long time of not boozing and my mum had to come down to calm me down, lie in bed with me and I was having panic attack after panic attack and the whole week after I felt off.'\u00a0But the hitmaker added that he's been having a better week as he deals with the ups and downs of his mental health.\u00a0",
        "He added: 'I\u2019m having a good day today I haven\u2019t twitched that much, I still do that I still tick quite a lot but it\u2019s one of these things.\u00a0'What\u2019s mad is that there is no real treatment for Tourette\u2019s so I\u2019m in a position where I can cancel a whole day of work if I\u2019m too stressed or my anxiety it too bad.\u00a0'For other people it must be so much worse, they don\u2019t have the luxury I have.'",
