        "INDIANAPOLIS (AP) - The Indianapolis Colts want other NFL teams to know they consider contacting former quarterback Andrew Luck or his representatives to be tampering.",
        "Team owner Jim Irsay made it clear in a Twitter post late Sunday night following a weekend report from ESPN that the Washington Commanders attempted to find out in 2022 whether the four-time Pro Bowler would consider making a comeback.Luck retired abruptly in August 2019 at age 29 with three years left on his contract. Irsay even allowed Luck to keep the full $24.8 million in bonus money instead of trying to collect some of that money.So Irsay responded with a warning.\"If any NFL Team attempted to contact Andrew Luck (or any associate of him)... to play for their Franchise - it would be a clear Violation of the League\u00b4s Tampering Policy,\" Irsay wrote.A message left by The Associated Press seeking comment from the NFL was not immediately returned.",
        "Luck has shown no indication he wants to play again and when he returned to Lucas Oil Stadium for the college football championship game in early 2022, the No. 1 overall draft pick in 2012 appeared to have slimmed down significantly from his playing weight of 240 pounds.He's shown no interest in making a comeback even as the Colts spent years searching for Luck's replacement.Whomever starts this year's season opener will be the seventh different starter in seven years for Indy.",
        "The report came less than two weeks after Indy drafted former Florida star Anthony Richardson with the No. 4 overall pick, hopeful he'll be the new franchise quarterback.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL"
