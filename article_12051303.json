        "The Princess of Wales showed off her charm with the crowds in London today\u00a0Do you know Debbie Hoover's aunt? Let us know Paul.Farrell@mailonline.com\u00a0\u00a0READ MORE: Mirroring Meghan! Kate wears her sister-in-law's signature \u00a3490 Aquazzura heels with monochrome dress to Coronation receptionThe Princess of Wales showed off her easy charm with the public today as she posed for selfies with thrilled royal fans at The Mall - and even enjoyed a phone call with one admirer.\u00a0",
        "Kate, 41, joined the King, 74, and the Prince of Wales, 40, during a\u00a0surprise appearance in London to greet well-wishers less than 24 hours before the coronation.The road leading to Buckingham Palace was cleared and royal fans eagerly lined the route, having likely figured out that they may well catch a glimpse of the royals due to the security and media presence.Kate eagerly posed for selfies with fans, while the mother-of-three even appeared to join one person in a video call before also speaking on another fan's phone before handing it back.The royal chatted on the phone to Texan Debbie Hoover's aunt, who was in\u00a0Tennessee with a broken leg, which meant she couldn't fly out with her family for the coronation, according to\u00a0BBC journalist\u00a0Chi Chi Izundu on Twitter.\u00a0",
        "'Are you feeling OK?', asks Kate, before adding: 'Come and say hi Julie when you're back over here but I hope you get better soon.'People cheered and could be heard shouting 'God Save the King' as the senior figures of the monarchy arrived to shake hands with well-wishers.Royal superfans were left blown away by the visit, which came just hours after a downpour soaked thousands of people camped out at The Mall, with one person telling Sky News: 'This is the happiest moment in my life.'",
        "The King went to one side of The Mall while William and Kate went to another to greet well-wishers. One woman told Charles 'Love you Charlie' while others passed on their congratulations to him.Meanwhile, alongside Kate, a beaming William also posed for selfies with the adoring crowd.Although there is no official protocol on selfies, the royals have a rule against signing autographs, so that they can't be sold for large amounts of money.And in the early days of camera phones, they seemed to shy away from being snapped with members of the public with Princes William and Harry and King Charles all voicing their dislike of the method.However, in recent years, they've become commonplace, with Charles posing for his first selfie all the way back in 2014, and other royals from Sophie Wessex to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle following suit.The late Queen Elizabeth II was not a fan of selfies and would politely decline if ever asked to take one, as she was thought to prefer eye contact. However, this was more of a personal preference than a rule of any kind.",
        "William has previously joked that he is 'allergic to selfies' while Harry once told a teenager that 'selfies are bad' and told her to 'just take a normal photograph' when she requested one in Australia in 2015.",
        "However in recent times it appears some royals have grown fonder of the selfie, perhaps viewing the form of photography as way of embracing modern times and connecting with fans.Despite previously admitting he 'hates' selfies, the King was among the first royals to be seen stopping for a snap with fans after cheeky scaffolder Sam Wayne took a picture with him in 2014.Two years later the same construction worker, from Redruth, reduced, Kate, then the Duchess of Cambridge, to fits of giggles as he snapped a selfie with them on a tour of a housing development in Cornwall.Prince William pushed the trend further in 2014 when he actually took the picture himself while posing for a snap with a schoolgirl after she visited the Sandringham Estate on Christmas Day.The Duke ended up photographing himself with the schoolgirl, Madison Lambe, 12, because she was too nervous to press the button on her phone.William seems to have grown more accustomed to the selfie over the years, with the royal melting hearts when he put his tour of Ireland on hold to stop for a selfie with little girl Jennifer Malone in March 2020.Kate has always seemed to be comfortable with the selfie, going viral in 2014 when she took a snap high-fiving a youngster in Christchurch before posing with various well-wishers on a walkabout in Sydney.",
        "Meanwhile, Prince Harry welcomed the selfie after marrying Meghan Markle in 2018 when the pair happily posed for several photos with royal supporters during their 16-day tour of Australia, Fiji, Tonga and New Zealand.It also seems that Queen Consort Camilla has always been on board with the selfie, having posed with various fans over the years.In June 2016, she proved she's a good sport by snapping a selfie with staff member Biffy Mackay, 27, at the Social Bite cafe in Edinburgh, which feeds, trains and employs members of the homeless community.",
        "Sophie Wessex has also been spotted indulging fans who asked for a selfie when she smiled with a group of youngsters while previously attending the New Forest and Hampshire County Show.As royal selfies appear to become more commonplace, fans may consider the practice a sign of a monarchy that is becoming more modern, as King Charles takes the reins.Earlier, the King took part a final coronation rehearsal at Westminster Abbey, where a 2,300-strong congregation, and a television audience likely to be in the tens of millions, will watch him being crowned on Saturday.\u00a0As excitement ramps for Britain's first coronation in 70 years, Charles and Kate joined a lunch for VIPs at Buckingham Palace.His Majesty was joined by working royals at a special event for prime ministers and governors general at the Palace from midday, just after the heavens opened on London.",
        "The Prince and Princess of Wales, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh, the Princess Royal and Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence were at the event. Completing the royal contingent were the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester and the Duke of Kent. But there was no invite for Prince Andrew, who was seen driving around Windsor this lunchtime.\u00a0There were 42 attendees in total, including UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, Australia's republican Prime Minister\u00a0Anthony Albanese, and Prime Minister of New Zealand Chris Hipkins.\u00a0"
