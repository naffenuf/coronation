Lewis waved his arms in the air while in mid discussion with Lottie - who he began dating in 2020.When approached for comment, Lottie's representatives told MailOnline: 'There were no tense conversations and they are happy.' The pair took a night off from parenting duties to celebrate Lottie's sister Daisy Tomlinson's birthday.",

        "'Not all of Caroline's friends are happy with how the situation appears to be developing but can understand that both Lottie and Lewis have been there for each other as a shoulder to cry on.'",
        "Caroline died by suicide in her London home at the age of 40, days before she was due to face trial for assaulting Lewis, with whom she had been in a relationship for just over six months.The star was arrested in December for assault and charged with attacking the model at her home in Islington. Lewis dropped his assault complaint against Caroline yet prosecutors pursued the case and the couple was told not to have any contact.It was confirmed following the inquest that Caroline took her own life after hearing she would definitely be prosecuted for assaulting her boyfriend, a coroner ruled."
