        "England seamer Ollie Robinson is enjoying being in the same dressing room as Steve Smith and doubts the former Australia captain\u2019s presence at Sussex will have a material impact on the Ashes.",
        "Smith linking up with Sussex for three Division Two matches in the LV= Insurance County Championship gives him a chance to get to grips with English conditions ahead of Australia\u2019s bid to retain the urn this summer.The union between player and county has divided opinion but Smith did not play any championship matches before the 2019 Ashes and still amassed 774 runs at a titanic 110.54 average in a drawn 2-2 series.",
        "Earlier this week, he confessed he was welcomed to the Sussex nets by having his stumps rearranged by Robinson, who sees the advantages in playing alongside Smith and Sussex and India\u2019s Cheteshwar Pujara.\u201cIt\u2019s a good battle,\u201d said Robinson. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to bowl at him and Pujara, I think it ups my game when I am training as well, it\u2019s great to have them batting at the other end.\u201c(Smith) is obviously a very good player and I think he will score runs regardless of whether he faces me or not.\u201cWe get a look at each other, but I don\u2019t think it makes a big difference in the grand scheme of things.\u201cTo have the world\u2019s best batsman and Pujara in the same changing room has been cool. It hasn\u2019t felt weird, I know (Smith) from previous series and it\u2019s nice to have him around.\u201d",
        " I'm trying to peak for the Ashes, trying to get as many overs as possible between now and then  Ollie Robinson  Smith was restricted to a watching brief on the opening day of his championship debut at New Road, where Robinson hogged the limelight with seven for 59 as Worcestershire were all out for 264.Robinson was a constant menace, bowling with vigour and at good pace, and only when he was taken out of the firing line did Worcestershire\u2019s batters find any kind of rhythm at the crease.This was only Robinson\u2019s second outing of the season after experiencing some soreness in his back shortly after his return from New Zealand at the end of England\u2019s winter touring programme in February.The issue was not a major concern for Robinson but with the eagerly-anticipated five-Test series against Australia starting next month, he elected to have a pain-killing injection in the area.\u201cIt\u2019s similar to the one I had last year,\u201d said Robinson, who struggled with a back problem during the 2021-22 Ashes. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a spasm, just the joint was getting slightly irritated.\u201cLast summer I let it go on and on, it took until June to be playing again. This year I thought I\u2019d get it done as soon as possible and nip it in the bud.",
        "\u201cI don\u2019t know many bowlers that don\u2019t get jabs every year. It\u2019s one of those things. I wanted to get on top of it before the Ashes, it feels really good now.\u201dRobinson\u2019s contribution put Sussex in the driving seat \u2013 they closed on 63 for one before bad light brought an early end to the day \u2013 and, at this stage, he plans to play in the south coast club\u2019s matches against Leicestershire and Glamorgan before linking up with England.\u201cI\u2019m trying to peak for the Ashes, trying to get as many overs as possible between now and then,\u201d added Robinson. \u201cThree Sussex games and then the Ireland Test.\u201cI\u2019m about 80 per cent, I\u2019d say, there was a little bit of rustiness there, didn\u2019t quite get my lengths right early on. But the wicket is quite helpful so when I did get it in the right area, they nicked it.\u201d"
