        "Chris Wilder admitted that Watford\u2019s 2-0 win over Stoke was only a small crumb of comfort after his immensely disappointing season.",
        "The Hornets boss, who was sacked by Middlesbrough last October, refused to discuss his future at Vicarage Road, with the rumour mill rife that he is about to be replaced.Imran Louza and Keinan Davis scored second-half goals to ensure Wilder\u2019s side at least ended the campaign with a top-half finish.Louza\u2019s brilliant 20-yard curler broke Stoke\u2019s resistance after 70 minutes and Villa loanee Davis\u2019 deflected shot beat Matija Sarkic four minutes later.Wilder said: \u201cThe message to the players was that there is always something to play for. There\u2019s always somebody watching, there\u2019s always that pride in pulling that shirt on, whether as an individual or as a team.\u201cFrom my point of view it could have been a really disappointing afternoon. The atmosphere might have turned one way but it didn\u2019t because we\u2019ve got a result.",
        "\u201cThe supporters want to see a winning team and they\u2019ve seen a winning team today, even all three results could have happened.\u201cWe had some good moments first half and they had some good moments first half. But in the second half we get the goals in quick succession and then it\u2019s a comfortable afternoon.\u201cTo get a small consolation out of a deeply disappointing season is a small positive. But it was disappointing when we\u2019re walking around (on the lap of appreciation) because this shouldn\u2019t have been the end of the season. But it is and there\u2019s a reason behind that.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s been a strange old season, personally. It\u2019s been quite tough. I\u2019ve had a relatively successful career as a manager in terms of being involved in winning sides and building teams and personal accolades as well.\u201cYou\u2019ve got to take the rough with the smooth. I\u2019m a better manager for all these experiences, I haven\u2019t gone off the boil.\u201cI\u2019m just concentrating on this win today, anything else going forwards will be a conversation, I\u2019ve not sat down with anybody, I don\u2019t want to go into gut feelings.\u201dStoke boss Alex Neil looked relieved to wrap up a poor campaign from the Potters, especially as his former club Sunderland, who he left last August, clinched a play-off spot.Neil said: \u201cMy verdict is that game pretty much sums up our season.\u201cI don\u2019t think it was a poor performance. I thought in the first half we were really good at times, we created some really good chances. But, ultimately, if you don\u2019t stick the ball in the net and then you can\u2019t defend in moments, because that was all Watford had in the second half, moments.\u201cTheir first goal was quite a good goal. Their boy cuts in and puts it in the far corner. Their second goal was just a one-v-one situation where we just don\u2019t deal with it and the ball ends up in the back of our net.",
        "\u201cBut we had three or four similar opportunities and we don\u2019t manage to convert any of them. That\u2019s basically the tale of our season for me. This season, at both ends of the pitch, we haven\u2019t been good enough.\u201cToday wasn\u2019t ever going to change anything. What\u2019s been needed has been needed for a number of weeks.\u201cI feel as if I\u2019m doing the same press conference week after week. It\u2019s going to be a big summer for the club.\u201cI\u2019ve got meetings (with the players) over the next week. Loan players we\u2019re not in control of because ultimately they\u2019re not our player.\u201cWe\u2019ll need to see what happens over the summer, but the difficulty is that we\u2019ve got urgency, but that urgency needs to be shared by the opposite club. So it\u2019s going to be difficult to get anything done.\u201d"
