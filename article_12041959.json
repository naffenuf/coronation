        "'He is on his way, he is a strong character and that's why he's there in the moment on this level, and he did it by himself.'Now more work is coming to go because the demands are higher. We expect more from him but it's great he made it.\u00a0'It tells we will give young players opportunities but they have to deserve it. When I say give, translate to deserve.\u00a0'They have to deserve with their feet, show it on the pitch and it means investing a lot, investing in training and performances in the Under-21s then wait for your moment and prove again.'Alejandro is that step beyond but now the demands will be even more. He has to compete for a starting XI position.\u00a0",
        "'Every time is the same: you have to cross limits and every time you have to go in the next level.\u00a0'We go with him in the challenge but most important is the player has to do it.'"
