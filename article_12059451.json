        "The 24-year-old USA international is one of several players the West London club are looking to sell this summer before his contract runs down and he is desperate to play more regularly.He has made just eight league starts for the Blues this season and scored one goal across all competitions.\u00a0Napoli's interest could add extra spice as Chelsea want their star striker Victor Osimhen.\u00a0",
        "The Serie A champions are insisting publicly that the Nigerian is not for sale but the general consensus, at least between Chelsea and Manchester united, is that he is for around \u00a3130million.\u00a0That figure is already too high for Bayern Munich, who are concentrating on Randal Kolo Muani from Eintracht Frankfurt, and it will be a problem for Chelsea under scrutiny of Financial Fair play.\u00a0They will look at who could be put into an offer for Osimhen with Romelu Lukaku, due back from Inter this summer, another one to consider.Chelsea have discussed signing Inter Milan's Andre Onana though he is not thought to be the goalkeeper favoured by Mauricio Pochettino, who is expected to be confirmed as the club's next manager this week."
