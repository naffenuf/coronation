They've never asked me to go back in again, not once, mate!'When asked about how things ended for his character, the actor added: '(It was) the worst outro ever... I didn't even leave at the end of the episode.'You know you leave and you get the \"duff duff\"? Mine, I went to Norwich to be a bellboy at a hotel and mid-scene just walked in The Vic, went, \"See you later\", turned back to Phil, come to me and I'd gone.'What? That was it? No \"duff duff\". I was there five years and not one \"duff duff\"!'I'm A Celebrity... South Africa continues at 9pm on ITV1 and ITVX on Monday."
