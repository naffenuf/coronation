        "HOUSTON (AP) - San Francisco's Anthony DeSclafani threw a season-high 109 pitches in eight scoreless innings of a win over the Houston Astros on Tuesday.",
        "Hard work for sure, but from Houston manager Dusty Baker's vantage point the right-hander made it look easy.\"It looked like he didn't even break a sweat,\" Baker said. \"He was very good tonight.\"Camilo Doval completed the three-hitter after DeSclafani left to help the Giants to the 2-0 victory.Blake Sabol had an RBI double and Thairo Estrada added two hits to help San Francisco snap a four-game skid.After the winning the series opener 7-3, the Astros couldn\u00b4t get anything going against DeSclafani as they were shut out for the first time this season.",
        "\"DeSclafani was attacking everybody,\" San Francisco manager Gabe Kapler said. \"It was just first pitch strike after first pitch strike ... incredibly efficient. We needed that. It was big for the club. A big morale boost for sure.\"DeSclafani (3-1) had retired 11 in a row after a double by Yanier Diaz with one out in the third before Yordan Alvarez doubled with one out in the seventh.But he was left stranded when DeSclafani retired Jos\u00e9 Abreu and Kyle Tucker to end the inning.He gave up an infield single to Diaz with two outs in the eighth and he reached second on an error by the pitcher on the play. Jake Meyers grounded out to end the threat.",
        "He struck out three without a walk to lower his ERA to 2.13.\"I knew some guys weren\u00b4t feeling good and it\u00b4s been a long road trip,\" DeSclafani said. \"I wanted to go deep regardless, but I think it\u00b4s a plus with some guys not feeling good.\"Doval struck out one in a hitless ninth to get his fourth save.The retractable roof at Minute Maid Park was open for the first time this season with Houston experiencing unseasonably cool temperatures in the mid-70s. The roof is rarely open because it\u00b4s so hot, and it was open just once all last season.Houston rookie Hunter Brown (3-1) yielded four hits and two runs while walking a career-high five batters for the loss.He lasted just 4 1/3 innings, further taxing a bullpen that had to pitch almost the entire game Monday night after starter Luis Garc\u00eda left with an elbow injury after just eight pitches.Garc\u00eda was placed on the 15-day injured list Tuesday with elbow discomfort, joining fellow starter Jos\u00e9 Urquidy, who went on the list Monday after injuring his shoulder Sunday night.Estrada got things going for the Giants when he singled with one out in the first and stole second base. They took an early lead when he scored on a single by Joc Pederson.",
        "Estrada singled again to start the third but was caught trying to steal second base. Brown then walked Pederson and Michael Conforto before Pederson scored on a two-out double by Sabol that bounced off the wall in left field and made it 2-0.Brown walked Cal Stevenson to start the fifth before being lifted after walking Estrada with one out. Matt Gage, who was recalled from Triple-A Sugar Land to take Garc\u00eda\u00b4s roster spot, took over and was greeted by a single from Conforto. But Wilmer Flores grounded out to allow Gage to escape the bases-loaded jam.The Giants loaded the bases with one out in the eighth inning, but were unable to add to the lead when Pederson grounded into a double play.TRAINER\u00b4S ROOMGiants: OF Darin Ruf (right wrist inflammation) started a rehabilitation assignment with Triple-A Sacramento on Tuesday.Astros: 2B Jose Altuve took ground balls Tuesday for the first time since fracturing his thumb in the World Baseball Classic. Manager Dusty Baker said it was a good first step but that there isn\u00b4t a timetable for when he could return.\"The doctor said that he\u00b4s done good,\" Baker said. \"He\u00b4s done very well. He took ground balls, which is a big plus, and the next step is just to see how he feels and try to keep him on schedule.\"",
        "ESTRADA'S HOT STARTEstrada, who has a hit in 15 of his last 18 games, is off to a hot start. He is fourth in the majors with a .342 batting average, ranks eighth with 38 hits and is tied for 10th with nine stolen bases.\"Everything I did during the offseason has worked out,\" he said in Spanish through a translator. \"The great start I\u00b4ve had is due to what I did during the offseason. I just hope to continue it and keep it up.\"UP NEXTSan Francisco\u00b4s Logan Webb (1-5, 4.10 ERA) opposes Framber Valdez (2-3, 2.54) when the series wraps up Wednesday.___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"
