        "According to star striker Paul Mullin, Reynolds and McElhenney will fund a trip for its players to Las Vegas after securing promotion to the English Football League.Mullin told the Footballers' Football podcast that the players were going to be boarding a flight to Las Vegas soon after the open-top bus parade through Wrexham.'I don't know if I can say it yet but we're off to Vegas,' Mullin said. 'It should be unbelievable, that's literally what they were texting me about two minutes ago. I don't think she is too happy about it,' Mullin said speaking about his partner.'But if the owners tell you you've got to go, you've got to go. I don't really want to go either, I'm devastated,' he sarcastically joked.Wrexham's top scorer - 46 goals in all competitions - also described the unique reality of having two globally-known actors as owners.'It's mental, it's absolutely mental,' he said. 'You get used to it in the end but from the start until now, every week something mad happens.'One day you're training like normal and you go back in the changing room and Will Ferrell is sat there, what are you meant to do?''Just normal lads from around the block and A-listers turn up every week. They're sound guys Rob and Ryan and it's unbelievable.",
        "'Honestly, you'll be at training one day and then they'll turn up and sit down with the lads and have dinner, they're so accessible. Two seconds before I got on the phone they were both messaging me.'It's just mental how accessible they are, so open as people and so genuine, they make you feel that comfortable you can text them about anything, ask for help, they're always willing to help.'When they come over they can't wait to come in the changing room, they're like two schoolboys or like me when I was a kid wanting to meet the Liverpool players.'\u00a0"
