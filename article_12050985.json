        "Tottenham captain Hugo Lloris will not play again this season due to a thigh injury.",
        "Lloris has not featured since he was replaced at half-time of Tottenham\u2019s 6-1 thrashing at Newcastle and there are now doubts over whether he will play for the club again given his uncertain future with only one year left on his deal.\u201cHugo\u2019s out for the season,\u201d Spurs\u2019 acting head coach Ryan Mason confirmed ahead of Saturday\u2019s visit of Crystal Palace.",
        "\u201cWe had the results back. Obviously disappointing, but we kind of feared that initially. We did some more tests and he won\u2019t play for us again this season.\u201cI can\u2019t speak about next season but what I can say is that he has a very important role for us until the end of the season. We need him. We need him to be part of the group and I\u2019m sure he will be.\u201dLloris is alongside Emerson Royal (ankle), Ryan Sessegnon (hamstring), Yves Bissouma (ankle) and Rodrigo Bentancur (knee) on the treatment table.",
        "Mason provided a positive update on Emerson and Bissouma but Sessegnon will not play again this season while Bentancur is set for a long spell on the sidelines as he recovers from anterior cruciate ligament damage.On Bissouma, Mason said: \u201cThere are obviously some hurdles he has got to overcome and to hit some certain goals but we are hopeful he will appear before the end of the season.",
        "\u201cRyan had a significant injury, he\u2019s been out for a long time so Ryan won\u2019t feature again this season.\u201cEmerson, I think it is a day-to-day check on how he is and how he\u2019s coping. Hopefully Emerson can help us between now and end of the season.\u201d",
        "When Emerson does return to full fitness, it will increase the likelihood of Spurs reverting to a back four, which Mason used during his previous tenure in caretaker charge.He hinted on Friday that a tactical switch could occur before Palace visit and also started his press conference with a congratulations message to the club\u2019s under-18s.Stuart Lewis\u2019 side won 3-1 at Aston Villa to clinch the Under-18 Premier League Cup on Thursday night, having also sealed the Under-17 League Cup last month.Academy graduate Mason is hopeful some of them can progress into the first-team.",
        "\u201cI\u2019d just like to congratulate our under-18s from our academy because they won the under-18s Premier League Cup last night. Backed the under-17s up. It\u2019s important and good for the football club,\u201d Mason added.\u201cFirst of all you have to be good enough. That\u2019s a challenge to any of our academy players.\u201cIt is a big step up to the first team and we want them to aspire to that. We need academy players.",
        "\u201cWe\u2019ve got Harry Kane, we\u2019ve got (Oliver) Skippy, we\u2019ve got others in the squad that are helping. I understand and the club certainly understand the value in that.\u201dMason also paid tribute to \u201camazing\u201d Crystal Palace boss Roy Hodgson, who gave him his solitary England cap in 2015.\u201cI will obviously always have a soft spot for Roy Hodgson because he gave me my England debut,\u201d he said of the 75-year-old.\u201cI think the most important thing in football is if you have the fire inside you and if you can influence players and he\u2019s definitely got that still.\u201d"
