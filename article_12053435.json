        "Named after owner Birley's grandfather, it is a club for both men and women - with a focus on wine.",
        "The private members' club is thought to be the best for wine connoisseurs, where guests can either cellar their own wine, or buy in house, before enjoying them in the ground floor restaurant or on the small rear terrace.Zara, 41, who arrived at Oswald's alongside her husband Mike, 44, opted for a striking navy blazer and trouser combo, paired with a light blue shirt.Her cousin, Princess Eugenie, 33, who is expecting her second child with husband Jack Brooksbank, who was also in attendance at the family occasion, seemingly took inspiration from Zara and donned an Asceno Velvet Athens Robe, costing \u00a3575.They were joined alongside Princess Beatrice , 34, dressed in Louis Vuitton's \u00a32,900 chain print asymmetrical long-sleeved frock.Today, they will join King Charles, Queen Camilla and the Prince and Princess of Wales at the coronation in Westminster Abbey. The King, Kate and William attended a Buckingham Palace reception yesterday with foreign royals and world leaders.Eugenie, who already shares two-year-old August with her husband Jack, paired her glamorous red robe with black heels and a matching bag.Coordinating with his wife, Jack opted for a smart suit, white crisp shirt and a red patterned tie.",

        "Joining costs \u00a31,800 a year and members - rumoured to include Harry Styles, Margot Robbie, Mick Jagger and numerous royals - need to be recommended by a proposer and a seconder.In the summer of 2020 following lockdown, Mr Birley, who is known as the 'king of clubs' spent millions of his own money to lure members back to his fashionable Mayfair nightspots.",
        "The mogul gifted every member of 5 Hertford Street and Oswald's a free meal up to the value of \u00a3500 - an offer which lasted until Christmas, with members allowed to bring as many guests as they like.There are understood to be at least 3,000 members of the two clubs so it could have set Birley back more than \u00a31.5million.Birley, the son of Lady Annabel Goldsmith and late club owner Mark Birley, opened 5 Hertford Street in 2012 and it soon became London's most exclusive watering hole.Based in a labyrinthine townhouse, it is decorated like a bohemian stately home and members are charged fees of about \u00a32,500 a year.Birley bears facial scars left by a tiger that attacked him at a family friends' private zoo when he was just 12.And the businessman made headlines in 2019 after it was claimed that he helped to fund Boris Johnson's campaign to become prime minister."
