        "Glastonbury is set to be taken by storm after five 90s legends formed their own supergroup Mantra of the Cosmos.\u00a0",
        "Ringo Starr's son, and The Who drummer, Zak Starkey, 57, has joined forces with\u00a0Oasis bassist Andy Bell, 52,\u00a0as well as Happy Mondays' Shaun Ryder, 60, and Bez, 59.\u00a0With Shaun telling The Sun: 'We've been making a new album for BMG. It's a bit of a mixture of all us lot together'.'It doesn't sound like the [happy] Mondays or [his current band] Black Grape, or Oasis or The Who, it's what we are doing all together'.Before adding: 'It's coming out very soon. we're doing Glastonbury with Manta of the Cosmos this year, It's coming out pretty soon'.\u00a0",
        "MailOnline have contacted the musician's reps for comment.\u00a0\u00a0In March\u00a0Lana Del Rey\u00a0implied she could pull out of Glastonbury after the festival's line-up announcement.The singer, 37, is one of the acts that was revealed to be part of the line-up was displeased about how she was announced.Arctic Monkeys and Guns N\u2019 Roses were announced as the final two headliners, joining Sir\u00a0Elton John\u00a0at the top of the bill.\u00a0But Lana pointed out that she would be playing top billing on the Other Stage, which Glastonbury failed to mention.She also appeared all the way down the poster with more than 20 names of other acts listed before her.Lana showed her annoyance, by commenting on the\u00a0official Glastonbury post on Instagram, writing: 'Thanks for announcing that I was headlining the other stage. Thumbs up.'",
        "According to reports, she also took to her own private Instagram to share the poster and add: 'Well, I\u2019m actually headlining the 2nd stage.'Then hinting she may be pulling out, she said: 'But since there was no consideration for announcing that we\u2019ll see.'",
        "Her fans took her side and commented on Glastonbury's post asking why Lana hadn't been listed higher.One said: 'Why Lana isn\u2019t in the top row? Wtf'.While another echoed: 'Why isn\u2019t Lana headlining the main stage.'And a third agreed, writing: 'Imagine not mentioning Lana in the caption she\u2019s the biggest of all headliners'.\u00a0It comes after Glastonbury Festival organiser Emily Eavis has spoken out in defence of the 'boring' line-up of all male acts.The line-up includes Lizzo, Lewis Capaldi, The War On Drugs, Christine And The Queens, Thundercat, Lil Nas X, Carly Rae Jepsen and Manic Street Preachers.\u00a0Yet fans were quick to remark at the lack of female talent booked.Out of the 30 headline acts announced since 2010 only four have been women -\u00a0Beyonce, Adele, Billie Eilish, Florence and the Machine - with Emily claiming it's due to a 'problem in the pipeline.'\u00a0",
        "She told The Guardian: 'We\u2019re trying our best so the pipeline needs to be developed. This starts way back with the record companies, radio. I can shout as loud as I like but we need to get everyone on board.'\u00a0",
        "She added that they remain 'entirely focused on balancing our bill. It\u2019s not just about gender, it\u2019s about every aspect of diversity.'\u00a0Emily went on to commit to having two female headliners next year and said Lizzo - who will perform just before Guns N' Roses - would have been booked to headline this year but the positions had already been locked in by the male acts.\u00a0Yet fans were unimpressed, taking to Twitter to share: '@glastonbury do better!!! All male headliners? You can\u2019t even blame lack of talent, there is a overwhelming WEALTH of amazing women to choose from';\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Always brilliant but that\u2019s not the best line up. Elton should be Saturday night. Would be great to see ACDC headline one year. Eminem. Madonna. Phil Collins for the legend slot.'; 'Absolutely shocking compared to other years';",
        "'@glastonbury @ArcticMonkeys and @gunsnroses Worst Glastonbury line up in years if ever'; 'Situations like this year's Glastonbury lineup are a direct symptom of industry failures to support female artists from the ground up. Getting them on the smaller stages, on radio, at live venues.''No guys you don't understand,\u00a0Glastonbury HAD to book Guns N Roses to headline a festival in 2023 because there are simply no women whatsoever in music'; 'During Women's History Month, Glastonbury Festival announced an all-male headline bill. In 2023. Tell me why we don't need this month one more time.';",
        "'Stormzy wasn't at big festival headliner status when he did Glastonbury and look what he did with the platform. Seems unusually backwards to not allow that same opportunity to literally any women.'; 'Just a bit boring';'During Women's History Month, Glastonbury Festival announced an all-male headline bill. In 2023. Tell me why we don't need this month one more time.'\u00a0",
        "Glastonbury 2023: Is the festival sold out? When's the ticket resale?\u00a0Here's EVERYTHING you need to know about getting a wristband - after final two headliners announced."
