        "A firefighter who was part of a convoy of fire engines and lorries delivering life-saving equipment for Ukraine has described the experience as \u201cvery humbling\u201d after reaching Poland.",
        "The timing of the shipment is meant to honour the Eurovision link between Ukraine and the UK, with the vehicles leaving Liverpool on Tuesday, the city which will host the competition later this month.Darren Cleaves, station manager for South Wales Fire and Rescue Service, was in Poland to help deliver fire engines as well as life-saving equipment for Ukrainian firefighters.\u201cIt\u2019s been a very humbling experience because knowing that the small difference we can make to help (firefighters in Ukraine) is really rewarding for us,\u201d the 48-year-old from Monmonth told the PA News agency.",
        "\u201cIt has been quite challenging \u2013 the logistics behind it in terms of keeping our team of over 80 people fed, watered, truck refuelled, and dealing with maintenance issues, but we\u2019ve managed to overcome all of those.\u201dMr Cleaves is part of the biggest party of the convoy with 24 drivers from South Wales Fire and Rescue Service. They delivered fire vehicles and vital equipment for firefighters in Ukraine, arriving in Poland on Friday after making the three-day journey from Liverpool.The convoy of fire engines and large lorries carrying equipment has hardly stopped during the course of its mammoth journey to ensure that the equipment is delivered as quickly as possible.\u201cWe\u2019ve got a high number of drivers with good rotation, so we\u2019ve managed to keep the vehicles moving and stopping at the end of every evening, only for a couple of hours asleep,\u201d Mr Cleaves explained.",
        "\u201cOn behalf of the convoy, everyone is very humbled and overwhelmed by the whole experience and I\u2019m proud to be part of this small aid effort in helping Ukrainian firefighters.\u201dPhil Garrigan, vice chair of the National Fire Chiefs Council (NFCC) and chief fire officer for Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service, said he is \u201cvery proud\u201d of the 87 volunteers who made the lengthy trip to deliver thousands of items of equipment to Ukraine.Speaking from Poland, the 53-year-old said his team can feel \u201cthe pride of being able to contribute\u201d and provide aid for the country.\u201cWhen you\u2019re in the throes of war or you\u2019re struggling, it\u2019s nice to know that you\u2019ve got people outside your own country who support you and are here for you,\u201d he told PA.\u201cIt\u2019s very much about the fire and rescue service family looking after the (Ukrainian) fire and rescue service family, knowing that they\u2019ve got a role to play serving their community.\u201cWe\u2019re doing that to the best of our ability and we\u2019ve got people who are so passionate, so I think they should all be applauded for that and I\u2019m very proud of them.\u201d",
        "The donations take contributions by England and Wales\u2019 fire services to support Ukraine to 87 fire and rescue vehicles and more than 100,000 items of equipment.",
        "Mr Garrigan, who has been part of five convoys delivering fire equipment to Ukraine, spoke of the tragic losses of Ukrainian firefighters. He has liaised with Ukrainian ministers about future support that the UK fire and rescue services can offer.\u201cAs of today, 270 fire stations have been destroyed, about 1,500 fire engines have been destroyed, and 68 firefighters have been killed,\u201d he said.\u201c(A further) 250 firefighters have been injured and five could be in captivity, so you can understand why the UK Fire Rescue Service would want to support.\u201d"
