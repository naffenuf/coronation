        "Federal Budget will be delivered by Labor on Tuesday\u00a0Treasurer Jim Chalmers answered question from renter\u00a0Treasurer Jim Chalmers has slammed a $150 a week rent increase dumped onto a single mother by her landlord as 'ridiculous'.",
        "Dr Chalmers was filling in for Scott Pape, better known as the Barefoot Investor, on his financial advice column this week ahead of the Federal Budget being handed down on Tuesday.\u00a0'I'm a single mum with two kids, two cats and a dog and I'm really struggling,' the woman named Emma explained.'My landlord just let me know he will be increasing the rent by $150 a week, due to the 'changes in the housing market'. How will I survive?'\u00a0She added that she has just gotten a new job but will lose her Family Tax Benefit because she is going from four days a week to five days.",
        "Also, she said despite the fact she will soon be earning $100,000 a year, she is already finding it hard to support her family and will probably have to pay more for after-school-care fees due to her higher income.'It's just me paying for everything, what should I do?' she said.Dr Chalmers didn't pull any punches in his response, saying: '$150 a week is ridiculous'.\u00a0He suggested a hike by that much was a grab for cash using the rental market as an excuse.'It's worth talking to your local tenants union to find out what your options are,' he said.",
        "'The options will differ depending on what state you're in but could include reporting excessive increases to a relevant state body.''We recognise rent's a big part of the pressure people are feeling right now.'He said his Labor government was attempting to get the parliament to agree to building more properties.'We've got some tax breaks coming so that investors build more homes and besides that we are making your after school care cheaper from July 1, by increasing the subsidy.'",
        "Separately on Monday, the government announced that from September 20 single parents will no longer have to transfer to JobSeeker when their youngest child turns eight.A base rate of $922.10 per fortnight will apply until their youngest child turns 14.The Gillard government a decade ago reduced the age cut-off from 16 to eight.Those parents currently on JobSeeker will receive an increase in payments of $176.90 per fortnight, if parliament passes legislation to enact the changes.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who announced the proposed change in Perth on Monday, said children of single-parent families deserved greater support.'I know first-hand what it's like to grow up with a single mum doing it tough and we want to make sure that the children of single-parent families have the best opportunities in life,' he told reporters.",
        "Dr Chalmers said the budget would balance cost-of-living relief with responsible management of spending.'We're confident what we've done here is provided some cost-of-living relief for people doing it tough, but conscious that we've got this inflationary challenge in our economy,' he told ABC Radio.'We need to be responsible about what we spend, and that's what we've done.'While also rolling out power bill relief, cheaper medicines and tax incentives for electrification and energy efficiency upgrades, the government has found $17.8 billion in savings.There is also expected to be $2.4 billion in extra revenue from taxes on offshore LNG producers."
