According to her website, she charges\u00a0 $685 for an hour long session, meaning Zolciak might have spent well over $2,000 for the conversation.She posted a picture of the phone call's jaw-dropping time stamp to her Instagram Story, writing: 'Just finished my reading with the best @nataliepsychic (holy s**t look at the time).'\u00a0",
