        "Carol's departure comes after she previously revealed that her future on ITV's Loose Women could be in jeopardy after a 'difficult contract issue'.After an 'unjust' contract request, the star has remained off-screen for the past two months - indicating that her time on the show could be coming to an end.",
        "Speaking to Best Magazine, she explained:\u00a0'I haven't been on the show for two months now because I've had to step away from it. It was causing me too much stress, which was mostly down to a difficult contract issue I'd been challenging since January.'The problem was, ITV were insisting, for the first time since I went back in 2018, that if I wanted to carry on doing the show, I would have to sign a contract that was totally unjust and unworkable for me, so I had to say \"no thanks\".Carol, who is a favourite for her fiery opinions on the show, was quick to emphasise her current situation.She added to the publication: 'I feel quite upset about it, if I'm honest, because although it is my decision, I felt like it was one I was being forced to make. No one in their right mind would have signed that contract. And I can't see a way back from it.'"
