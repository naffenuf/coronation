        "New Zealand will introduce a high-emission feeAussie drivers could face a similar feeNew Zealanders will soon have to pay thousands more to run the most polluting petrol cars, with warning signs a similar fee could be introduced in Australia as the push to go electric ramps up.",
        "The country's transport minister, Michael Wood, announced the country's new high-emission vehicle fee on Tuesday.The scheme will see petrol-guzzling vehicle buyers pay a one-off fee with the maximum for a new car sitting at $6,900, and $3,450 for used, if their car emits 192 or more grams of carbon per kilometre.Much of Australia's new electric vehicle policy under the Albanese government has been modelled on New Zealand and the European Union's legislation.Greenpeace Australia senior campaigner Lindsay Soutar even called on the government to follow in the footsteps of New Zealand when forming its\u00a0new fuel-efficiency standard.",
        "'From here, the task will be to implement strong standards in line with major markets like New Zealand,' she said.'The government needs to deliver for Australian households and the climate, not big car makers.'A future high-emission fee could be introduced as more electric cars become available on the second-hand market following the government's 2022 fringe benefits tax exemption.",
        "The Electric Vehicle Council explained the tax exemption will make it cheaper for companies to buy electric cars, which will then be put on the used car market.'Vehicles purchased under salary-sacrifice arrangements, and company fleets, are often sold after three or four years as relatively new second-hand vehicles,' it said.'(That) means potentially thousands of these second-hand EV, many still under warranty, will be available for every-day Australians to purchase and benefit from in the next few years.'",
        "Several states have already introduced their own incentives for Australians to buy electric vehicles with most offering registration discounts.The Australian Capital Territory government announced in February that from July 1, 2024, vehicle registration will be calculated based on emissions instead of weight.'This means lower registrations fees for lower-emission vehicles including plug\u2010in hybrid, hybrid electric vehicles, low emission petrol and diesel vehicles,' it said.",
        "Hussein Dia, a Professor of Future Urban Mobility at Sydney's\u00a0Swinburne University of Technology, said a similar registration fee system enforced Australia-wide could have the same effect as a high-emission fee.'Up to now, owners of electric vehicles have paid more for registration than those of high-polluting vehicles powered by petrol or diesel engines. Emissions-based fees will reverse that situation,' he wrote on The Conversation.'Policies that reduce registration fees and provide tax benefits to electric vehicle owners have been widely implemented overseas during the past few decades.'A number of studies on the effectiveness of carbon dioxide-based car taxation policies have found evidence they contribute to lowering transport emissions.'A measure such as introducing an emissions-based registration system is a step in the right direction.'"
