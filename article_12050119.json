        "Ms Hudson, who's been with the airline for 28 years, was announced as the new CEO on Tuesday.But an embarrassing blunder by Qantas chairman\u00a0Richard Goyder at a press conference saw him refer to Ms Hudson as 'Olivia' - referencing another CEO candidate and Qantas Loyalty chief Olivia Wirth'While it's never easy, the board firmly feels Olivia is the right person to take Qantas forward,' he said.Ms Hudson, a mother-of-two, said it was an 'honour' to step into the esteemed role.",
        "'This is an exceptional company full of incredibly talented people and it's very well positioned for the future,' she said.",
        "'My focus will be delivering for those we rely on and who rely on us \u2013 our customers, our employees, our shareholders and the communities we serve.'She began her career at Qantas in 1994 as an internal audit supervisor.Mr Joyce has been credited with helping to turn around the airline's fortunes, including the delivery of soaring profits after it emerged from the devastations of the Covid pandemic.However, he has also attracted controversy over his battles with unions, including over a 2020 decision to outsource the jobs of about 1600 ground crew.The Federal Court found the pandemic-era move was illegal, a decision the airline has appealed to the High Court.Ms Hudson's salary will be reviewed next August.\u00a0"
