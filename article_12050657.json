        "Newcastle are closing in on securing a brilliant return to the Champions League\u00a0The gloom under Mike Ashley has been replaced by noise, colour and optimism\u00a0For their fans it is passports and air fares on top of train tickets for them nowIt is like the most ferocious tide, washed in from the Central Station and up the hill to St James\u2019 Park, crashing through the back alleys and sweeping all along with it, sucked from the pubs and clubs, a bulging sea of black and white ferried gleefully on a wave of anticipation.",
        "The only folk leaving town on this sunny Sunday morning are the stags and hens. For the rest, the party has just begun. They flow from the platforms of train and Metro, the out of towners and the locals, united here by destination. The Match.Nineteen months ago, the tide trickled in and trickled out. The volume was the same, the verve less so. There was a stench of sewage, too. That was the football club, Newcastle Dis-United. Now, the river breeze carries only song and a whiff of success.At Greggs, the queue looks like a pantomime zebra, invading Neville Street and splitting the pubs that flank this bastion of Geordie cuisine. The Toon Army march on a full stomach, be that Brown Ale or steak and ale.There is a long row of station cabs, engines boiling over, much like their drivers\u2019 patience. They are redundant on matchday, for the main attraction rests within the city walls. Think Wembley dropped on Trafalgar Square.",
        "Just around the corner, at the Dog &amp; Parrot pub - one of 108 within a half-mile radius of St James\u2019 - a fan, his face flush to the window, rattles his tattooed knuckles on the pane. \u2018Any chance of opening up, Malcolm?\u2019. His plea penetrates the glass. Newcastle legend Malcolm Macdonald smiles and shrugs his shoulders. He is here to talk football, not pull pints. They used to have a comedian on, until they stopped showing the former manager\u2019s post-match interviews.",
        "It is 11.50am. Come noon, the punters flood in. \u2018You can smell it, feel it, it\u2019s like chalk and cheese,\u2019 says Supermac, comparing then and now. Then, of course, was pre takeover, pre Eddie Howe, pre third position in the Premier League.There is, rightly, debate and dispute about the identity of the new majority owners - Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund - but in the isolation of this city, and the sporting story at the heart of it, division belongs in the past.Outside the Gallowgate End and opposite Shearer\u2019s Bar - where a dad and his lads walk by, the boys draped in flags of Brazil and Paraguay - volunteers from the Newcastle United Fans Food Bank shake their buckets. The notes cushion the clangour of coins.\u2018The difference between Newcastle United pre and post takeover can be defined by two words - the response,\u2019 says volunteer Bill Corcoran. \u2018When the takeover happened, it made everyone feel like someone else had confidence in them as people. We have reaped the benefit and are getting donations just short of double what we did before (\u00a33,500 on this day).\u2018That is not because people are more generous, but because there is hope, inspired by the club and the team. We are riding a wave. This is a celebration of community, family, solidarity. The difference is night and day.\u2019",
        "Black and white, you might say.Saturday\u00a0afternoon, 24 hours before kick-off. In the old police cells beneath the Gallowgate, volunteers from Wor Flags are wrestling with a surfer flag, 255 feet in length. They need to move it to the opposite end of the ground. It is heavy.Earlier, they spoke to the Swedish Magpies, a group 50-strong and here for the weekend. They have some smaller flags they\u2019d like to add to the display. But where are they now? Some Nordic muscle would be most welcome. A text message is sent. They are, by chance, 100 yards away in the Newcastle shrine that is The Strawberry, full of beer and no less cheer.",
        "\u2018To see their faces when they came into the stadium to help us was quite something,\u2019 says Thomas Concannon. \u2018They were absolute gents, and we couldn\u2019t have carried that flag without them.\u2019The story of Wor Flags has unfurled just as quickly as that of their Champions League-bound team. They are, together, changing matchday traditions. Come 2.55pm, the clatter of turnstiles fades. Everyone has long taken to their seat. They are not just spectators, they are participants. The pre-match entertainment is self-generated, a sensory overload of noise and colour - flags whipped, lungs emptied, a stadium illuminated. No want for a trashy lights-show here.",
        "While the ritual has become as harmonised as Howe\u2019s side, a labour of love is needed for it to chime. Two days prior to every home game and often amid darkness, Concannon and his fellow volunteers enter St James\u2019 like black ops specialists. They know their job and execute it assiduously, making first for their store cupboard at the Strawberry Corner, a flag-bearer\u2019s survival stash of tape, scissors, sewing machine, poles and printer. Floodlights flicked to on, they buzz like moths between rows and aisles, stairwells and tiers.For all we marvel at the sight and sound of a full stadium, there is nothing more atmospheric than an empty one, especially when the ghosts of yesteryear are still to be laid to rest.",
        "\u2018I\u2019ve helped to arrange scores of our displays, and I still get the shivers,\u2019 says Concannon. \u2018It\u2019s like, \u201cWow, we\u2019re in here alone\u201d. Often, when we finish, we just sit in the stands and reminisce, goals, games, players, looking out at the empty pitch and all around us. It is an honour, really.\u2019Co-owner Mehrdad Ghodoussi has been particularly supportive and there is a mutual trust that affords access whenever needed. The club recognise the energy that spills from the stands and onto the pitch.On Sunday, against Arsenal, fans have been asked to bring their own scarves. The likes of Alan Shearer know the routine by now, whirl them as fast as you can above your head as the teams emerge. For the players, it will be like staring down a black-and-white kaleidoscope.",
        "\u2018When it comes to big games like this, we have proved that flags and scarves have a huge impact, it ignites something inside people,\u2019 says Concannon. \u2018But we can\u2019t do this without the fans. They support it. They fund it. We want that to continue. Imagine European nights next season\u2026 we can show the world what is happening here.\u2019A change of pace. Just off Low Moor Road in Langley Park, County Durham, there is a cemetery. Beneath hills that roll to the landscape\u2019s extreme, its peaceful surrounds are far removed from the beating pulse of St James\u2019. Here forever rests Sir Bobby Robson, in the village in which he was raised.There are few words on his headstone - \u2018In Loving Memory of Sir Bobby Robson, 1933-2008. Rest in Peace\u2019 - but in life he spoke many more, and those about his spiritual home are worth revisiting.",
        "Answering his own question - What is a club in any case? - Robson, the boyhood Newcastle fan, wrote: \u2018It\u2019s not the buildings or the directors or the people who are paid to represent it. It\u2019s the noise, the passion, the feeling of belonging, the pride in your city. It\u2019s a small boy clambering up stadium steps for the very first time, gripping his father\u2019s hand, gawping at that hallowed stretch of turf beneath him and, without being able to do a thing about it, falling in love.\u2019",
        "Back at St James\u2019 and approaching kick-off, the Swedes have gathered for a picture at the feet of Robson\u2019s statue. When told that compatriot Alexander Isak starts, they high-five one another as well as the natives - Gothenburg meets Gosforth.There are Dutch fans, too. While tourism is central to Newcastle\u2019s growth - not to mention the city\u2019s economy - the club must also protect the child Robson spoke about.Two of those boys, cousins Harry, 12, and Jake, eight, are outside The Strawberry. They are with Rob Nicholson, 36 - Jake\u2019s dad and Harry\u2019s uncle \u2013 and their Granddad Stephen, 66. The family are roaring down our camera lens. Confident?\u2018The boys are,\u2019 says Rob. \u2018They think we win every week. I\u2019m conditioned a different way.\u2019By the 21st minute of today\u2019s game versus Tottenham, they would have celebrated five goals. The boys were right. The Match ends 6-1. Now for the Night Out.",
        "Five minutes back down the hill and at the truly vivacious WonderBar - where London Zoo meets The Hacienda - the pantomime zebra is back, and this time it\u2019s dancing on the tables. Mad Mick Edmondson, the DJ, has it on strings. Every Newcastle player has his own song - from Abba\u2019s \u2018Gimme, Gimme, Gimme a striker from Sweden\u2019 to Ultrabeat\u2019s \u2018You\u2019ll never ever beat Dan Burn\u2019. The latter originated here.Matt Le Tissier called in recently and was sporting enough to jump on stage. \u2018You\u2019re just a s*** Alan Shearer\u2019 returned the crowd by way of thanks. It is no surprise takings have soared, as fans fill up on shots and empty their pockets.Mad Mick, 57, says: \u2018I\u2019ve done pre-match in this town since 1994, and it\u2019s always been mental, even when we were getting beat every week. But it\u2019s different now. They are queuing three hours before kick-off to get in.\u2018Matchday here is like nothing else in the world. It\u2019s like a carnival. You have your breakfast and a couple of pints and it builds slowly. The pubs then spill out and everyone is swept towards the ground. We are filled with hope, excitement. We\u2019re not desperate for a trophy, it\u2019s the competing that counts. This is like a dream you never want to end.\u2019As the pumps run dry and a city prepares for sleep, its people finally stream back through the estuaries from which they journeyed. They will need more than train tickets next season. It is passports and air fares for them now."
