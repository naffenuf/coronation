        "Coach Brad Scott is heartened by Essendon's improvement.",
        "But, in a strange way, he's more encouraged by things his team aren't getting right.\"I am really optimistic about what we're building,\" Scott said after the Bombers fell to a five-point away defeat to Port Adelaide.\"And that's partly because of what we're demonstrating.\"But probably the other half of it is, I can see all the really clear areas for us to improve.\"I am heartened by what we're doing, but more optimistic about the room for improvement. If we can put all that together, then the future is very bright.\"The Bombers made the early running against Port, leading by 15 points at quarter-time and by 14 at halftime on Sunday at Adelaide Oval.Port held a one-point buffer at three quarter-time and led by 13 when Junior Rioli goaled some 16 minutes into the final quarter.But just when appearing down and out, Essendon challenged again, culminating in ruck Andrew Phillips, from 50 metres out, having a set shot to square scores with less than a minute remaining.Phillips' shot fell short and was rushed for a behind, leaving Essendon with a four-four win-loss record in Scott's first year in charge.\"They have shown they have got the fight,\" Scott said of his players.\"The result didn't go our way.",
        "\"But if you have got that foundation, you're going to continue to fight no matter the score, then over time you'd like to think the close games go your way more often than not.\""
