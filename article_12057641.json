        "Wyndham Clark overcame the swift loss of his overnight lead to claim his first PGA Tour title in the Wells Fargo Championship.",
        "Clark\u2019s two-shot advantage was wiped out in the first three holes and the 29-year-old American found himself a shot behind playing partner Xander Schauffele after seven holes of the final round at Quail Hollow.However, Clark responded superbly to birdie five of the next eight and with Schauffele stumbling around the turn, the win became something of a formality.A closing 68 gave Clark a winning total of 19 under par and four-shot victory over Schauffele, with England\u2019s Tyrrell Hatton and American Harris English three strokes further back in third.Tommy Fleetwood and former world number one Adam Scott finished in a tie for fifth on 11 under.\u201cGosh, sorry, I\u2019m a little choked up,\u201d Clark told CBS after joining the likes of Anthony Kim, Rory McIlroy, Rickie Fowler and Max Homa in making the Wells Fargo Championship their maiden PGA Tour title.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long five years to get to this point on Tour and I thought I would have had one earlier, but it\u2019s well worth the wait and I\u2019m so grateful.\u201cThere\u2019s so much that goes into this and there\u2019s so many times I wanted to cry and break clubs \u2013 and I did break the club sometimes \u2013 in this journey and to get to this point is so sweet.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s just amazing to finally do this.\u201cI didn\u2019t start out great, I was kind of shaky and I think in years past I might have folded. This time I just stayed patient and hung in there and got hot on the back side.\u201dSchauffele was left to rue costly dropped shots on the ninth and 11th and told reporters: \u201cWhen you\u2019re trying to win on Sunday you need to put the screws down and put some pressure on the guys leading and I didn\u2019t do that.\u201cI probably had to shoot seven under today again to tie him or win by one. I think if I could have just put a little bit of pressure down through that mid part where I started leaking oil, it probably would have looked a little bit different.\u201cOnce again I\u2019m playing really solid and just had a flat Sunday unfortunately.\u201d"
