        "The ex-NSW Labor premier, 54, has ditched her long bob, and debuted a shorter and sharper side-swept blonde cropped hairstyle at the\u00a0prestigious annual Gold Dinner in Sydney on Thursday.The newly-appointed CEO of the Sydney Children's Hospital Foundation also showed off her toned biceps and glowing tan in a floor-length metallic gold gown, which featured a glittering bejewelled collar.She completed the look with\u00a0statement earrings and heels and carried a white mesh purse.\u00a0Kristina's visage looked youthful and was glowing thanks to a glossy makeup.",
        "Five hundred of the city's leading philanthropists and VIPs attended the event, which benefits the foundation.The charity hopes to achieve a double-digit target this year after the charity gala raised $9million last year.\u00a0This year's Sydney Children's Hospitals Foundation (SCHF) Gold Dinner is set to raise millions to transform complex paediatric care in Australia.\u00a0The gala will benefit The Children's Hospital at Westmead Kids Complex Care Centre, to be known as the Kookaburra Centre.",

        "SCHF Board Chair, Mr Len Chersky said the charity was delighted to welcome the 'calibre' of the former NSW premier.'We know her voice and vision will help SCHF continue to make a positive impact on the lives of sick kids and their families through funding world-class healthcare and research,' Mr Chersky said.'Kristina is a fierce advocate for children and their families, as well as improving access to healthcare for kids.'Importantly, Kristina is a proven leader who has demonstrated her strength, discipline and composure during her career and will bring the strategic and leadership skills ... to achieve its important mission.'"
