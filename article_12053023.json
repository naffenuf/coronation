        "Warnock and Huddersfield secured Championship survival on Thursday nightThe 74-year-old will now leave the club after completing what he set out to doHe referenced the usefulness of experience for managers such as Roy Hodgson\u00a0'It will be good for the oldies,\u2019 said 68-year-old Sam Allardyce when asked what it would mean to steer Leeds United clear from relegation.",
        "Roy Hodgson, 75, has kept Crystal Palace in the Premier League while Neil Warnock, 74, secured Huddersfield Town\u2019s Championship status with a win against his boyhood club Sheffield United on Thursday.\u2018He\u2019s right \u2014 look at what happened with Neil Warnock at Huddersfield,\u2019 said Pep Guardiola after Allardyce sang the praises of older coaches and put himself up there with the likes of the Manchester City manager, plus Jurgen Klopp and Mikel Arteta.Warnock\u2019s great escape act in West Yorkshire has been nothing short of remarkable, as Guardiola pointed out. He has achieved safety with a game to spare.Since he cut short his holiday to take the job in February with Huddersfield only off the bottom on goal difference, only four teams have won more points in the Championship and his side have played 11 of the top 13 in those 14 games in charge.",
        "And Warnock\u2019s first port of call when he eventually made way from the celebrations and strolled into the press conference room on Thursday evening was to thank one of the local reporters, as he turned to Steven Chicken of the Huddersfield Examiner.\u2018Can I thank you Steven for picking the team? My team was different and then I read your column in the paper this morning and decided to go a little bit more defensive,\u2019 Warnock said. On Thursday morning, he opted for Rarmani Edmonds-Green at right wing-back and played Josh Koroma up front, instead of Joseph Hungbo.",
        "\u2018Where do you want your statue (for saving Huddersfield) then?\u2019 asked Chicken. \u2018There\u2019ll be a few pigeons happy about that, all over the country,\u2019 responded Warnock in typical fashion.Huddersfield may have been 90 minutes away from the Premier League this time last year, when they were beaten by Nottingham Forest in the play-off final, but the euphoria from the 20,000-plus in West Yorkshire after a 1-0 win to secure their Championship status showed just how much survival meant \u2014 as did the adulation for Warnock around the ground. Warnock himself ranked it as the biggest achievement of his 43-year managerial career.\u2018Right at the top \u2014 I\u2019ve not had anything more difficult,\u2019 he told Mail Sport. \u2018I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been any prouder. I think it\u2019s a massive achievement.\u2018When (assistant) Ronnie Jepson phoned after the Stoke City game (which Huddersfield lost 3-0), I was in New York and he said to me, \u201cGaffer, are you sure? It\u2019s the worst team I\u2019ve ever seen in the Championship.\u201d\u2018So to come and then have two 4-0 defeats and still get out, it\u2019s just fantastic. I can\u2019t be any prouder to be the man in charge when we\u2019ve done something like this.\u2018And I like to think we\u2019ve had a bit of humour and a laugh along the way. I try to take all the pressure off the players by being a little bit humorous and even at half-time, I said a couple of funny things just to break it up.",
        "\u2018I didn\u2019t swear too much. You\u2019ve got to get a dressing room that wants to do it for you, that wants to die for three points.\u2019 From seven wins in 31 games before Warnock\u2019s arrival to six wins in 14 under him and Jepson, they have transformed the fortunes of the Terriers. The pair were even given a guard of honour by Huddersfield\u2019s squad.\u2018That\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever had one of them,\u2019 admitted Warnock. \u2018It was quite emotional all the way around the ground. It\u2019s been an amazing rollercoaster ride. I think this will have converted youngsters to be Huddersfield Town fans for years to come.\u2018I remember going to Bramall Lane one night and it was amazing. I think it was Arsenal we were playing, in floodlights, and I just remember, \u201cWow \u2014 Joe Shaw, Doc Pace\u201d, how brilliant they were, and that just did me. I had to be Sheffield United and I hope this will have created a few more Huddersfield Town fans.\u2018You can\u2019t replicate an evening like this when that whistle goes \u2014 no matter what you say. As old as I am, it\u2019s still the same when that whistle goes and you know how much it means. It\u2019s just a fantastic feeling.\u2019Asked why himself and Hodgson have had such success since answering their SOS calls, Warnock stressed the importance of experience.",
        "\u2018But he has some good players doesn\u2019t he, Roy? Wilfried Zaha, Ebere Eze, Michael Olise and all them. B***** hell, I\u2019d have that job,\u2019 joked Warnock.\u2018When you get older, I think it\u2019s the calmness and the confidence you bring. You look at what Roy\u2019s done and he\u2019s just given them freedom. Like Jaheim Headley here. At half-time, I gave him a roasting telling him, \u201cI\u2019d have played somebody else if I\u2019d known you were going to cut back inside all the time. Take him on. I\u2019m not bothered if you lose it\u201d.\u2018In the second half he was superb and it\u2019s just directing them really.\u2019As the questions kept on coming, he laughed: \u2018I could stop here with you lot all night but I want a Negroni now!\u2019\u2018Anyone else?\u2019 asked Warnock, before noticing former Sheffield United striker Carl Asaba, who played under him at Bramall Lane, in among the dozen or so journalists.\u2018Sarbs, I didn\u2019t b***** recognise you with your hat on! I\u2019ve only just seen you now. B***** hell, are you all right? Is your family all right?\u2019 said Warnock. He was like a child buzzing with excitement \u2014 more than 1,600 matches into his managerial career but still in love with the game.",
        "Monday\u2019s home clash against Reading will be a survival party now for Huddersfield fans at the expense of the opposition, who were sent down as a result of Thursday\u2019s win.",
        "Warnock will also say goodbye to the fans as his short-term contract expires. For now, he has no plans of extending his deal.\u2018I couldn\u2019t do 10 months of this. I\u2019ll be back next February somewhere. I\u2019m sure she (wife Sharon) will get fed up of me at home,\u2019 joked Warnock. \u2018But I think the job\u2019s done here for me. I\u2019ve really enjoyed it.\u2019Now those a few miles up the M62 will be hoping that another managerial veteran in Allardyce will lead them to their own great escape."
