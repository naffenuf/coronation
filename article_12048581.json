        "A senior Conservative MP and China hawk has said it is \u201cabsurdity\u201d that a building the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) operates out of has Chinese surveillance cameras attached to it.",
        "Former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith said CCTV made by Beijing-based firm Hikvision should be removed from a property that is home to the security agency\u2019s North West secure site.It comes after Channel 4 News reported that it had found at least nine cameras made by surveillance equipment manufacturer Hikvision on Heron House, a property in central Manchester that the security agency has offices in.GCHQ said it does not operate Hikvision cameras on its part of the building, which it reportedly leases from Manchester City Council. It seems an absurdity to me and they should get rid of them  Tory MP Sir Iain Duncan Smith  The broadcaster\u2019s report comes after ministers instructed Government departments in November to stop installing surveillance cameras made by Chinese firms on \u201csensitive sites\u201d owing to security concerns.Making the announcement, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Oliver Dowden said ministries should consider whether they should immediately remove and replace such equipment from sensitive sites, rather than wait for scheduled upgrades.Hikvision, a shortened version of its full name Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Company, is banned in the US because of concerns it could share intelligence with the Chinese Communist Party.MPs have previously called for the prohibition of equipment manufactured by Hikvision due to the company reportedly having their cameras deployed in internment camps in China\u2019s Xinjiang province as part of the persecution of the Uighur Muslims and other minorities.",
        "Sir Iain described the finding of Hikvision surveillance equipment on Heron House as a \u201cbig deal\u201d.He told Channel 4: \u201cI know that (GCHQ) will come back and say things like they\u2019re not our buildings officially, they belong to the city centre \u2026 (to) the council.\u201cBut the truth is they are the number one, the most important security centre that we have.",
        "\u201cGCHQ knows everything and, therefore, they are hugely relevant in this debate and they should not have those cameras.\u201cAfter all, the security service themselves have said they shouldn\u2019t have them, so it\u2019s ironic that the senior part of the security services has them.\u201cThat seems an absurdity to me and they should get rid of them.\u201dSir Iain added: \u201cWho walks through that building is recorded.\u201dA GCHQ spokesman said: \u201cHeron House is a multi-tenancy building.\u201cGCHQ does not operate Hikvision products at any of its sites, including Heron House.\u201cWe have a range of measures in place to protect the security of our people, systems and sites, which for obvious reasons we will not describe in detail.\u201dHikvision has been contacted for comment. The firm has previously said it was \u201ccategorically false\u201d to represent it as a national security threat.Manchester City Council has also been contacted in relation to the ownership of the building."
