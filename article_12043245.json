        "Chris Packham has said people know he is \u201cnot Jason Bourne\u201d and would not think he went \u201cpliers in hand\u201d to rescue tigers, the environmentalist has told the High Court.",
        "The TV presenter is suing three men for libel over nine articles which included claims he defrauded and \u201cmanipulated\u201d people into donating to a charity to rescue tigers while knowing the animals were well looked after.The strongly denied allegations, repeated in several tweets and videos, relate to Mr Packham\u2019s involvement with the Wildheart Trust, which runs a wildlife sanctuary on the Isle of Wight.Dominic Wightman, editor of the online site Country Squire Magazine, is defending the libel claim along with writer Nigel Bean and a third man, Paul Read.",
        "On the second day of the trial on Wednesday, the BBC Springwatch presenter began his evidence, spending most of the day in the witness box at the London court.Lawyers for Mr Wightman and Mr Bean have said the articles in the claim could be defended as true while Mr Read said he was not responsible for the publications as he was a \u201cmere proofreader\u201d.Nicholas O\u2019Brien, representing Mr Wightman and Mr Bean, alleged Mr Packham fraudulently raised money by saying five tigers needed to be rescued from a circus when they did not need a rescue \u2013 allegations referred to in court as \u201ctiger fraud\u201d.In his written evidence, Mr Packham said the tigers, which had been used in a Spanish circus, had been left in a holding facility before they came into the care of animal welfare group AAP.",
        " I don\u2019t think that at any stage the public were under the misapprehension that I was going out with pliers in hand to go and rescue the tigers myself  Chris Packham, environmentalist  They were then moved to the Wildheart Animal Sanctuary as their \u201cforever home\u201d.Discussing a fundraising video posted by Mr Packham about the need to \u201crescue\u201d the tigers, Mr O\u2019Brien said: \u201cThis was the beginning of a fundraising effort to support the transfer and accommodation of the tigers.\u201cThese tigers were at AAP and not in need of rescue whatsoever.\u201dMr Packham denied this, adding the tigers\u2019 owners had \u201cabandoned them in appalling conditions for nearly a year\u201d and that AAP had limited capacity.He continued: \u201cThey are part of a chain of rescue. Whilst the animals were at AAP recovering and getting decent medical care, providing a forever home is very much part and parcel of a rescue process.\u201dMr O\u2019Brien said Mr Packham was involved in a \u201csustained\u201d fundraising campaign based on \u201cmisleading statements\u201d about the tigers\u2019 status and history.He said: \u201cYou have allowed members of the public to believe that the tigers are in immediate danger \u2013 that you have yourself been trying to rescue them.\u201dMr Packham told the court \u201cpeople know me as not Jason Bourne\u201d and they would not think he was cutting the bars of circus cages.",
        "He also said: \u201cI don\u2019t think that at any stage the public were under the misapprehension that I was going out with pliers in hand to go and rescue the tigers myself.\u201cWe were very clear about the role of AAP and our role in the rescue process,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI refute your allegation that we have attempted to mislead the public.\u201dMr O\u2019Brien asked: \u201cIf those tigers had been unlawfully locked up in a zoo and you sent people with wire cutters to free them, that would be a rescue.\u201dMr Packham replied: \u201cI suppose in a James Bond sense they could.\u201cWe would go through all the necessary legal hoops. We wouldn\u2019t be busting into a zoo.\u201dThe trial before Mr Justice Saini is due to conclude on May 12, with a decision expected at a later date."
