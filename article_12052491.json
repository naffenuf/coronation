        "A Cambridge pub is hosting a \u201cnot bothered\u201d coronation party on Saturday as a \u201crespectful antidote to monarchy madness\u201d.",
        "As the country was gearing up for the big day, the Sir Isaac Newton pub wanted to \u201cdo something a little bit different\u201d to mark the occasion, assistant manager Shelley Turner told the PA news agency.Speaking inside the traditional English pub, Ms Turner said the staff had put up \u201chappy generic evening\u201d bunting and erected a cardboard cut-out of Sir David Attenborough because \u201che really should be king\u201d.Ms Turner explained: \u201cWe noticed that everyone was kind of doing the same thing for the coronation and after speaking to customers, some of them would say, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m not that bothered\u2019.\u201cNot everyone\u2019s so excited about the monarchy so let\u2019s give the rebels a bit of a party as well.\u201dThe Sir Isaac Newton will be throwing a fancy dress party and buffet for children during the day, while a DJ will be on decks as \u201cBlue Blood\u201d cocktails will be served in the evening.",
        "Although the theme of the party is anti-establishment, the pub \u201cstill wants to be really inclusive,\u201d Ms Turner said.\u201cI know customers who love the monarchy and are really excited to come in.\u201dMs Turner said that the reaction to the pub\u2019s event has \u201call been positive, even online\u201d.She said: \u201cI have not heard one negative thing said about it.\u201d",
        "When people see the chalkboard outside the pub advertising its anti-establishment party, \u201cthey get a smile on their face,\u201d Ms Turner said, adding: \u201cI\u2019ve heard people talking about it to others, and it just seems to lift them really.\u201dThe pub ultimately wants the message of its party to be one of inclusivity and fun.Ms Turner said: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter what side of the divide you are on because I do find that these days, things seem to be quite divided in a lot of spheres.\u201cYou can still have a party together and joke about these things and just be light about them, not be so serious.\u201d"
