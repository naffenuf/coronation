        "COPENHAGEN, May 4 (Reuters) - Office services group ISS said on Thursday it is taking longer to negotiate deals with large customers as top managers there take a bigger role in discussions around the workplace in an attempt to attract workers back to the office.ISS, one of the world's biggest employers, said that while the COVID-19 pandemic created more demand for cleaning services, companies are now also paying more attention to the broader appeal of their offices.\"This has suddenly become part of the overall strategy for our clients,\" Chief Executive Jacob Aarup-Andersen told Reuters.\"It has become a bigger and more important thing internally and that also means they have longer cycles,\" he said, referring the time it takes to negotiate contracts.ISS provides services ranging from call centres to office cleaning, catering and security to more than 40,000 customers globally, including 20 of the world's 30 largest banks.Aarup-Andersen said clients were investing more in redesign of the workspace to cater for new and more collaborative ways of working as well as in upgrading food offerings.\"Many companies have realized that in order to continue to drive innovation and build company culture you have to have a certain level of physical presence at the office,\" he said.\"We definitely see that many employers are now investing more in increasing the attractiveness of the workplace after the pandemic,\" he said.",
