        "Scotland forward Jonny Gray is in serious danger of missing the Rugby World Cup after dislocating his kneecap.",
        "Gray sustained the injury during Exeter\u2019s 47-28 Heineken Champions Cup semi-final defeat by La Rochelle on Sunday.\u201cIt\u2019s relatively serious without being the worst it could be,\u201d said Exeter rugby director Rob Baxter.",
        "\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve been told unless the operation goes exceptionally well and his recovery is exceptionally quick, I would say he is very doubtful for the World Cup.\u201cIt\u2019s a patella tendon injury, he\u2019s dislocated his kneecap.\u201cFortunately the other major ligaments within the knee are all stable.\u201cIt\u2019s a relatively complex patella tendon injury, which is going to require surgery this week, and there\u2019s a relatively long period of rehab",
        "\u201cWe are hopeful to have him back fairly early next season, especially with the Premiership starting late next year with the World Cup first.\u201dSecond-row Gray, 29, has won 77 caps for Scotland and his absence from the World Cup in France would be a huge blow for Gregor Townsend\u2019s side.Scotland start their World Cup campaign against defending champions South Africa in Marseille on September 10.Pool B also includes Six Nations Grand Slam champions Ireland, Romania and Tonga."
