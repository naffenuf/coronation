        "Lucy Frazer said a review into the corporation\u2019s funding arrangements is looking at \u201ca variety of sources for its funding\u201d.The Cabinet minister also said Rishi Sunak will appoint the \u201cbest candidate\u201d to replace Richard Sharp as BBC chair, regardless of their political ties. I do think it might need to look at a variety of sources for its funding  Lucy Frazer, Culture Secretary  It comes after Sir Keir Starmer said Labour would replace the Government\u2019s power to appoint the chair with an independent process, following Mr Sharp\u2019s resignation after he was found to have broken the rules by failing to disclose he played a part in getting Boris Johnson an \u00a3800,000 loan guarantee.\u201cWe will be looking for the best candidate,\u201d Ms Frazer told Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge On Sunday.\u201cI strongly believe that we should not disqualify people from public office who put themselves forward, who are capable of doing the job, because they happen to have in the past supported a political party.\u201d",
        "The BBC funding model has long been under consideration by the Government, which has argued the licence fee is losing support among the public amid a changing media landscape.\u201cWe are reviewing the licence fee. I\u2019ve started that review,\u201d Ms Frazer told the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg On Sunday programme.",

The licence fee isn\u2019t the only way.\u201dTory former culture secretary Nadine Dorries announced last year that the licence fee would be frozen at \u00a3159 for the next two years until April 2024, saying she wanted to find a new funding model before the current deal expires in 2027 as it is \u201ccompletely outdated\u201d."
