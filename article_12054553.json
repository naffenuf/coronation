        "The weather may have been wet, but that did not dampen the spirits of the crowds who lined the streets of London for a glimpse of\u00a0the new King.",
        "Some had grabbed their spots along the 1.42 mile processional route between Westminster Abbey and Buckingham Palace in the early hours of the morning \u2013 wanting a front-row seat when the newly-crowned monarch appeared.Adorned in patriotic clothing, headwear and waving Union flags, many had prepared for the adverse weather, donning ponchos and popping up umbrellas when the rain began mid-morning.",
        "During the long wait for the first procession, members of the public kept themselves entertained with renditions of God Save The King and pop classic Sweet Caroline, while some of the 10,000-strong crowd poured champagne.At Trafalgar Square, there were spontaneous cheers and applause as a portable toilet on the back of a flatbed truck made its way down the street towards Westminster, while along The Mall chants of \u201cyou\u2019re not singing over there\u201d were heard and some started a Mexican wave.A small group of anti-monarchist protesters gathered close to the procession route at the top of Whitehall shouting \u201cnot my King\u201d \u2013 they were met by boos and opposing chants of \u201cGod save the King\u201d.The group \u2013 many of whom were dressed in yellow waving placards with slogans including \u201cking parasite\u201d and \u201cabolish the monarchy\u201d \u2013 stood shoulder to shoulder with royal supporters bedecked in Union flags.",
        "Applause rang out as the public caught the first glimpse of the King and Queen as they left Buckingham Palace in the Diamond Jubilee State Coach around 10.20am.",
        "People clamoured to catch sight of the royal couple as they travelled up The Mall and towards the Abbey.Many people lining the route watched the proceedings from their phones or listened to a live audiofeed of the ceremony.A 3,800-capacity stand near Buckingham Palace was filled with public servants including NHS and social care workers, military veterans and members of the royal household staff.One, Caitlin Adeniyi-Jones \u2013 an emergency department nurse at King\u2019s College Hospital in London, said: \u201cIt was incredible to see it unfold, fascinating for someone with no knowledge about the fanfare.\u201cWe got very wet, but pushed through.\u201d",
        "Cheers rang out from crowds in Green Park watching on big screens at key moments during the ceremony.And many gasped after hearing the gun salute, which occurred at the moment the King was crowned.Those who bagged a spot along the procession route enjoyed an impressive parade by armed service personnel\u00a0who accompanied Charles and Camilla as they made their way back to Buckingham Palace in the 260-year-old Gold State Coach.The return procession featured the music of 20 different bands from across the Armed Forces.",
        "The King, sitting on the right-hand side of the carriage, smiled and waved at the crowds as he was driven towards The Mall.A military band played God Save The King as he passed by, drowning out a group of protesters shouting \u201cnot my King\u201d.",
        "There was one tense moment just after the King and Queen\u2019s carriage rounded the corner from Whitehall into The Mall when one of the horses in the procession appeared to be spooked, rearing backwards into the barriers separating the public from the route.A female police officer appeared to be given assistance from her colleagues, limping away from the area.People in the grandstand near the Palace caught the final viewing of the Coronation Parade as the King and Queen passed by, with many waving and cheering as other members of the royal family were driven past \u2013 including the Prince and Princess of Wales and their three children \u2013 George, Charlotte and Louis.As the coronation procession finished, the rain over central London eased and royal watchers emerged from hoods and umbrellas.After the procession ended, people lining The Mall were given the opportunity to move in front of Buckingham Palace to see the family as they appeared on the famous balcony, many running to get a spot.",
        "The crowd roared when the royal family appeared, giving the King three cheers.",
        "People watched in awe as the Red Arrows flew overhead in a scaled-down flypast \u2013 leaving streaks of red, white and blue in the sky above the palace.Sodden crowds started to disperse after the family left the balcony, but many turned back after the King and Queen came out for a second appearance.Rachel Casey, who travelled up from Surrey at 5am to watch the occasion, summed up the day, saying: \u201cWe got wet and cold but it did not matter. It\u2019s a once in a lifetime event.\u201d"
