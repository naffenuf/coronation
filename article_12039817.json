        "Thousands of personnel from the Army, navy and RAF marched from Buckingham Palace past Trafalgar Square and Downing Street to Westminster Abbey.The Diamond Jubilee State Coach and Gold State Coach were marched down the Mall as part of the preparations for the May 6 event. The Diamond Jubilee State Coach was accompanied by hundreds of soldiers on horseback as it travelled along the Mall, setting off shortly after 12.20am on Wednesday.Royal fanatics waited for over three hours for the parade to make a return journey down the Mall. Crowds ran through St James' Park to find the best spots near the palace with many trying to spot their relatives in their military outfits.Many soldiers carried a wide range of instruments such as saxophones, trumpets, horns and cymbals but only the drums were played by marching soldiers until they returned down the Mall after 3am.The parade had began when soldiers dressed in bright yellow uniforms began the short journey and the brass band on horseback practised as they accompanied the stage coach as it passed through Westminster.\u00a0",
        "Onlookers skipped along next to the stage coach and ran after the regiments of mounted soldiers that followed. Soldiers from a wide variety of regiments marched down the Mall after 1am.",

        "Buckingham Palace remained mostly silent with soldiers quietly maintaining protocol until a regiment playing the bagpipes brought the area to life shortly after 2.30am.At least 15 tents are already positioned along the Mall and royal fans got to test their viewpoint as they prepare to camp out until Saturday.John Loughrey, 68, claimed to be the first person to set up his tent on the Mall on April 27, nine days before the Coronation.He said: 'We like the build up, the rehearsals and seeing people throughout the day. There are a lot of tourists and they come and say they wish they had something like this in their country.'Mr Loughrey explained he had been camping outside royal events for 26 years and spent a month camping out after Princess Charlotte was born. He added: 'We did a lot of research. We (picked this spot) because there are no trees so you can see the Red Arrows.'Other soldiers were spotted parading in Parliament Square and practised changing position as Big Ben chimed.Artillery regiments rehearsed moving cannons on horseback and soldiers were seen pretending to fire the ceremonial weapons.The procession returned to Buckingham Palace shortly after 3am with bands in full swing. The Gold State Coach was spotted passing Buckingham Palace shortly after 3.20am.",
        "The rehearsal took place hours after a man was arrested outside Buckingham Palace after throwing suspected shotgun cartridges into the palace grounds.The man was held on suspicion of possession of an offensive weapon after he was searched and a knife was found, but he was not carrying a gun.Cordons were put in place and Scotland Yard said a controlled explosion was carried out as a precaution as the man had a 'suspicious bag'.Cordons were put in place after the man was found with a 'suspicious bag' but have since been removed.Ricardo Sousa and Elizabeth Godfrey, who are among those camping at the Mall, said they 'didn't even know anything had happened.''We work not far from here and we're night owls so instead of going to bed we thought we should come down and watch,' the pair explained.'It's something to be part of and it's nice to see the military from different parts of world united.'",
        "Gemma Gale, whose husband is a Royal Navy reserve who was marching during the rehearsal, said it was 'disgusting' that there was a police incident earlier in the night.Ms Gale, 41, said: 'We're from the south coast and my husband is marching tonight. This is brilliant, it's all amazing.",
        "'It doesn't surprise me something happened earlier tonight, unfortunately, it's to be expected.'With events like this it's opportunists, they're all out because they have a big audience with the coronation. It's not right, it's disgusting.'At least 15 tents are already positioned along the mall and royal fans got to test out what view they will have of the King when a carriage was pulled along the Mall by white horses.",
        "With just four days to go until the coronation, superfans have said they are prepared to camp out for several days to secure\u00a0front-row seats to Saturday's festivities.",
        "'This is a moment in history. We are so fortunate that we are living through a coronation,' Marie Scott, who was among the first to set up camp on the avenue leading to Buckingham Palace, said yesterday.Ms Scott, 52, has been attending royal events since the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton in 2011. She said being there in person is not the same as watching it from a TV screen.'You've got to see them with your own eyes and get the feel of everything around you,' Ms Scott explained as she finished setting up a tent.'It's magical, seeing all the military, the military bands coming down. It makes you proud, proud to be British.'",
        "Ms Scott is with a group of friends, who have reserved their spots days in advance.\u00a0Among them is Carol Foster, 63, who has been camping on The Mall since last Thursday.'We wanted to get a good spot, because we think it's going to be busy. And it's a once-in-a-lifetime thing,' Ms Foster said after her first night of camping.Also part of their group is Patrick O'Neill, who flew in from Belfast in Northern Ireland and is a seasoned attendee of royal events.He said he has come to 'soak up the atmosphere' in the run-up to the coronation and to spend time with people who share a common passion.'It's important that I'll be with my friends that I've met over the years from all different places in the country,' said Mr O'Neill, donning a plastic crown and wrapped in a Union Jack flag with a portrait of King Charles.'It's a real interest. It's a real passion... It's hard to put into words how much it means to me,' he said.",
        "Further up The Mall and a few steps closer to Buckingham Palace was Faith Nicholson, who shares a long list of royal events that she has attended over the years.'It's a great atmosphere, everybody is really kind and everyone looks after each other,' Ms Nicholson said. 'Once it really kicks off, it's really memorable'.",
        "The upcoming coronation - the first since 1953 - has also attracted visitors from abroad, like Thomas Moore, an American with English roots who travelled from near Salt Lake City with his wife Stephanie.Mr Moore, 80, said they have crossed the Atlantic for many royal events over the years, the last being Queen Elizabeth II's Platinum Jubilee, marking her 70 years on the throne, last year.'I get goosebumps when I see a king driving by. I'm part of an old generation where that means a lot,' Moore said as they set up folding camping chairs.'This is a very special occasion. This is going into your blood.'"
