Thank you for handling everything,\"' she said of one of her new techniques.\u00a0",

I'm excited.'As part of her recovery, Menounos will have to continue to get regular scans of her pancreas for the next five years.The couple's daughter , via the surrogate, is expected to arrive into their lives this summer."
