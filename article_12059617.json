        "Omar Bogle\u2019s late double looked to have earned Newport a final-day victory over Crewe but the visitors claimed a 2-2 draw thanks to Lachlan Brook\u2019s stoppage-time leveller.",
        "Crewe led in the 56th minute thanks to a stunning strike from Rio Adebisi, but Bogle levelled from the spot 13 minutes from time.And the striker was in the right place to bundle home what looked certain to be the winner in the 91st minute, before Brook\u2019s 93rd-minute equaliser secured a share of the points.Daniel Agyei should have put Crewe ahead in the second minute and was later denied by a superb save from Nick Townsend.Crewe broke the deadlock when defender Adebisi beat Townsend from 30 yards with a superb strike.But Bogle\u2019s cool penalty, after substitute Charlie McNeill was fouled in the box, made it 1-1.",
        "Bogle then turned in McNeill\u2019s cross from close range for his 19th goal of the season, but the Exiles were caught napping at the other end and Brook earned Crewe a deserved draw."
