        "Hollywood writers striking over pay and job security are picketing major studios and streamers at the outset of industrial action that forced late-night shows into hiatus, put other productions on pause and slowed down the entire industry.",
        "The first Hollywood strike in 15 years commenced on Tuesday as the 11,500 members of the Writers Guild of America (WGA) stopped working when their contract expired.The union is seeking higher minimum pay, more writers per show and less exclusivity on single projects, among other demands \u2013 all conditions it says have been diminished during the content boom of the streaming era.Kelly Galuska, 39, a writer for The Bear on FX and Big Mouth on Netflix, said from the picket lines at Fox Studios in Los Angeles: \u201cEverything\u2019s changed, but the money has changed in the wrong direction.\u201cIt\u2019s a turning point in the industry right now. And if we don\u2019t get back to even, we never will.\u201dThe last Hollywood strike, from the same union in 2007 and 2008, took three months to resolve.With no talks or even plans to talk pending between the WGA and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMTPT), which represents studios and productions companies, there is no telling how long writers will have to go without pay, or how many major productions will be delayed, shortened or scrapped.Josh Gad, a writer for shows including Central Park and the voice of Olaf from the Frozen movies, said from the Fox picket line: \u201cWe\u2019ll stay out as long as it takes.\u201d",
        "The AMPTP said in a statement that it presented an offer with \u201cgenerous increases in compensation for writers as well as improvements in streaming residuals\u201d and was prepared to improve its offer \u201cbut was unwilling to do so because of the magnitude of other proposals still on the table that the guild continues to insist upon\u201d.The writers were well aware that a stoppage was likely. Yet the breakdown of contractual talks hours before a deadline that negotiations in previous years have sailed past left some people surprised, some worried, and some determined.Jonterri Gadson, a writer whose credits include A Black Lady Sketch Show, said: \u201cWhen I saw the refusals to counter and the refusing to even negotiate by the AMPTP, I was like on fire to get out here and stand up for what we deserve.\u201dOn a picket line at Amazon Studios, she held up a sign that read: \u201cI hate it here.\u201dAll of the top late-night American shows, which are staffed by writers that pen monologues and jokes for their hosts, immediately went off-air. NBC\u2019s The Tonight Show, Comedy Central\u2019s Daily Show, ABC\u2019s Jimmy Kimmel Live, CBS\u2019 The Late Show and NBC\u2019s Late Night all made plans to show repeats during the week.NBC\u2019s Saturday Night Live, which had been scheduled to air a new episode on Saturday, will also go off the air, with a repeat being shown instead. Two remaining episodes in the season are in jeopardy.",
        "The strike\u2019s impact on scripted series and films will likely take longer to notice \u2013 though some shows, including Showtime\u2019s Yellowjackets, have already paused production on forthcoming seasons.If a strike persists through the summer, autumn TV schedules could be upended. In the meantime, those with finished scripts are permitted to continue shooting.Union members also picketed in New York, where less known writers were joined by more prominent peers like playwright and screenwriter Tony Kushner (The Fabelmans) and Dopesick creator Danny Strong.Some actors including Rob Lowe joined the picket lines in support in Los Angeles. Many striking writers, like Gad, are hybrids who combine writing with other roles.Gad said of his fellow writers: \u201cWe are nothing without their words. We have nothing without them.\u201cAnd so it\u2019s imperative that we resolve this in a way that benefits the brilliance that comes out of each of these people.\u201dThe acting side of Gad\u2019s career could be involved in a similar dispute soon, with many of the same issues at the centre of negotiations for both the actors\u2019 union SAG-AFTRA and the Directors Guild of America. Contracts for both expire in June.Streaming has exploded the number of series and films that are annually made, meaning more jobs for writers. But writers have cited shifting and insecure conditions that the WGA called \u201ca gig economy inside a union workforce\u201d.",
        "The union is seeking more compensation for writers up-front, because many of the payments writers have historically profited from on the back end \u2013 like syndication and international licensing \u2013 have been largely phased out by the onset of streaming.The AMPTP said sticking points to a deal revolved around so-called mini-rooms \u2013 the guild is seeking a minimum number of scribes per writers\u2019 room \u2013 and the duration of employment contracts.Writers are also seeking more regulation around the use of artificial intelligence, which the WGA\u2019s writers say could give producers a shortcut to finishing their work."
