        "Celebrations took place in Sunderland as crowds gathered in Keel Square to watch the King\u2019s coronation.",
        "A big screen was set up in the city centre with picnic benches and chairs for viewers, while activities including face painting, a Punch and Judy show and crown-making went on throughout the day.Plenty arrived to watch the event on a warm morning in Sunderland, including Kath Stark, 67, from Washington, who was with clients she supports who have learning difficulties.Wearing a white T-shirt with a picture of the King and the Union flag, she told the PA news agency: \u201cWatching the coronation, I just like history and have come to see the King crowned.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s just a joyous day out for the customers, just everyone\u2019s in a party mood, everyone\u2019s happy so we\u2019re going to stay quite a few hours if the weather holds.\u201cThe history (of the coronation) is massive. I\u2019m a royalist, I think they do very well for the country. I know not everybody thinks the same, but I think they do.\u201cThe history, we\u2019ve had them for over one thousand years, I just enjoy it.\u201cI enjoy watching things like this, like the jubilee, even the Queen\u2019s funeral, the big processions, nobody does it like we do.\u201dAs St Edward\u2019s Crown was placed on the King\u2019s head, the crowd at Keel Square cheered and there was a gentle patter of applause.",
        "Victoria Mills, 45, is a housing support officer from South Shields and watched with friends from work and her children.\u201c(The coronation has) been brilliant, I\u2019ve really enjoyed it,\u201d she said.",
        "\u201cI think it just brings the community together, the whole country\u2019s going to be watching, it\u2019s just a real British and patriotic thing.\u201dHilary Buttigieg, 56, was also among the revellers.Originally from the city, she now lives in Luton, but returned for a visit and expressed her excitement at watching \u201ca moment in history\u201d.She told PA: \u201cIt\u2019s a moment in history, the last time was with the Queen many years ago.\u201cI think we\u2019ve got some people who are for it, some who are against it.\u201cWhether you\u2019re pro-monarchy or not, it is a moment in history, this will go in the history books, you\u2019ll remember where you were at that time. That\u2019s why I thought it would be nice to come out to be with my community.\u201cAt the end of the day he\u2019s been in training for this all of his life and he\u2019s now going to get his chance to be King.\u201cI think he\u2019s going to be a modern person, I loved the Queen, I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s got a bad thing to say about the Queen, she was brilliant, but I think he\u2019s going to try and bring it into modern times.",
        "\u201cHe\u2019s done all of his work for The Prince\u2019s Trust, he\u2019s always been about climate change so I think that\u2019ll be good, that\u2019s a hot topic at the minute.\u201d"
