        "After discussing their love of putting ingredients together to make meals, they got back to cooking their vegan caviar.\u00a0\u00a0They mixed four tablespoons of chia seeds into the bowl before setting the mixture aside for one to two hours to allow the chia seeds to absorb the liquid.The two even made a dairy-free version of cr\u00e8me fraiche to pair with the vegan caviar.To make the\u00a0cr\u00e8me fraiche they used one cup of raw cashews, 1/2 cup of water, 1/4 cup of fresh lime juice, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt.Amy and Lexy began by soaking the cashews in boiling water for about 30 minutes.\u00a0",
        "Then, they added the soft cashews, lime juice, and salt to the blender.\u00a0The duo added water in increments beginning with 1/4 and increased by tablespoons until the mixture reached a creamy consistency.\u00a0",
        "Finally, they were ready to eat their vegan-friendly dish.'I like to prepare for the perfect bite,' the chef said as she spread cr\u00e8me fraiche and the fish-free caviar on a piece of bread.The two pals described their dish as having the 'same flavor' as caviar and rated it a '10 out of 10' because the snack was both healthy and delicious.\u00a0"
