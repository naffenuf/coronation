        "Dialunguna Lema, 26, allegedly stalked model\u00a0Madia Giwa in north LondonMs Giwa declined to come to court as the hearing was listed on her birthdayA YouTuber has been cleared of stalking a plus-size model who refused to give evidence in court as the hearing fell on her birthday.",
        "Dialunguna Lema, 26, was accused of harassing and stalking neighbour Madia Giwa in Crouch End, north London, between May 2021 and June last year by trying to speak to her about his video-streaming channel.Lema denied stalking and harassment and the charges were thrown out when Ms Giwa today failed to turn up to give evidence against him at Highbury Corner Magistrates\u2019 Court on her birthday.Tom Lambert, defending Lema, told the court that the case had gone on long enough. He said: \u2018The overriding objective of this case is not the convenience of the complainant.\u2018We\u2019re here today to have a fair and just trial.\u2018The written reasons given for adjourning were not trauma or long-term memory damage, but because she had birthday plans in place.'",
        "Refusing the application to adjourn, Bench Chair Ms Anna Kaposi said: \u2018We\u2019ve not heard of any steps by the prosecution to secure the attendance of the witness here today.'Ms Giwa\u2019s 6ft 2in friend and fellow model Aeva Andersson was said to have witnessed one of the alleged incidents.Qadeer Mirza, prosecuting, earlier told the court that giving evidence on her birthday would \u2018traumatise every future birthday\u2019 for Ms Giwa.He said: \u2018Ms Giwa did not want to give evidence on her birthday. She\u2019s been harassed and stalked by this man, to such a point that it\u2019s caused her severe distress and anxiety.",
        "\u2018She doesn\u2019t want to give evidence because it will traumatise her. She has other health issues as well. Today her parents fly in from abroad and it\u2019s the only day she will get to stay with her parents.",
        "\u2018She lives alone in the UK and this is the only day she will see her family. She does not know what plans they have made for her birthday, but it is still a family gathering.\u2018The application is simple, giving evidence on her birthday will affect her mental health.\u2018Giving evidence and reliving the incident on her birthday will mean she is traumatised every future birthday.\u2018Any subsequent birthday she will recall what happened in court, because that day is unique to her.\u2018She has various personal medical matters which have affected her mental health. She is currently under safeguarding with a counsellor.\u2018It isn\u2019t just a matter of \u201coh it\u2019s my birthday and I can\u2019t be bothered\u201d - it\u2019s painful.\u2019Summarising the alleged offences, Mr Mirza said: \u2018Remember she lives alone and here we have a grown man.\u2018On May 2021, Ms Giwa states the defendant approached her address out of the blue, knocked on the door and said: \u201cHello, my name is Chris, I have a YouTube channel. Do you live alone?\u201d",
        "\u2018He then stepped inside her property and she had to force him out. She pushed him out - this is someone she never met, someone she doesn\u2019t know.\u2018She shouted \u201cleave me alone\u201d, and he left.\u2018Last year, on March 7, she was woken up to loud banging on the front door. The defendant is there and says: \u201cI want to talk to you\u201d.\u2018He was standing so close that she could see the glass on the door was fogging up from his breath.\u2018She shouted: \u201cWhat are you doing here? Get away from my door. Get away from my door or I\u2019ll call the police.\u201d He then runs away.\u2018Between March 7 and March 14 last year the complainant is at Haringey train station. The defendant walked onto the platform, she walked to the other end of the platform to create some distance from her and the defendant, as much as possible.\u2018Once she arrived at Finsbury Park station, she got off the train and found the defendant on the platform looking at her directly. She decided to ignore him and make way to her final destination.",
        "\u2018She\u2019s walking along Ferme Park Road, N8, between seven and eight in the evening, when a male rushed past her from behind.\u2018He rubbed close to her, he brushed past her. She expresses shock. He turned around and she saw it was the defendant, Chris.",
        "\u2018In another incident on 4 June last year, the complainant Ms Giwa contacts the police. In that call she states the defendant is following her from the communal bins to her flat, then staring at her aggressively making her feel uncomfortable.\u2019Ms Giwa had previously told the Crown Prosecution Service she was unwilling to give evidence on her birthday.The defence lawyer added: \u2018Given that the claimant\u2019s credibility is at issue in this trial, that is something to consider.\u2018If this trial is delayed again there would be further distress caused to Mr Lema.\u2019In making her ruling, Ms Kaposi said the defendant also had rights in the matter.\u00a0She added: \u2018We know it is the fault of the CPS that there was a delay in notifying the court today. The matter is now almost a year old, indeed some of the incidents are a year old.Lema, of Ridge Road, Crouch End, was arrested on July 12 last year.He denied and was cleared of harassment without violence and stalking without causing fear of violence after the prosecution offered no evidence.Ms Kaposi added: \u2018We\u2019re refusing the application for a restraining order. We find it not necessary as we have not heard any clear evidence that the witness needs protection.\u2019",
        "Addressing Lema in the dock, Ms Kaposi said: \u2018You were here for a trial today and that trial is not going to take place. That matter is dismissed and you will hear no more about it.\u2018Your bail conditions are gone and you\u2019re free to go.\u2019"
