        "Senior Tory MP Lee Anderson has drawn ire for telling anti-monarchy activists to \u201cemigrate\u201d rather than exercise their right to protest.",
        "The deputy chairman of the Conservative Party was commenting on dozens of arrests of protesters throughout the King\u2019s coronation day.The Metropolitan Police have faced criticism after more than 50 people were arrested for alleged affray, public nuisance and breach-of-the-peace offences, a move described by human rights organisations as \u201ca dangerous precedent for us as a democratic nation\u201d.But Mr Anderson appeared to side with the police, especially against protesters who were holding up signs reading Not My King near Buckingham Palace.Sharing an article on the arrests on Twitter, Mr Anderson wrote: \u201cNot My King?\u201cIf you do not wish to live in a country that has a monarchy the solution is not to turn up with your silly boards.\u201cThe solution is to emigrate.\u201dCritics on social media condemned his \u201canti-democratic\u201d remarks and pointed out the right to protest peacefully, while others expressed support for his opinion.",
        "Jonathan Harris, a Lib Dem councillor in West Northamptonshire, tweeted: \u201c30 p Lee \u2013 Idiot on display. You took the rights away for British people to live and work across the EU, and forget that great democracies are built on and absolutely allow the right to peaceful protest.\u201dHome Secretary Suella Braverman later praised the police.She tweeted: \u201cI\u2019m incredibly grateful to the police for all their hard work at today\u2019s Coronation celebration to ensure it was safe &amp; passed without incident.\u201d",
        "But Labour\u2019s Jess Phillips, who is a shadow home office minister, wrote: \u201cOur nation and our King is not so fragile as to not be able to take harmless protest of a different view.\u201dLabour former minister Sir Chris Bryant said: \u201cFreedom of speech is the silver thread that runs through a parliamentary constitutional monarchy.\u201dIt is not the first time Mr Anderson, the MP for Ashfield, has proved controversial, having previously called for the return of the death penalty and claiming people on Universal Credit were not in poverty.He has been dubbed \u201c30p Lee\u201d for claiming that meals could be prepared for that sum and suggesting people using food banks could not budget.Mr Anderson recently clashed with Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley over the force\u2019s handling of protests, telling him to \u201cleave his ivory tower\u201d to deal with demonstrators in Westminster.Under the controversial new Public Order Act, protesters who have an object with the intention of using it to \u201clock on\u201d are liable to a fine, with those who block roads facing 12 months in prison."
