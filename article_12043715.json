        "He was speaking to reporters after his arrival at his golf course outside the town of Doonbeg in Co Clare.He was greeted by a line of staff at the hotel and a display of Irish music and dance.Speaking to reporters, he said the staff had \u201cdone a great job\u201d and the course had \u201cbecome a big success\u201d.",
        "Asked by reporters if he would prefer to see the corporation tax being paid by US companies in Ireland, instead being paid in the US, he said: \u201cI won\u2019t answer that question in your country, a lot of people would say yes.\u201cBut Ireland has done a good job, you\u2019ve lured a lot of companies in.\u201cThey love it here, they really love it here.\u201cThey\u2019ve been treated well just like I\u2019ve been treated well.\u201cThis has been a great success.\u201dMr Trump downplayed the significance of difficulties the Doonbeg development has encountered with planning authorities in Ireland.\u201cWhat we\u2019ve wanted to do I think they\u2019ve pretty much let us to do, the important things,\u201d he said.He also said the impasse over post-Brexit trading arrangements in Northern Ireland was a \u201ctough one\u201d.Asked for his view on the issue, he said: \u201cWell we\u2019re going to see, they\u2019re negotiating and we\u2019re going to see, there are a lot of negotiations going on in Ireland and other other places right now, but it\u2019s going be a tough one,\u201d he said.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s not an easy one. We have to work it out.\u201dAmong those applauding Mr Trump\u2019s arrival, was supporter Tadhg O\u2019Shaughnessy.Wearing a MAGA hat and carrying a fan-made portrait of the former president riding a horse, Mr O\u2019Shaughnessy said being a Trump supporter was like \u201cbeing a fan of Elvis\u201d.\u201cHe\u2019s a truly good person and people keep putting him down.\u201cHe\u2019s a business person, not a politician. He has in his heart the love for his country and he wants the very best of it.\u201dMr Trump landed at Shannon Airport in the west of Ireland after flying on a Boeing 757 with Trump livery.Garda members from the Armed Support Unit were on standby ahead of his arrival, while what appeared to be members of the Secret Service were seen arriving in black cars near the entrance to the airport\u2019s apron.Mr Trump, accompanied by his son Eric, had been in Scotland since Monday, breaking ground on a new golf course at his Menie Estate near Aberdeen before playing a round at his Turnberry resort in South Ayrshire.",
        "He continued his visit by inspecting his resort at Trump International Golf Links and Hotel just outside the town of Doonbeg in Co Clare.Mr Trump last visited the 400-acre resort, which he bought in 2014, while president in 2019.",
        "A heightened garda presence was visible around the resort and neighbouring towns and villages, including armed patrol units.The trip is Mr Trump\u2019s first abroad since he became the first former US president to face criminal charges.No travel conditions were placed on him after he pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records in New York in April.The visit coincides with the second week of a civil trial in Manhattan over accusations, denied by Mr Trump, he raped former magazine columnist E Jean Carroll in a department store dressing room in 1996.Mr Trump will stay overnight at the hotel and said he expects to play golf at the course on Thursday.He is expected to return to the US later that day.Representatives from the business community in Doonbeg were also present to greet the former president.They have broadly welcomed what they see as a positive economic boost to the town, generated by the Trump organisation\u2019s golf course.Other supporters have travelled to the village in the hopes of meeting Mr Trump.Among them, the self-proclaimed biggest Irish supporter of the former president.David Grange, from Raheny in Dublin, said he would like to shake Mr Trump\u2019s hand but expected it would not be possible with the increased security.",
        "\u201cI love the guy,\u201d he said.Carrying a US flag and a Trump Make America Great Again election flag, he said he drove down to west Clare especially for the former president.Asked why he supported Mr Trump, he said: \u201cAll his policies, promises made, promises kept.\u201cThe witch hunt against him, the attack against him.\u201cEverything he\u2019s done has ticked all the boxes, everywhere he goes there\u2019s a mass following.\u201cI think the media give him an unfair deal.\u201dHe described legal proceedings against Mr Trump as a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d."
