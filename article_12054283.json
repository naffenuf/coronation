The wreckage from the car scattered over 50 metres.'Prilepin is a\u00a0pro-Kremlin novelist turned politician who joined fighters in the war, having been attacked just after a visit to the Donbas -\u00a0\u00a0Russian-occupied eastern Ukraine.The 47-year-old is a strong supporter of the Z-slogan used by Putin supporters to demonstrate their backing of the war.He had also been there at the time when Hollywood actor Steven Seagal joined a pro-Kremlin party nearly two years ago.In 2018, Russia tasked Seagal with improving humanitarian ties with the US at a time when relations between the two countries had begun to deteriorate.",
        "Prior to today's incident, there was some suggestion that Prilepin's car had been tailed, with neighbours also allegedly reporting a\u00a0suspicious 'bearded man' and an unregistered car in the area.A video from the scene showed severe damage to writer's upturned torn-open car and a huge hole in the ground.\u00a0Mash media reported that the victim's car was in the vicinity of an anti-tank mine, sparking the catastrophic explosion.'The car was literally torn in half, and tossed in the air.

        "Today, the Russian foreign ministry immediately put blame on the West for Prilepin's injuries.A criminal case has also now been opened.\u00a0'The direct responsibility of the United States and Britain. We pray for Zakhar,' said spokeswoman Maria Zakharova.",

The extent of his direct combat involvement is not clear.Prilepin has been politically active as the co-chair of the 'A Just Russia - For Truth' party. Last year he took a prominent role in creating GRAD, a parliamentary group that seeks to identify cultural figures with 'anti-Russian' views and persuade the state and business to stop funding them. GRAD's initials stand for 'Group to investigate anti-Russian activity in the cultural sphere.' Grad is also the Russian word for 'hail', and the name of a missile system.Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine last February, he has been sanctioned by Switzerland, Britain, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the European Union.\u00a0The pro-Putin ideologist had also been there at the time when Hollywood actor Steven Seagal joined a pro-Kremlin party nearly two years ago.In 2018, Russia tasked Seagal with improving humanitarian ties with the US at a time when relations between the two countries had began to deteriorate."
