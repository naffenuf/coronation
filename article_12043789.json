        "I'm A Celebrity viewers were left in stitches during Thursday's episode as Dean Gaffney repeatedly vomited during a gruesome drinking challenge.",
        "The former EastEnders star, 45, got more than he bargained for when he was greeted with a mixture of animal penis and vagina which made him gag before he even took a gulp.Dean quickly threw up the revolting mixture - and hilariously insisted he hadn't got sick - as hosts Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly howled with laughter.The trial - which Dean completed with fellow new arrival Joe Swash - went down a treat with viewers who proclaimed it one of the best Bushtucker Trials ever.One viewer proclaimed: 'That trial with Joe &amp; Dean is hands down the best trial ever. Dean's entry trial when he was first in it was always my fave, but this was better.'",
        "Another said: 'That has to be the funniest but most disgusting trial I've ever seen.\u00a0 Dean Gaffney and Joe Swash too funny together.'A third wrote: 'Watching Dean and Joe do that trial has put me off my tea,' while a fourth added: 'Well done Dean and Joe. Brilliant trial.'A fifth said: 'The highlight of my day [was] watching Dean Gaffney projectile vomit a cow penis smoothie.'Another added: 'Ant asking Dean if the blended chicken testicles is chickeny so he vomits again is insane television.'\u00a0\u00a0Dean and Joe were late arrivals to camp on Wednesday's episode and had to complete the trial to win treats for their fellow campmates.\u00a0",
        "Former I'm A Celebrity winner Joe, 41, was voted champion by the public on his first run on the series in 2008.Dean took part in the 2006 series where he finished in fifth place.It comes after Amir Khan was voted off I'm A Celebrity\u00a0during Tuesday's show.",
        "The 36-year-old sports star became the third celebrity to leave the ITV show, after being voted off in a secret ballot.Before announcing the latest departure, Dec told the campmates: 'You all know why we\u2019re here this morning - last night we left you with the news that someone would be leaving camp as a result of a secret ballot...'Amir was then announced as the latest celebrity to leave the camp.The former boxer - who retired from the sport in 2022 - insisted appearing on the show has been one of the 'best experiences' of his life.However, Amir also admitted that he felt ready to leave the camp and return home to his family.",
        "He said: 'It was one of the best experiences I\u2019ve ever had. It\u2019s like I got to be with a new family in South Africa.'I\u2019m always going to compare it with my first time in Australia but this one, for me, was way better. Great camp, the campmates were amazing.",
        "'Even though I would have loved to have stayed in a little bit longer, sometimes what can happen is, if you stay longer, you can outstay your welcome.'It was just a great experience and I\u2019m just glad I had the opportunity.'"
