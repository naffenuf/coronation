I'm in agony with my back and my hips \u2013 I have arthritis in my hips.'I've suffered with the pain for a long time, but it's been worse over the past few days. It's like my body knows I have time off work so it shuts down.",

And my god it really really hurts.'",

Like in so much pain.'Imagine a fly, and you want to pull its wings off, that's what I want you to do, pull my legs off, that's the pain I've been feeling, it's been horrendous. Horrendous. I had a massage, and I could not move. So I have literally stayed in bed.Kerry has previously admitted to struggling with the condition and was\u00a0diagnosed with arthritis in 2021 after 13 years of unexplained chronic pain.At the time she announced the diagnosis to her followers admitting she was 'over the moon' to finally know what was wrong.",

        "Arthritis is a common condition that causes pain and inflammation in a joint.In the UK, millions of people have arthritis or other, similar conditions that affect the joints.Arthritis affects people of all ages, including children.Types of arthritisOsteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis are the 2 most common types of arthritis.OsteoarthritisOsteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis in the UK.It most often develops in people in their mid-40s or older.It's also more common in women and people with a family history of the condition.But it can occur at any age as a result of an injury or be associated with other joint-related conditions, such as gout or rheumatoid arthritis.Osteoarthritis initially affects the smooth cartilage lining of the joint. This makes movement more difficult than usual, leading to pain and stiffness.Once the cartilage lining starts to roughen and thin out, the tendons and ligaments have to work harder.This can cause swelling and the formation of bony spurs called osteophytes.Severe loss of cartilage can lead to bone rubbing on bone, altering the shape of the joint and forcing the bones out of their normal position.The most commonly affected joints are those in the:handsspinekneeshipsRheumatoid arthritisRheumatoid arthritis is less common than osteoarthritis.It often starts when a person is between 30 and 50 years old. Women are more likely to be affected than men.In rheumatoid arthritis, the body's immune system targets affected joints, which leads to pain and swelling.The outer covering (synovium) of the joint is the first place affected.This can then spread across the joint, leading to further swelling and a change in the joint's shape. This may cause the bone and cartilage to break down.People with rheumatoid arthritis can also develop problems with other tissues and organs in their body."
