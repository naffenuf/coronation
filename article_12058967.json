        "Laws giving police greater powers to detain protesters must be repealed, an anti-monarchy campaigner has demanded after his arrest alongside other demonstrators at the coronation.",
        "Republic chief executive Graham Smith dismissed as \u201cdisgraceful\u201d suggestions that the dozens of arrests were needed to limit disruption to people wanting to enjoy the celebrations.Scotland Yard made 64 arrests on the King\u2019s coronation day, with 46 people bailed after being detained on suspicion of causing a public nuisance or breaching the peace.Mr Smith raised fresh concerns about the Public Order Act signed into law last week, which tips the balance against protest including by lowering the definition of \u201cserious disruption\u201d.",
        "Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer defended the Metropolitan Police as having got the \u201cbalance right\u201d and said arrests were necessary during the \u201cinternational event on the world stage\u201d.But Mr Smith told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cThat\u2019s a disgraceful suggestion and quite frankly this is a political issue and therefore obviously it\u2019s going to face protest.\u201cYou cannot say that they have to enjoy a party and therefore other people should be arrested.\u201dHe said he was arrested on Saturday unloading placards on the suspicion of being equipped to \u201clock-on\u201d to an object or building, which the Public Order Act made a jailable offence.Mr Smith denies this was his intention and believes the Met had every intention of arresting them and used some unfeasible straps as a \u201cpretext\u201d.",
        "\u201cThe whole thing was a deliberate attempt to disrupt and diminish our protest,\u201d he said.\u201cThey stopped us because the law was introduced, rushed in last week, to give them the powers to stop us on any flimsy pretext. I understand the Labour Party said they wouldn\u2019t repeal this law, which is pretty disgraceful if true, this law needs to be repealed  Graham Smith, Republic  \u201cThat law means we no longer in this country have the right to protest, we only have the freedom to protest contingent on the permission of senior police officers and politicians and it\u2019s my view that those senior police officers were under immense pressure from politicians.\u201cI understand the Labour Party said they wouldn\u2019t repeal this law, which is pretty disgraceful if true, this law needs to be repealed.\u201dLabour frontbencher Andrew Gwynne said the Act gave \u201cdisproportionate\u201d powers to the police but declined to commit the party to repealing it if it enters government.Instead the shadow public health minister told Sky News: \u201cI think the next Labour government will look very carefully at this legislation.\u201dMr Gwynne defended the right to protest and suggested revellers supporting the coronation should have drowned out the dissent.\u201cThat would\u2019ve been the appropriate approach to drown out those that wanted to protest rather than maybe heavy-handed practice that some have suggested may have taken place,\u201d he said.",
        " Protesting can take place in this country but it\u2019s the level to which you want to perform that protest that we have to balance and deal with what\u2019s put in front of us impartially. That\u2019s what was done  Ken Marsh, Metropolitan Police Federation  Ken Marsh, head of the Metropolitan Police Federation representing officers from the rank of constable to chief inspector, said police were acting \u201cimpartially\u201d on the powers they have.\u201cProtesting can take place in this country but it\u2019s the level to which you want to perform that protest that we have to balance and deal with what\u2019s put in front of us impartially. That\u2019s what was done,\u201d he told Today.Westminster City Council has raised concerns that women\u2019s safety volunteers were among those arrested after rape alarms were seized.The Met said it had received intelligence that people were planning to use the devices to disrupt the procession.Caroline Russell said the London Assembly\u2019s Police and Crime Committee that she chairs will be questioning the Met over the \u201cworrying\u201d arrests. It felt like for someone who was trying to protest, and trying to do it by the book, it was very difficult to understand what the rules were  Green politician Caroline Russell, London Assembly  The Green politician told Today: \u201cIt felt like for someone who was trying to protest, and trying to do it by the book, it was very difficult to understand what the rules were.",
        "\u201cIt seems absolutely extraordinary that those people who were volunteering, they were out there handing out flip flops to people who could no longer walk in their high heels because they\u2019d had a bit too much to drink and handing out rape alarms. It just seems extraordinary that they got caught up in the Met\u2019s safety net. How? It just feels very odd.\u201dIn total the Met made 64 arrests during the coronation day.Four charges have been brought, including over a religiously aggravated public order allegation and class A drugs possession.London Mayor Sadiq Khan has demanded \u201cclarity\u201d from the force\u2019s leaders on the arrests."
