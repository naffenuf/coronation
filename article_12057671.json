        "And the King laughed even harder after she referred to him as \u201cKing Charlesy Warlesy\u201d and said he was \u201cexpecting\u201d Kermit the Frog in the royal box.Even Princess Charlotte and Prince George smiled as they watched on intently, while the Prince of Wales laughed along with his father.Just before Hugh Bonneville introduced the final act of the star-studded concert, Take That, the BBC cut to the royal box, where Kermit waved a Union flag in front of a grinning Duke of Edinburgh.The King looked to his left as he clapped before Bonneville signed off: \u201cAnd, of course, thank you your majesties, for allowing us to perform for you here. We sincerely hope you and the frog have enjoyed yourselves.\u201d",
        "The camera then showed a wide view of the royal box, with Charles and Camilla smiling while Kermit nodded.As Take That performed their first show in four years, several members of the royal family got to their feet, including the King and Queen, while George and Charlotte enthusiastically waved their Union flags.",
        "The Muppets characters were among dozens of iconic figures who appeared throughout the concert, including Tom Cruise, who said in a video message from his Top Gun plane: \u201cPilot to pilot. Your Majesty, you can be my wingman any time,\u201d before saluting and banking off.",
