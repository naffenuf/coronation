        "Half a million Britons suffer from Crohn's disease which can cause extreme painAbout a fifth of these patients can keep symptoms under control with drugsScores of Britons with a debilitating bowel disease are missing out on \u2018life-changing\u2019 surgery that can put their chronic illness into remission, experts fear.",
        "About half a million Britons suffer with Crohn\u2019s disease, which causes agonising pain, diarrhoea, exhaustion and extreme weight loss.For about a fifth of patients, the condition, where the gut lining becomes inflamed, can be kept under control with medication.But for the vast majority the drugs won\u2019t keep the disease at bay for long, and they will eventually require an operation to remove damaged portions of their bowel.According to guidelines set by NHS watchdog the National Institute For Health And Care Excellence (NICE), surgery should be considered \u2018as an alternative to medical treatment early in the course of the disease\u2019.",
        "However, experts have warned that this isn\u2019t happening and that doctors don\u2019t offer the procedure unless all other options have failed \u2013 by which time the damage to the bowel is more complex and harder to treat.\u2018For a lot of patients, the drugs will stop working effectively within a year or so,\u2019 says Dr Nilofer Husnoo, an expert in Crohn\u2019s disease based at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. \u2018And the longer they wait for surgery, the worse the damage to the gut. This makes the condition more difficult to treat in the long term.\u2018The norm for doctors is focusing on medication, but patients end up suffering more.\u2019",
        "Instead of offering surgery when two or three medicines have failed, Dr Husnoo says, in some cases an operation should be given as the first or second treatment.\u2018There are some patients for whom surgery wouldn\u2019t be too complex and could grant them big chunks of time in remission,\u2019 she adds. \u2018These are young people who have busy, active lives \u2013 we have to give them the best chance.\u2019",
        "One 2013 analysis by experts at Leeds Teaching Hospital NHS Trust found that Crohn\u2019s surgery rates had halved since 2003.Yet studies show that when surgery is given early in the disease \u2013 after trying just one or two medications \u2013 three-quarters of patients don\u2019t require medication for the following five years.\u2018People are often worried about having surgery, but once they do they find it is life changing,\u2019 says Ruth Wakeman, director of services, advocacy and evidence at the charity Crohn\u2019s &amp; Colitis UK. \u2018Patients often wish they\u2019d had it done earlier.\u2018It is really important that surgery is not seen as a last option.\u2019Crohn\u2019s disease, for which there is no cure, is mainly diagnosed in adults in their 20s or 30s. The most common type is called ileocolitis, where the damage affects the end of the small intestines and the large intestine, or colon.",
        "On top of the pain and exhaustion, Crohn\u2019s sufferers usually struggle to absorb enough nutrients from regular diets. The exact cause of the disease is unknown, but it is thought that a genetic fault leads the immune system to attack healthy gut tissue. It has historically been treated using immuno-suppressant drugs to dampen the immune system and reduce the inflammation.But over the past 20 years, more powerful drugs called biologics have emerged which block the proteins in the body that lead to inflammation. It means surgery \u2013 known as a bowel resection \u2013 is now seen as a more risky alternative.In a small number of cases, the operation can lead to patients ending up with a stoma \u2013 where the bowel is diverted out of the body on the abdomen and replaced with a bag.Dr Husnoo says it is a shame that concerns about this outcome often puts patients off having surgery. \u2018Surgery now is very different to surgery 20 years ago,\u2019 she says. \u2018Thanks to new, minimally invasive techniques and specialist surgeons, it is rare to fit a stoma these days. And if all goes well, the patient will usually be out of hospital within five days. Even if patients do have a stoma, it is generally temporary and can be reversed a few months later.",
        "\u2018All of these developments make it a more attractive option now than it would have been years ago, but the stigma around surgery perhaps hasn\u2019t gone yet.\u2019One patient who waited four years to have a bowel resection operation is 31-year-old Charlotte Hartill, a dental nurse from Plymouth.Following her diagnosis in 2010, she went through six drugs in an effort to keep her flare-ups under control. Every two to three months, a treatment would stop working.\u2018They weren\u2019t doing anything,\u2019 she says. \u2018I was in pain for months and months and constantly in the bathroom.\u2019As a result, Charlotte lost two stone and suffered serious side effects, including a swollen pancreas and the skin condition psoriasis. She eventually went back to her specialist nurse for help.\u2018She examined me, conducted tests and said I needed urgent surgery,\u2019 Charlotte adds.In 2014 she underwent the operation to remove the damaged area of her bowel.\u2018I got my quality of life back,\u2019 she says. \u2018If I\u2019d done it earlier, I probably wouldn\u2019t have needed to go through so many different treatments. I wish I had considered surgery a couple of years earlier \u2013 it\u2019s given me a fresh start.\u2019"
