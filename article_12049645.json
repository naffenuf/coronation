        "Model Farmers kicked off with a bang, trading the lush pastures their photo studio for the rugged charm of an Aussie outback sheep station.",
        "The show's new farmhands?\u00a0None other than a motley crew of six Australian OnlyFans creators, swapping their high-glam lifestyles for two weeks of gruelling, sheep-dung-scented reality.This week's episode thrust us into a veritable whirlpool of chaos as the pink team, composed of Natty Zach, Henny Moody, and the Laidlaw sisters, Kate and Bec, who found themselves in a heated tussle over a seemingly simple task: Round up the goats and load them onto the livestock trailers.Who knew a manual gearbox could evoke such passions?\u00a0The four models struggled reversing the car before they got into a heated argument while trying to work out how to reverse the manual truck.",
        "The team initially struggled to decide who would be best suited for a driving task, eventually settling on Natty.However, the task turned out to be more challenging than anticipated, with the team grappling to maneuver a manual transmission vehicle.With a blend of tension and humour, the episode showed the team repeatedly stalling the car, struggling to get it out of neutral, and into reverse.",
        "Despite the motivating cheers from the team, Natty struggled with the manual vehicle, which created a sense of frustration and urgency.Recognising that their efforts weren't yielding results and conscious of their ticking clock, the team decided to change tack.",
        "The decision to bring in Farmer Dick for the driving challenge resulted in a swift and efficient resolution, showcasing the importance of acknowledging one's limitations and making pragmatic decisions in a time-sensitive situation.",
        "The second part of the series introduced a new challenge: dealing with goats.After a previous episode where the blue team had lost some goats, the pink team was extra cautious, making sure not to repeat the same mistake.The episode concluded on a cliffhanger, with the team's plan to move 34 out of the 40 goats remaining ambiguous.Meanwhile, the Blue team (Lara Gya, Phoebe Thompson, Millie Fuller) challenged to put their beauty skills to the test, not on each other, but on one of Mount Gibson's highland cows.",
        "The aim was to transform the muddy beast into a selfie-ready, 'Insta-worthy' heifer - an unusual task that resulted in both hilarity and escalating tensions among the girls.\u00a0The team were equipped with an array of 'clean and green' beauty products, including udder oil and hoof paint, and given a 45-minute window to complete the taskThe idea was not only to clean the cow but also to accentuate her natural features for a radiant 'glow up.'\u00a0",
        "The competition started on a light-hearted note with jokes about the cow's 'big night out,' but the task proved more challenging than anticipated.",
        "Despite dealing with the less glamorous aspects of the task, like removing stuck-on muck from the cow's tail area, the girls maintained a sense of humour throughout.The team showed commendable grit, with Lara even using her sturdy acrylic nails to assist in the more stubborn spots.\u00a0",
        "The result was a cow that looked so cute that it evoked the same kind of admiration typically reserved for a beautiful woman, with the cow humorously dubbed 'Reba.'\u00a0While the end result was a picture-perfect heifer, the competition between the girls is intensifying.Model Farmers is available to be streamed on OnlyFans TV here.\u00a0"
