        "The widow of a soldier killed in a double IRA bomb attack 50 years ago said she has lived with profound sadness ever since.",
        "Trooper John Gibbons, 22, from the 17/21st Lancers Regiment, died in the attack near Crossmaglen, Co Armagh, on May 5, 1973.The attack also killed Sergeant Major William Vines, 36, based in Aldershot, and Corporal Terence Williams, 35, from Kent.Mr Gibbons, who was originally from Edinburgh, had a three-month-old son when he died. As a family we were absolutely devastated by his murder and we have lived with a profound sadness for five decades  Linda McHugh  His widow Linda McHugh said: \u201cJohn joined the Army in 1969. He was so proud of his Scottish ancestry and the fact that he served his country.\u201cWe lived in Germany and we had a son who was only three months old at the time of John\u2019s murder.\u201cIn fact, John left for his tour of duty in Northern Ireland when his son was only two weeks old.\u201dMs McHugh said: \u201cAs a family we were absolutely devastated by his murder and we have lived with a profound sadness for five decades.\u201cJohn was a good man and he was motivated to do his part in making life better for others.\u201cI will never understand the hate and lack of care for human life that some are capable of.\u201cJohn\u2019s life was never for others to steal away.",
        "\u201cWe remember him today and every day as well as Terence and William, and are conscious that their families are experiencing the same heartache as ours.\u201d",
        "Kenny Donaldson, director of services at the victims\u2019 organisation South East Fermanagh Foundation (SEFF), said Mr Vines had been killed by an initial IRA bomb while Mr Williams and Mr Gibbons died in a second explosion while investigating the first attack.He said: \u201cThis tragic incident brought about a review of Army policy and the dealing with the aftermath of primary bombings, followed by secondary attacks.\u201cSadly, however, there were many others beyond this point who were also murdered through secondary bomb attacks.\u201cThis is one of the many horrific acts of terrorism perpetrated against the Army in the area; those who perished are still remembered by some of us.\u201dMr Donaldson also said a war pension for Ms McHugh was removed when she remarried.He said: \u201cLinda remarried years beyond John\u2019s murder and in doing so the state removed her war pension, an act of further injustice.\u201cTo this day, the matter has yet to be resolved despite the Ministry of Defence recommending resolution and substantive reparations to be made to those 270-300 war widows and widowers impacted.\u201d"
