        "Former NRL star Jarryd Hayne was found guilty of sexual assault last monthHis wife was not in court to support her husband on MondayHayne will be sentenced on Friday by Judge Graham Turnbull SCThe wife of disgraced NRL player and rapist Jarryd Hayne has not fronted court to support her husband, with lawyers saying it's because of the attention she has received as a result of her husband's conviction.",
        "Hayne appeared in the NSW District Court on Monday dressed in his prison greens and sporting a thick beard.The 35-year-old former Dally M winner was found guilty in April of two counts of sexual assault without consent relating to an incident at the Newcastle home of the woman on the night of the NRL grand final in 2018.While Hayne claims the sexual encounter was entirely consensual, the jury accepted the woman's version of events that she repeatedly said 'no' and 'stop'.The jury was told the woman refused to consent to sex because the ex-Parramatta fullback had a taxi waiting outside.",
        "Hayne's wife Amellia Bonnici did not appear in court to support him, but watched the proceedings via videolink.It was the first time Hayne has been seen in public after he was sensationally taken into custody during a Supreme Court detention application on April 14.Hayne's defence barrister, Margaret Cunneen SC, told the court Ms Bonnici did not appear on Monday to support her husband as the publicity has had an 'exceptional effect' on the family.Judge Graham Turnbull SC said it was the 'same for so many people' who are incarcerated.'They committed a crime, they have to be punished,' the judge said.Ms Cunneen agreed while it was true, the publicity around Hayne's case was so bad Ms Bonnici 'had chosen not to be here today'.",
        "'I'm instructed she continues to support, it's just been too much with the photographs taken of the children and herself,' the court heard.'The media has been extremely negative about this and the social media has been appalling [...] the attacks were for Mr Hayne and to his wife.'",
        "A fresh victim impact statement was read to the court on behalf of the victim on Monday by Crown prosecutor John Sfinas, where the woman said her life has been a 'never-ending nightmare' since September 30, 2018.'I still don't know how to put any of this into words,' the statement read.'From the 30th of September 2018, my life has been launched into what feels like a never-ending nightmare.'The woman said she was hoping she could 'finally try to move on' with her life at the end of the second trial.But she said she hadn't had the chance to \"move on or feel peace\" and had to relive the trauma 'over and over'.'Those types of things don't just hurt, the assault was something horrible that happened to me, something I feel that was very private,' the victim wrote.The victim told the court that she had since been 'extremely insecure' about her body.'In September it will be five years since this has happened. I was a 26-year-old with the world at her feet, now I am nearly 31 and haven't been able to finish uni,' the woman said.",
        "'I am stronger, I am wiser, but I am damaged and I won't ever be the same person.'In a previous victim impact statement from 2021, the court heard victim said she felt 'shameful' for letting someone she didn't know into her house.The woman had also been feeling guilty for sending Hayne to prison: 'The thought of being part of taking away someone's daddy made me sick but I kept telling myself this is not my fault'.Hayne's defence barrister told the court the sexual assault was 'a matter of minutes' at most.Ms Cunneen said the length of the offending was important in the context of the case and would affect the objective seriousness.Ms Cunneen told the court that there was 'unambiguous and mutual sexual context' in the lead-up to Hayne raping the woman.'Not only was there an unambiguous sexual flavour to it [...] there was talk about f**king by the complainant,' Ms Cunneen told the court.She said the act occurred between 'two grown adults'.'The victim knew who Jarryd Hayne was and that was the reason she urged him to come over,' Ms Cunneen said.She told the court Hayne had suffered through 'onerous' conditions during his prior time in custody, where he couldn't see his family for six months.",
        "Hayne is also suffering as he is in isolation while in custody awaiting his sentence on Friday.The court heard he is only allowed out of his cell, which is only three metres by four metres, for up to 25 minutes a day and is only allowed to walk and read his bible.Ms Cunneen said Hayne is a 'very different man' to the man who committed the offences in 2018.'He doesn't possess the personality and thought patterns and sexual arousal patterns of a sex offender, and also because of his life which has turned around considerably since the hiatus in the relationship with his now wife,' Ms Cunneen said.'There is eloquent testament of Mr Hayne's pastor of his committed to his Christian faith.'The court heard Hayne had an 'extraordinary loss' in regards to his 'stellar' career, leading to him being 'publicly vilified' which has impacted his opportunity of being employed.Crown prosecutor Mr Sfinas rejected the submission made by the defence that communications between the victim and Hayne were unambiguous.Mr Sfinas told the court the Crown submits there was an \"unambiguous lack of consent\" in the offending.The court heard there 'would have been a significant degree of fear engendered in the victim'.'It was in her home, in her bedroom [...] it's a significant aggravating factor,' Mr Sfinas said.",
        "'The complainant weighed 48kilograms while Mr Hayne weighed 104kilograms.'Mr Sfinas said there was fairly distinct phases of force leading the victim to say she was fearful after the offending occurred.The court heard the victim now looks back and thinks she was 'stupid to think the way she did'.",
        "The Crown rejected Ms Cunneen's claims about duration lowering the objective seriousness of the offence, saying conduct occurred 'before, during and after' the 30 second assault.After five years, three trials, an appeal and nine months in prison, Hayne was found guilty on April 4 of sexually assaulting the woman at her Newcastle home in 2018.It was the third time Hayne faced a trial over the same incident and the second time he was found guilty.Judge Turnbull will sentence Hayne on Friday."
