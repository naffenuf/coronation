        "Lawyers say the proposals would breach an accused\u2019s right to a fair trial\u00a0Plans for juryless rape trials are in disarray after lawyers in Scotland\u2019s two biggest cities vowed to boycott the scheme.\u00a0",
        "Lawyers say Scottish Government proposals for a pilot scheme for judge-only trials would breach an accused\u2019s right to a fair trial.\u00a0Now the bar associations in Glasgow and Edinburgh have said they will not take part, which could scupper the initiative entirely.\u00a0The proposed move was contained in SNP legislation published last week, which also paves the way for the abolition of the not proven verdict.\u00a0The Glasgow Bar Association said the result of a recent survey of members was \u2018overwhelmingly in favour of boycotting the single-judge pilot court\u2019.\u00a0",
        "It said it was now looking at whether a \u2018national position and strategy can be agreed\u2019.\u00a0The Edinburgh Bar Association also voted to boycott the pilot. It added: \u2018Trial by jury is a cornerstone of our justice system.\u2019\u00a0Several other bar associations have said they will be boycotting the scheme or balloting members about participation.\u00a0William McIntyre, a solicitor and crime writer, said: \u2018I don\u2019t know of any member firm of Falkirk and District Faculty of Solicitors that would be prepared to act in a juryless rape trial. I would go as far as to say the same for the Stirling and Alloa Faculties.\u2019\u00a0There around 530 members in total for Glasgow and Edinburgh Bar Associations.\u00a0It is understood that after the pilot, the Scottish Government will give judges a \u2018report card\u2019 and review the trials.\u00a0",
        "Success or failure will be measured by the number of convictions, bringing judicial independence into question and meaning those found guilty could appeal on the grounds their trial was not free of influence.\u00a0Thomas Ross, KC, a critic of the plans, said: \u2018The judiciary must have guarantees against outside pressures but the pilot scheme proposes the exact opposite.\u2019Scottish Tory justice spokesman Jamie Greene said:\u00a0\u2018The SNP Government must fully engage with victims and the legal profession if they want to introduce long-lasting, beneficial judicial reforms.\u2019\u00a0Justice Secretary Angela Constance said: \u2018We have worked closely with the legal sector and will continue to do so during the development and evaluation of the pilot.\u2019\u00a0"
