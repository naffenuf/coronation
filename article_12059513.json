        "Kym Marsh was seen for the first time since the dissolution of her marriage was reported, as she stepped out on Sunday.\u00a0",
        "The former Hear'Say star, 46, cut a low-key figure during a day out with her supportive daughter Emilie, 26, in the wake of the news that she has split from her soldier husband Scott Ratcliff, 34, after 19 months of marriage.Last week it was reported by\u00a0The Sun, that Kym and Scott decided to end their marriage due to the strain of work, but 'cracks' had been present for some time.Kym, who spoke in the past of the 'grim' reality of being an army wife, flitted between looking pensive and laughing with the group as they stepped out with her blingy engagement and wedding ring notably absent.\u00a0While Kym was still sporting a very thin band on her ring finger, her engagement ring and chunky diamond wedding band were no longer on her hand.\u00a0",
        "It comes after it was reported Kym split from her third husband Scott after\u00a0they married at a lavish ceremony in October 2021.\u00a0After 19 months as husband and wife, they are said to have broken up following a trial separation, due to work keeping them apart.A source told The Sun: 'They both really tried to make it work, but the cracks have been there for a while and they were only getting to see each other for one or two days a week at the very most.",
        "'Kym's been so busy, and last year (being on Strictly Come Dancing) meant even her weekends were stacked up along with weekdays rehearsing.'More recently she's been filming all over the place and rehearsing for a new theatre run.'",
        "Adding about how Army Major Scott's work drove a wedge between him and Kym, the insider said: 'Scott is based in barracks down south \u2013 he's got a very busy career as well. Kym's still a working mum, too, and lives up in Cheshire with her family.\u00a0'In the end it was the fact they lived so far away from each\u00a0other that just made it impossible.'The source said the pair 'had a trial separation earlier this year' and were 'hoping to get things back on track', but added they have decided 'it's best to go their separate ways'.They added: 'It's very sad for all involved, but they've decided it's time to tell their family and friends and focus on the future \u2013 which means filing for divorce. They're hoping to keep things as amicable as possible.'Hopefully time will help to heal things.'",
        "In January last year, Kym revealed that two days after their wedding in October 2021 he was sent away for a fortnight - something she 'was not expecting' and branded life as an army wife 'pretty grim' due to the distance.\u00a0",
        "As well as the stress of their distance, she admitted the danger of his job added to the problem as she was worried about war.\u00a0She said: 'There is always anxiety, it is always stressful when he goes away. There may not be an actual war threat currently but there's always a risk when you're in these dangerous places.'As well as her assessment of the distance in their lives, she also spoke about how Strictly exacerbated her anxiety - with training falling in line with Scott's time away with the Parachute Regiment - leaving the couple barely seeing one another.\u00a0",
        "Speaking to OK! in January 2022, she said: 'It's been really good. Well, I say that, but we got married and then two days later Scott was sent away for two weeks and we weren't expecting that! That was a bit grim, but it's just part of being an army wife...'It felt like on the honeymoon I could properly celebrate being Mrs Ratcliff!'Scott detailed why he had to leave his new wife for work so soon after the wedding, adding: 'I do three terms per year at (military academy) Sandhurst and every term I'll go away for two weeks to run an overseas training exercise.'Aside from her life as an army WAG, she also spoke about how her time on Strictly increased her anxiety - just four months before her split was announced.\u00a0",
