        "Sir Bryn Terfel performed the first-ever Welsh language song at a Coronation\u00a0CORONATION LIVEBLOG: Click here to follow live updates throughout today\u00a0\u00a0How are YOU celebrating the Coronation? Send your pictures and videos to pictures@mailonline.co.uk\u00a0Viewers watching King Charles III's Coronation were forced to double-take during the ceremony when a Welsh opera singer appeared to be the spitting image of Ed Balls.",
        "As the historic service at Westminster Abbey got under way, Welsh language piece Kyrie Eleison was sung by\u00a0bass-baritone Sir Bryn Terfel, alongside a choir.It marked the first-ever Welsh language performance at a coronation, in a fitting tribute to Charles' former role as the Prince of Wales.But while Sir Bryn, 57, sang the beautiful song, described as a 'cry from the deep soul of the hills and valleys of Wales', viewers were in stitches over a striking resemblance between him and the former Labour education secretary, who served under Gordon Brown's government from 2007 to 2010.",
        "One person said: 'Why is Ed Balls singing at the coronation?'A second wrote: 'Lost my glasses and proper thought that was @edballs singing #Coronation'.Another added: 'Fair play to Ed balls . Didn\u2019t know he could sing. #KingsCoronation'.A fourth joked: 'Ed Balls was wasted on Strictly #Coronation'.Meanwhile, another chimed in: ' First dancing on Strictly and now singing at the Coronation, who knew was so talented!!'",
        "Ahead of the Coronation, the celebrated Welsh bass-baritone said he was looking forward to giving Wales 'a platform' and saw it as an opportunity to promote the Welsh language.Speaking to BBC Cymru Fyw ahead of the occasion, he said: 'The piece is to be sung in Welsh.",
        "'That is my mindset every time I work with the Royal Family, that it is related to Wales.'It's also a platform for the Welsh language once again'.Sir Bryn, who was born in Gwynedd, Wales, started started singing at eisteddfod competitions from the age of four but his career has taken him all over the world.He won Grammy Awards for his album Opera Arias in 1996 and his crossover CD Simple Gifts a decade later.\u00a0He became the second recipient of the Queen's Medal for music in 2006 and received a knighthood for his services to music in 2017.In 2019, he married Welsh harpist Hannah Stone who is the former official harpist of King Charles, when he was the Prince of Wales.\u00a0But the case of mistaken identity appeared not to be the only humorous moment during the King's coronation service at Westminster Abbey.\u00a0",
        "US singer Katy Perry\u00a0also left royal spectators in stitches after being spotted wandering round Westminster Abbey like a lost lamb.\u00a0The 'California Gurls' singer, who will perform at the Coronation Concert at Windsor Castle tomorrow, was caught by fans searching far and wide for her seat.\u00a0Unable to see thanks to an impressive fascinator, she can be seen cocking her head and spinning around in circles in desperate search for her place."
