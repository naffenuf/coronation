        "Crocheters across the country have been stocking up on wool and letting their imaginations \u201cgo wild\u201d to celebrate the coronation, creating royal-inspired postbox toppers including portrayals of the King, Queen Consort and crown jewels.",
        "Marge Ellis is the coordinator for new members at The Secret Society of Hertford Crafters and facilitated the creation of their pillar box toppers for the coronation \u2013 which is so extensive it even includes a knitted depiction of the group topping a postbox.",
        "The 37 crafted creations \u2013 which were made across a 14-week period by the group \u2013 have found pride and place on pillar boxes in both Hertford and Ware, centred on five themes: coronation, celebration, the King, community and conservation.\u201cPeople\u2019s imaginations have gone wild,\u201d Mrs Ellis told the PA news agency.\u201cWe have a topper of the Tower of London and beefeaters.",
        "\u201cWe thought it might be nice to actually look at King Charles himself and who he is and what he does and what makes him happy.\u201cSo we\u2019ve got his Jack Russell dogs and we\u2019ve got the King fishing.\u201d",
        "The group, which has an age range of 19 to 99, has even created a self-referential postbox topper depicting the group placing a topper on a pillar box.\u201cI love it, I have to say,\u201d Mrs Ellis said.\u201cAnd I am even on it.\u201dMrs Ellis added that for the conservation theme, someone found out that Charles was keen on the Black Cornish Bee project.",
        "The money raised from the postbox toppers, which are eventually to be auctioned off, will go towards the Essex &amp; Herts Air Ambulance Trust.",
        "Mrs Ellis added: \u201cIt\u2019s not just a case of putting a topper on a postbox, it\u2019s a way of making people happy and it\u2019s a way of life.\u201cOne woman said she was excited about the coronation because of our toppers, it\u2019s fantastic, and some have even had tears in their eyes, which sets me off.\u201d",
        "Judit Kocsis-Barna, 48, has used her skills as the founder of Inspire Crochet Group in Wallasey to create her own take on coronation regalia, dubbed \u201cthe cartoon version of the crown jewels\u201d by her husband \u2013 Istvan, 48.",
        "Ms Kocsis-Barna, who works as a carer, made a crocheted crown, sceptre and orb, complete with crocheted gemstones, as part of a postbox topper which also includes work from others in her group.\u201cWe usually put our creations on a postbox outside Wallasey Post Office \u2013 which is a huge oval one \u2013 which Amanda and Sarah who work there have looked after for us this year,\u201d she told PA.",
        "\u201cMembers Sandy, Pat, Karen, Norma have helped with other items including guards and Camilla holding her crown in the wind and Charles wrapping his arm around her, and I made a crown, sceptre and orb.",
        "\u201cI roped in my husband who built the structure for the crown for me and he mapped out where I should crochet the coloured gemstones.\u201cHe has called the crown the cartoon version of the crown jewels.\u201d",
        "Ms Kocsis-Barna has crocheted since the age of nine, and has spent \u201chours, hours and hours\u201d making the three items, in which she closely studied images of the regalia online and in Anna Keay\u2019s book, The Crown Jewels: The Official Illustrated History.She added that the orb was the easiest to make and includes a plastic bowling ball, with the sceptre proving to be tricky because of its partially twisted shape.",
        "\u201cI thought, I don\u2019t know what to do and it was midnight and I was looking on YouTube for a twisted crochet video and found one in Italian,\u201d she said.\u201cI don\u2019t speak a word of the language and they were crocheting frosting on a cupcake in this twisted style, but I figured out how to do it from that.\u201d",
        "On the afternoon of May 5, the topper is to be kept in St Hilary\u2019s Parish Church.Laura Sharp, 56, who is based in Swindon, has graced three postboxes in her local area with crocheted toppers, with two featuring a crown and the other, mini woolly versions of Charles and Camilla, based on patterns from fellow crocheters on Etsy.",
        "\u201cI thought, I will do a couple of crowns because they look nice and then made gnome versions of Charles and Camila, but adapted the second pattern to make my design bigger and to incorporate more colours,\u201d Laura, who is retired and used to work in the water industry, told PA.\u201cThey just sort of evolve, you get an idea and just go for it.\u201d",
        "Mrs Sharp previously made toppers for the jubilee, which she said came in handy this time around.\u201cRather than chucking them away, I washed them, dismantled what was on it and then it\u2019s ready to use another time.She said that it takes her roughly five hours to crochet a base, with a crown taking around 20 hours to complete.\u201cThe one with the King and Queen on top took longer because they\u2019re a bit more fiddly to make.\u201cI can spend anywhere between 20 to 50 hours on a topper.\u201d",
        "Mrs Sharp \u2013 who has crocheted for roughly three years \u2013 has said she is \u201cabsolutely addicted\u201d to it \u2013 and has been spurred on to keep at it by \u201clovely\u201d responses from the public.\u201cSometimes you go down to the shops and see people standing around it taking photographs, and that\u2019s really nice, and the community really look after them too.\u201d",
        "She joked: \u201cI don\u2019t like seeing naked postboxes anymore \u2013 I just don\u2019t have the time to do them all though.\u201d",
        "Despite not having any strong opinions about the monarchy, Mrs Sharp said she will celebrate the coronation with her friend who is hosting a garden party.\u201cYou probably won\u2019t find me with loads of Charles mugs, but it\u2019s something worth celebrating and I just want to inject some positivity with my work,\u201d she said."
