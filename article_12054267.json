        "CORONATION LIVEBLOG: Click here to follow live updates throughout today\u00a0The newly crowned King and Queen have enjoyed an 'informal' late lunch with their family\u00a0and will have official portraits taken after they\u00a0appeared on the Buckingham Palace balcony today with a select group of senior royals in front of The Mall which was swamped by tens of thousands of cheering supporters.",
        "The royal couple, who are not expected to appear in public again today, had waved to gargantuan crowds before an\u00a0RAF\u00a0flypast, which had to be scaled back to just helicopters and the Red Arrows because of the heavy rain in London.\u00a0The public started chanting 'God Save The King' and gave three cheers as the royals emerged before a resounding cheer when the King and Queen waved to members of the public gathered in the showers. They also sang the national anthem with gusto and several declared the patriotic scenes made them 'proud to be British'.The Mall was a sea of people, many of whom sprinted to get close to the Palace and catch a glimpse of the King and Queen following their historic Coronation watched by 100million people on TV worldwide.Charles and Camilla were joined by the Prince and Princess of Wales, their children, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh and Princess Anne. Once again Prince Louis and Princess Charlotte stole the show with some enthusiastic waving and pointing as the jets flew over the Palace to roars. At one point little Louis was open-mouthed and yelled in shock as the planes rushed over their heads.But their uncle\u00a0Prince Harry\u00a0decided against going back to Buckingham Palace and appears to have been\u00a0driven straight to Heathrow Airport\u00a0to jet home after a 24-hour stay in the UK. He is said to be determined to get back to California to see his son Archie's fourth birthday today.",
        "Charles and Camilla's next scheduled appearance is tomorrow evening's Coronation Concert\u00a0at Windsor Castle, with headline acts including Lionel Richie and Katy Perry. Other members of the Royal Family will join 'Big Lunches' across the country on Sunday.",
        "As the aircraft approached, the Princess of Wales was seen speaking to Prince Louis and encouraging him to look up from the Buckingham Palace balcony.The Prince of Wales made a remark as he leaned closer to his wife, prompting her to turn and smile.Crowds took pictures, screamed and laughed as they watched the Red Arrows pass over Buckingham Palace.Royal fans moved on to The Mall to take selfies and film the helicopters and planes as they passed over.Others popped champagne corks and shouted 'God Save the King'.Alan Dodd, Graham Dodd and Victoria Dodd travelled to London from Southampton to experience the flyover.Victoria Dodd said: 'It was so unexpected. We thought it had been cancelled.'Graham Dodd added: 'It makes you proud to be British.'",
        "King Charles III and Queen Camilla were cheered uproariously by up to 2million people on the streets of a rainy London today\u00a0after the historic first coronation in Britain since 1953.The royal couple have arrived back at Buckingham Palace where they will wave to crowds from the balcony with working royals before a\u00a0planned 60-aircraft RAF flypast, which has been scaled back to just just helicopters and the Red Arrows because of terrible weather.",
        "The King and his wife were crowned in a Christian ceremony that dates back 1,000 years on a day dripping with glorious displays of pageantry. The\u00a0historic two-hour service was marked by several poignant moments including Prince William kissing his father with his estranged brother Harry yards away.The 2,300-strong congregation bowed as the monarch, the 62nd in history, and his wife processed out of the Abbey.\u00a0Charles and Camilla both smiled as they left and\u00a0then entered the Gold State Coach, drawn by horses to take them past 2million in the streets and 7,000 servicemen and women marching through the capital with them.Princess Anne followed their carriage on horseback with senior royals following in other state carriages. A smiling Prince Harry left in a luxury car, as did a much more sombre Prince Andrew. Amid rumours Harry planned to be in and out of Britain in 24 hours, his car was seen leaving London, not going to Buckingham Palace.Queen Elizabeth II's eldest son was crowned King having\u00a0prayed to be a 'blessing' to people of 'every faith and conviction', and serve his millions of subjects in Britain and around the globe.Charles became the 40th reigning sovereign to be crowned at Westminster Abbey, in a ceremony dating back to William the Conqueror in 1066, when Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby placed St Edward's Crown on his head.\u00a0",
        "The King then looked emotional as\u00a0Prince William paid homage to him, in a break with tradition, kneeling to give an oath\u00a0of allegiance to his father. He said: 'I, William, Prince of Wales, pledge my loyalty to you and faith and truth I will bear unto you, as your liege man of life and limb. So help me God.'\u00a0He then stood, touched the crown and kissed the King on the cheek. Charles was moved as he nodded to his son, and said 'amen' and 'thank you William'.The historic crowning, watched around the globe, was a fulfilment of the King's destiny, but followed the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, last September after a 70-year reign.\u00a0Minutes later Camilla was crowned.\u00a0As Andrew Lloyd-Webber's coronation anthem was sung, the Queen was officially enthroned. The enthroning of the Queen was a moment in which Charles and Camilla were 'united in their joint vocation before God'.The monarch and his wife Queen Camilla had smiled at each other and to the congregation as they walked through the church.Mr Welby placed Queen Mary's Crown on the Queen's head and said: 'May thy servant Camilla, who wears this crown, be filled by thine abundant grace and with all princely virtues; reign in her heart, O King of love, that, being certain of thy protection, she may be crowned with thy gracious favour, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.'",
        "The crown was made for Charles's great-grandmother, Queen Mary, for George V's coronation in 1911.The Bishop of Dover then presented the Queen with the Rod with Dove, and the Sceptre with Cross by Lord Chartres.Queen Camilla acknowledged the rod and sceptre by touching them in turn, rather than holding them as Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother did in 1937.The Archbishop of Canterbury then said: 'Receive the Royal Sceptre and the Rod of equity and mercy.'May the Spirit guide you in wisdom and grace, that by your service and ministry justice and mercy may be seen in all the earth.'The service then moved on to the Holy Communion, in which gifts of bread and wine were brought before the King for him to acknowledge.The Archbishop of Canterbury delivered a prayer over the bread and wine and then the Eucharistic Prayer.The Lord's Prayer was then said before Holy Communion was received by the King and Queen.",
        "The monarch had been heir to the throne since the age of three, and was ready to finally embrace his day of destiny with the woman he loves by his side.\u00a0Before his crowning moment the King was anointed with holy oil away from public view. He was\u00a0dressed in a white linen garment called Colobium Sindonis, a golden coat called the Supertunica and has had the coronation girdle placed around his waist.",
        "After being sanctified at his anointing, the King was presented with the Coronation regalia. Minutes earlier Charles swore on the Bible and kissed it, having taken the oath: 'I, Charles, do solemnly and sincerely in the presence of God profess, testify, and declare that I am a faithful Protestant, and that I will, according to the true intent of the enactments which secure the Protestant succession to the throne, uphold and maintain the said enactments to the best of my powers according to law.'His family were sat closest to him in a 2,300-strong congregation, although Prince Harry was sat in the third row, away from Prince William, his wife and children, and other working royals.The Duke of Sussex was seen in the television footage watching intently as the Archbishop raised St Edward's Crown above his father's head before crowning him.And when a few minutes later the congregation paid homage to the new monarch, Harry was seen, along with the other royals around him, speaking the words: 'God save King Charles. Long live King Charles. May the King live forever.'",
        "The two-hour service, pared back from his mother's in 1953, is a pivotal moment in the history of the Royal Family will balance ancient tradition and a future in the 21st century.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In it Charles became the first monarch to pray publicly at a coronation - praying for grace to be 'a blessing to all... of every faith and belief', and to serve after the pattern of Christ.A special personal prayer was written for the King to reflect the 'loving service' theme of the service, and the words were inspired in part by the popular hymn I Vow To Thee My Country.He said: 'God of compassion and mercy whose son was sent not to be served but to serve, give grace that I may find in thy service perfect freedom and in that freedom knowledge of thy truth. Grant that I may be a blessing to all thy children, of every faith and belief, that together we may discover the ways of gentleness and be led into the paths of peace; through Jesus Christ our lord. Amen.'Prime Minister Rishi Sunak read The Epistle - Colossians 1: 9-17 to the congregation.Lambeth Palace said that although Mr Sunak is a Hindu, he is reading as Prime Minister so there is no issue over his personal faith during the Anglican service.",
        "Prince George and the other pages of honour were sitting behind the King in Westminster Abbey as Charles swore the coronation Oath.George's gaze could be seen flitting about the church from his seat behind his grandfather.The prince and his fellow pages then stood behind the kneeling Charles, holding the corners of his trailing robe, as he prayed.The King then signed copies of the Oaths, presented by the Lord Chamberlain, while the choir sang.At the beginning of the coronation service, a Welsh language piece was sung with the choir, together with Sir Bryn Terfel, singing Kyrie Eleison.As the bells of Westminster Abbey rang out, the King and Queen left the carriage. Camilla got out first followed by Charles after a short pause outside the church.The King waved and spoke to his grandson Prince George, a future king, who was among the pages of honour. His parents the Prince and Princess of Wales entered the abbey last before the royal couple arrived.As he arrived for the two-hour service, the Abbey's bells peeled as crowds stood in the rain cheering the arrival of the King and his wife. The entered the Abbey to state trumpeters, with the congregation standing as the royal couple entered.",
        "Prince George was carrying a corner of his grandfather's trailing robes as the royal party made its way into Westminster Abbey.His siblings Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis were earlier seen peering out of a car window as they arrived outside the church.As his father was cheered through the capital, royals including Prince Harry arrived at the service. The Duke of Sussex walked up the aisle alone, smiling at people as he walked to the front of the church. He grinned at people in the congregation\u00a0before he took his seat.Stars in the Abbey included Katy Perry, Lionel Richie, Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber, Stephen Fry, Nick Cave and magician Dynamo, while Dame Emma Thompson gave a thumbs up in excitement. First lady Jill Biden was among the last to enter before the service, sitting with First Lady of Ukraine Olena Zelenska. President Joe Biden has stayed at home.\u00a0The Diamond Jubilee State Coach, drawn by six Windsor grey horses, arrived at Buckingham Palace for the King and Queen at 10am. Members of the Mounted Division of the Household Cavalry have lined up at the entrance to The Mall ahead of the King's Procession to Westminster Abbey.A mile away from the Palace, Westminster Abbey was rammed with the great and good from Britain and around the world as\u00a0Charles III's day of destiny finally arrived and he will be crowned King today.More than 100million people around the world are about to watch the historic first coronation of a British monarch in 70 years - with an estimated 2million people on the streets of London to watch history unfold.\u00a0",
        "Charles and Camilla waved to thousands of spectators lining the street as leading figures began to join members of the congregation in Westminster Abbey.The Prince and Princess of Wales chatted to each other as they waited to walk into the abbey, behind their eldest son Prince George who was one of the King's pages of honour.The couple appeared composed as they walked behind William's father, followed by their daughter Princess Charlotte and their younger son, Prince Louis.Well-wishers near Buckingham Palace were not put off by the rain as the Diamond Jubilee State Coach passed down the Mall.A group of royal fans dressed in Union Jacks sang 'Singing in the Rain' while the service at Westminster Abbey appeared on large screens.Songs from the service were played out over the crowds.People put picnic blankets on the wet floor and sat on steps as they watched cannons being carried along the Mall.The list of 2,300 invited guests reads like a who's who of politics, showbusiness, world leaders and foreign royalty, with a sprinkling of everyday heroes and close family and friends of the King and his wife.French President Emmanuel Macron was attending to show his 'friendship, respect and esteem' for the UK, with US singer-songwriter Lionel Richie, The Repair Shop's Jay Blades, and the Prince and Princess of Wales and their children.The monarch smiled to huge crowds who cheered wildly and waved flags as he was swept into his central London home at 9am.\u00a0On the short journey from St James' Palace, the King, 74, looked solemn and thoughtful at times, in what is undoubtedly the biggest day of his life.\u00a0Senior members of the\u00a0Royal Family\u00a0arrived around 20 minutes later, including Prince Andrew, who was booed by some in the grandstand.",
        "VIP guests queued for a mile from 6am to get one of the prime 2,300 seats inside. The Abbey was full at just before 9am.\u00a0It will also shine a spotlight on Britain's place on the world stage in the UK's biggest ceremonial military operation since the state funeral of Sir Winston Churchill in 1965 with\u00a07,000 servicemen and women marching with the King and Queen.The ceremonial route has been lined by 45 half companies from the Royal Navy, Royal Marines, British Army and Royal Airforce.Ahead of the King setting off from Buckingham Palace, the Foot Guards of the Household Division lined the Mall, the Royal Navy lined the Admiralty Arch, the Royal Marines lined Trafalgar Square and the Royal Air Force were stationed on Whitehall and Parliament Square.",
        "The street liners were placed at five-pace intervals along the procession route - with each half company comprising of one officer and 20 other ranks.His family, including\u00a0Prince Andrew and Princess Anne, enjoyed a dinner at Mayfair club Oswald's last night. Mike and Zara Tindall were out until 2am. Prince Harry\u00a0flew in from Los Angeles yesterday for his 24-hour trip. It emerged last night he has been relegated to the third row in the Abbey with other non-working royals.And on the streets of London today, including on a packed Mall, there is huge excitement among tens of thousands who have been camped out for days so they can see the extraordinary event unfold.\u00a0Approaching two million people - from all corners of the UK, Commonwealth and the world - are flowing into Central London, despite rain being forecast. Trains into the capital were packed this morning, with soldiers taking part in the ceremony seen flowing into mainline stations.\u00a0Guests of the King started arriving at the Abbey from 7am - four hours before the ceremony.\u00a0Some 100 heads of state are in London, with representatives from 203 countries due to attend.Inside Westminster Abbey, the church buzzed with noise as the congregation filed in and took their seats hours before the ceremony was due to start.",
        "A rich royal blue carpet - chosen to highlight the regal red, gold and purple robes of the king and queen - adorned the dais in the coronation theatre.Stunning flowers in reds, burgundies and yellow golds covered the top of the ornate golden High Altar.A smiling Dean of Westminster in his vivid red clerical robe was seen hurriedly carrying the holy oil for the anointing down the length of the abbey from the altar through the quire, clutching the precious ornate silver vessel in both hands.The longest-serving heir to the throne in British history will today be crowned at Westminster Abbey in a ceremony that is steeped in the majesty of his illustrious forebears \u2013 but also embraces and emphasises the proud diversity of modern-day Britain.'There will be all the pomp and ceremony you could dream of, but as little of the \"them and us\" as possible,' one senior royal aide said last night.",
        "Crowned alongside the King, 74, will be his wife of 18 years \u2013 and his love for much, much longer.The once unthinkable has become a reality, and from today the former Camilla Parker Bowles will be known as Queen Camilla as she is anointed and has Queen Mary's Crown placed upon her head.Yesterday the 75-year-old Queen Consort made only a brief public appearance as she attended a final rehearsal at the Abbey with her husband in the morning. She chose not to attend any of the other public engagements by his side, preferring to 'pace herself' and also ensure 'the day was about her husband', sources said.'She loves him unconditionally and always wants him to shine,' a friend said.Last night the couple retired to enjoy a private dinner at their London home, Clarence House.'The calm before the storm \u2013 perhaps metaphorically as well as literally', a friend said with a nod to the dismal weather forecast, something the new King and Queen's celebrations have in common with the late Queen's Coronation in 1953.It came as:\uf06e Prime Minister Rishi Sunak hailed the Coronation as a 'moment of extraordinary national pride';\uf06e The Archbishop of Canterbury, who will anoint and crown the couple today, predicted that people will be 'struck by the majesty and sacred wonder of the service';\uf06e The King, accompanied by his son and daughter-in-law the Prince and Princess of Wales, shocked and delighted well-wishers camping out along The Mall with an impromptu walkabout yesterday;\uf06e A relaxed-looking Charles smiled broadly and threw his hands in the air when he was asked if he was feeling the strain, telling one fan: 'It's people like you that count';\uf06e Kate said she and her children were 'excited but nervous' \u2013 and she even spoke on the phone to a fan's aunt in Tennessee who was unable to fly over after breaking her leg;\uf06e The King and his family entertained dignitaries and world leaders at a series of events, including a glittering reception at Buckingham Palace last night for overseas VIP guests including King Felipe and Queen Letizia of Spain, the Sultan of Brunei, Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark, and the King and Queen of Jordan;\uf06e Prince Harry was expected to arrive in the UK ahead of his 'blink and you'll miss it' appearance at the Coronation ceremony, but there are no plans for him to feature in any of the private family celebrations or official portraits;\uf06e Forecasters warned the weather for today looks unsettled, with heavy rain predicted at times, which could threaten the planned 60-aircraft flypast over Buckingham Palace.Today's Coronation will see 7,000 servicemen and women accompanying Their Majesties, making it the country's biggest ceremonial event since 1953.By 7.30am, there were thousands of people lining Whitehall with flags and wearing Union Jack hats.One enthusiastic member of the crowd is Helen Mutlu, 54, a food business owner from Clevedon, who is in London with her grandson Theo.She said: 'This country can't run without royalty behind it. I've been to everything I can, I've supported the Queen at Trooping the Colour every year.'I was so upset and cried and mourned for the Queen for months and I've only just got over that.'She added: 'My husband complains about my memorabilia all the time. I have a life-size stand-up of the Queen in my lounge - my husband doesn't like that, he says it's too big!'Of the Republic protestors, Mrs Mutlu said: 'Absolute lunatics. Just look at other countries with presidents, they haven't got any organisation.'Indeed, the Coronation procession back from the Abbey after the ceremony is so large that when the King and Queen arrive at Buckingham Palace, the rear will only have reached Downing Street, a mile away.The 2,300-strong congregation will include representatives of 39 Commonwealth nations and 100 heads of state, as well as many hundreds of ordinary citizens who have selflessly served their country and communities \u2013 in a stark divergence from Queen Elizabeth's Establishment-heavy Coronation of 1953. Peers have been replaced in key roles with people of a range of faiths and creeds to emphasise the country's diversity and religious tolerance, as well as women bishops and charity and military representatives.",
        "Inside the historic place of worship, the King will, for the first time, recite a specially written public prayer and pledge his allegiance to his people as he is invested with the glittering regalia of the Crown Jewels, which normally reside in the Tower of London.The moment of his anointing will take place behind a three-sided screen to preserve the moment of solemnity between him and God.Prince William, who was yesterday seen at rehearsals wearing his Order of the Garter robe, will kneel and pledge allegiance to his father, before Charles has the St Edward's Crown placed on his head by the Archbishop of Canterbury and the spine-tingling cry of 'God Save The King' rings out.The King and Camilla \u2013 who will arrive without their crowns as a sign of humility \u2013 will depart in the 261-year-old Gold State Coach, wearing the Imperial State Crown and Queen Mary's Crown.The Princess Royal will ride on horseback behind Charles and Camilla in her role as Gold Stick in Waiting and Colonel of the Blues and Royals.In the first carriage behind the Gold State Coach will be the Prince and Princess of Wales with George, nine, Charlotte, eight, and Louis, five. The next carriage will contain the King's youngest brother, the Duke of Edinburgh, with his wife the Duchess of Edinburgh and their two children.The late Queen's cousin the Duke of Gloucester and his wife the Duchess of Gloucester, and Anne's husband Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence will travel in the third carriage. Following by car will be the Duke of Kent and Princess Alexandra, also cousins of Elizabeth II. There is no place in the procession for the Duke of Sussex and the Duke of York \u2013 who play no formal part in the Coronation ceremony \u2013 nor for Andrew's daughters, Beatrice and Eugenie.Shortly before 2.30pm, the King and his family will make their first appearance on the balcony of Buckingham Palace to greet thousands of well-wishers before a six-minute fly-past involving 60 aircraft including the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight and the Red Arrows, weather permitting.While monarchs have historically held lavish state banquets, the family will then retire for a 'running buffet lunch' and nothing more exotic than a 'nice cup of tea' while they have their official portraits taken in the Throne Room and Green Drawing Room.It has been suggested that the family may make another appearance later. Tomorrow, members of the Royal Family will join 'Big Lunches' across the country as communities come together to celebrate the occasion, before the Coronation Concert at Windsor Castle in the evening, with headline acts including Lionel Richie and a spectacular lighting up of the nation using light displays, lasers and drones.The Coronation bank holiday weekend will conclude on Monday with The Big Help Out, when members of the Royal Family will join volunteers working with local community organisations as part of an initiative to create a lasting legacy from the celebrations. Charles and Camilla, however, will leave for their Sandringham estate in Norfolk for a well-earned break.The Duke of Norfolk, who is organising the ceremony, said: 'The Coronation is an opportunity to bring our great nation, the realms and the Commonwealth closer together, plugging into the power of the past and promoting our shared values to the wider world with all that we have to offer.'Mr Sunak said the weekend would be a chance to reflect on the 'enduring nature of monarchy' and urged the nation to celebrate its history and culture.The Prime Minister added: 'Let's celebrate this weekend with pride in who we are and what we stand for. Let's look to the future with hope and optimism. And let's make new memories, so we can tell our grandchildren of the day we came together to sing God Save The King.'Will you be watching for a glint from the world's biggest diamond? Will Louis steal the show, or the pages? Discover what happens and when on a day that will go down in history in ROBERT HARDMAN's step-by-step guide to King Charles III's CoronationSome will be looking out for the tiniest glimpse of the anointing (good luck with that) or the glint of the Great Star of Africa, the world's largest diamond, in the head of the Sceptre.Historians and theologians won't know where to start. Royal-watchers will be waiting to see who steals the show. Prince Harry? Prince Louis? The page boys?And then there is the music...Everyone, surely, will be waiting for that extraordinary moment when St Edward's Crown is lowered and the cry echoes around the Abbey: 'God save the King!'However you may be intending to watch, it will be a day we remember for a long time. But what to look out for and when?",
        "5am-6amAnyone wanting to watch the procession with their own eyes will find that the best positions in Central London were taken by hardy campers who have been lining The Mall for days. The authorities are asking people not to arrive on the day before 6am, when viewing areas will open along the route. Steel gates control access to the processional area.",
        "The award for the most ostentatious gown surely goes to Queen Caroline, wife of George II, whose dress for the 1727 Coronation was so encrusted with jewels a pulley had to be designed to hold up the skirt so she could kneel down to be crowned.\u00a0",
        "When the police decide the area is full, the gates will shut and people will be redirected to six public viewing areas, in Green Park, St James's Park and Hyde Park. There are 57 all over Britain.6am-7amThe first guests will already be making their way to Westminster Abbey, ready for the 7.15am opening of extensive ticket and security checks. If you are coming by Tube (St James's Park is shut all day), listen out for an unusual 'Mind the Gap' message \u2014 recorded by the King.7am-8amThe 2,200 ticketed guests will already be filling the Abbey. At 7.30am, BBC1 viewers will join Kirsty Young for the start of seven-and-a-half hours of non-stop coverage on both BBC1 and BBC2 (the latter with sign language).8am-9amThe last non-VIP guests will be taking their seats, even though there are still hours to go before the service begins. All regular guests have been told to be seated by 9am.\u00a0Viewers will recognise some of the personal guests such as Ant and Dec or Lionel Richie, as well as the county representatives, the Lord-Lieutenants and a small cluster of MPs and peers drawn by lottery (with 50 seats for each chamber \u2014 and no plus ones).\u00a0At 8.30am, ITV viewers will join Tom Bradby and Julie Etchingham. Those along the route will effectively be locked in position as the processional route is declared 'sterile' from 9am onwards.9am-10amStreet-lining troops are now taking up their positions and will all be in place by 9.40am. From 9.30am, TV viewers will start to see heads of state, prime ministers (and British former prime ministers) and junior foreign royalty take their seats.\u00a0Huw Edwards will be the BBC's commentator inside the Abbey. 'Very limited toilet facilities' inside will shut at 10am and will not reopen until 1.30pm.10am-11amBy now, everyone will be glued to the royal arrivals, especially that of the Dukes of Sussex and York. Last into the Abbey before Their Majesties will be the Prince and Princess of Wales with their two younger children. As a page to the King, Prince George will be lining up separately.At precisely 10.20am, the King and Queen will set off for the Abbey in the Diamond Jubilee State Coach. The newest addition to the Royal Mews, it is a masterpiece of engineering by Australian coachmaker Jim Frecklington.",
        "The monarch with the most illegitimate children at his Coronation was William IV, who invited four of his ten children by the actress Mrs Jordan.William, who was 64, declared he wanted his 1831 Coronation to be a cut-price event.\u00a0It was called a 'half-crown ceremony' by his enemies, although it cost \u00a32 million in today's money.\u00a0",
        "It is a travelling museum of our history, with everything from fragments of the Stone of Destiny to slivers of the climber's ladder which helped the conquerors of Everest to the summit in 1953.The crown on top is from HMS Victory and conceals a hidden 'coachcam' for a CCTV camera.\u00a0The journey to the Abbey, called the King's Procession, will progress at a walk, with a much smaller following than the great cavalcade which follows later in the day. This is a reflection of the monarch arriving in humility, with the grandeur and splendour yet to come.Clare Balding will take over the BBC commentary. At 10.53am precisely the coach arrives at the Abbey and the King and Queen Consort emerge to line up for the royal procession, assisted by their pages who will help carry their robes of state.11am-12 noonThe service opens with the traditional sound of the scholars of Westminster School, high in the triforium, shouting/singing 'Vivat Rex' and 'Vivat Regina'. For the first time, they include female voices since the school now has a co-educational sixth-form.We hear the soaring I Was Glad by Sir Hubert Parry (one of the King's favourite composers) as the vast procession streams through the Abbey. Britain old and new is here in force. Following the junior heralds (pursuivants) in their tabards, come the orders of chivalry and gallantry.Next come the quarterings of the Royal Arms (look out for the young Duke of Westminster in this bit) and the Royal Standard, carried by Francis Dymoke, the Hereditary King's Champion, whose family have been part of every coronation since William the Conqueror.Next up come the clergy, the heralds and the procession of the regalia. The latter has virtually emptied the Jewel House of the Tower of London.Its keeper, Brigadier Andrew Jackson, carries the ring, perhaps the smallest element in a priceless parade of crowns, sceptres, swords, armills and spurs.\u00a0The Great Officers of State are all here \u2014 and, for the first time, a woman will be among them: Penny Mordaunt, Lord President of the Council and bearer of the Sword of State. Here too are women bishops, officiating at a Coronation for the first time.",
        "The King reaches his Chair of Estate, the first of three thrones he will use during the service. And the first voice we hear will be that of a child.\u00a0Chorister Sam Strachan of the Choir of the Chapel Royal will welcome the King on behalf of everyone, to which the King replies: 'I come not to be served but to serve.' It is one of a few new elements introduced to a service rooted in rituals laid down in the 10th and 14th centuries, plus elements of the Old Testament.The service then follows the time-honoured rituals of the Recognition and the Oath. Listen out for an additional oath promising an 'environment in which people of all faiths and beliefs may live freely' \u2014 articulating the King's long-held view that a monarch should be a defender of 'faiths'.A lesson read by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is followed by something we have not seen at a Coronation for many reigns: a sermon by the Archbishop of Canterbury.12 noon-1pmDepending on the length of Justin Welby's address, we will be hitting the great anointing moment at around noon. By now, the King has moved to his second - and principal - Throne, St Edward's Chair, facing the altar. Here is the one part of the entire proceedings off-limits to everyone, even members of the Royal Family.",
        "Elizabeth II went to her Coronation in the Golden State Coach, but in 1761 the 22-year-old George III and 17-year-old Queen Charlotte were carried to the Abbey in sedan chairs.\u00a0At that ceremony, the Archbishop of Canterbury's sermon was almost inaudible because the congregation were opening bottles of wine and eating.\u00a0",
        "Soldiers from each regiment of the Household Division step forward carrying a special screen - embroidered with the names of every country of the Commonwealth - to shield the moment when the Archbishop dabs holy oil on the King's head, chest and arms. This is a moment between the King and the Almighty.Next, comes the investiture as members of different communities and Christian denominations present the King with the regalia, piece by piece.Finally, the moment has come. Addressing the ultimate monarch, 'King of Kings, Lord of Lords', the Archbishop lifts up St Edward's Crown and crowns Charles III.\u00a0The Abbey erupts with God Save The King. From Horse Guards to the Tower of London, to saluting stations around the nation, in Gibraltar and on ships at sea, 21-gun salutes will be fired simultaneously. The bells of the Abbey ring.The King is then enthroned, moving to his third seat of the day, the Throne Chair. Here, he receives a much-shortened homage \u2014 just the Archbishop and the Prince of Wales.\u00a0At which point, we are all invited to join in. This is the bit that has aroused hours of needless squawking. If you don't want to pledge allegiance in front of family and friends, make a cup of tea.Next comes the anointing of Queen Camilla - a scaled-back version but one which will be on camera - and her crowning. Listen out for Andrew Lloyd Webber's magnificent new anthem, Make A Joyful Noise. The couple then retire backstage to the Chapel of St Edward to remove their crowns for Holy Communion.",
        "Finally, they retire again and emerge in their Robes of Estate.

        "At the moment the King and Queen start moving, the front of the parade will already be at the top of The Mall.\u00a0With every unit of the three Services, every Commonwealth realm and almost every Commonwealth nation represented, this procession will be a collector's item.Made up of eight groups, it features no less than 19 bands. The coach is expected at Buckingham Palace at 1.45pm, at which point the King and Queen proceed through to the West Terrace overlooking the lawn.The entire parade, on reaching the Palace, will have formed up here for a royal salute.2pm-3pmThe King and Queen must make haste for the opposite side of the Palace and the mandatory East Front balcony appearance \u2014 still, we hope, in robes and crowns.\u00a0That wing of the Palace is still a building site so they will need to tread warily. Shortly before 2.30pm, expect to see the curtain flicker and the door open. Out will come the royal party. The royal anoraks will be scrutinising the line-up to see who makes an appearance.Finally \u2014 weather depending \u2014 it is the turn of the airborne arms of all three services, especially the RAF, led by three Juno helicopters and four more waves of rotary aircraft. Expect great excitement from the Wales children as Daddy's old colleagues come by.Next come the fixed-wing brigade led by the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight \u2014 the mighty Lancaster and a pair of Spitfires and Hurricanes.\u00a0The fastest come last followed, of course, by the Red Arrows and their red, white and blue smoke.

This is then followed by a new tradition: the opportunity for the public to swear their 'true allegiance' to the Monarch and his heirs. A chorus of millions will participate \u2014 from members of the congregation and subjects in the streets outside to people up and down the country \u2014 in this solemn and joyful moment.Coronation of the QueenIn a shorter sequence to that of the King, Queen Camilla has her own Coronation, which begins with a brief anointing.The last sovereign consort to be crowned was the late Queen Mother in 1937. It is an honour that is bestowed only on female consorts, and therefore His Late Royal Highness Prince Philip had no such ceremony.The CrowningQueen Mary's Crown is placed upon her head.

It is both song and prayer, calling on God to protect the Sovereign and ensure their wise rule. The eponymous phrase is far older than the song, appearing several times in the King James Bible.Greeting of faith leaders, representatives and the governor -generalsIn an unprecedented gesture marking the significance of the religious diversity of the Realms, the Sovereign will spend his final moments in the Abbey receiving a greeting from the leaders and representatives from the major non-Christian faith traditions: Jewish, Hindu, Sikh, Muslim and Buddhist.In a historic first, the complete coronation will be recorded and released as an album on the very day of the ceremony."
