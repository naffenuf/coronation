        "She also highlighted the thigh-high split of her gown.\u00a0'The leg slit was very crucial. It was to add, in my head, more length to my body. I think this is exactly how brides are supposed to feel \u2013 luxurious, beautiful, kind of on top of the world,' Simone added.The Galia Lahav creation was a far cry from the outfit she wore to her lowkey courthouse wedding\u00a0in Texas\u00a0earlier last month.\u00a0For that ceremony, Simone wore a $120 dress from online retailer Selfie Leslie and a pair of white heels from Amazon.The couple, who met on exclusive dating app Raya, wed more than a year after the football player proposed on Valentine's Day 2022.It's been a bridal-themed couple of weeks for Simone who has been giving fans an inside look at her wedding celebrations, which included an extravagant bachelorette party in Belize and a bridal shower.",
