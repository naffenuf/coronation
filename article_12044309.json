        "Pep Guardiola agrees with Sam Allardyce\u2019s assertion that he is as good as him as the Manchester City boss launched a defence of experienced English managers.",
        "Embattled Leeds raised eyebrows this week by turning to the 68-year-old Allardyce in a last-ditch attempt to stave off relegation.Allardyce\u2019s unveiling on Wednesday was similarly surprising as he claimed \u201cthere\u2019s nobody ahead of me in football terms \u2013 not Pep, not (Jurgen) Klopp, not (Mikel) Arteta\u201d.The new Leeds boss will get a chance to show that on Saturday afternoon when his relegation-threatened side travel to treble-chasing City.",
        "Allardyce\u2019s comments were put to Guardiola after Wednesday\u2019s 3-0 win against West Ham and elicited a surprisingly positive response.\u201cHe is right,\u201d the City boss said. \u201cI want to be honest. Now look what happened with, for example, Neil Warnock in Huddersfield.\u201cNow there\u2019s a tendency for these incredible managers, they have done this Premier League or this competition in better position.\u201cIt looks like now the young managers are there with the tactics or whatever\u2026 so they are really good, they help us to be what we are.\u201cLook at the managers, Roy Hodgson for Crystal Palace, what they have done.",
        "\u201cThey are really good, they have incredible experience, they know the game perfectly and if he feels that it is because of this.\u201cIt will be tough because he has the charisma, he will put out the pressure to the players and he knows exactly what to do in this kind of situation in a relegation battle.",
        "\u201cIt looks like this type of old managers\u2026 I\u2019m honest, so what they have done for the club (is dismissed as) \u2018they are old, whatever\u2019.\u201cNow the people who are 35, 40, 45, we invent football or we create football.",
        "\u201cNo, football is already created and these guys belong to that league and helped us to do it and that\u2019s why.\u201cSo, Neil Warnock, Huddersfield was in the last (spot) and now already out of the dangerous positions.\u201cI could not experience what Harry Redknapp has done in this country.\u201cThere are many, many English managers that have done really, really well.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be young to be a good manager. As much experience you have, you are good.\u201d"
