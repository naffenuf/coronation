        "Neil Warnock was a proud man after Huddersfield retained their place in the Sky Bet Championship with a 1-0 victory over promoted Sheffield United, but ruled out staying on as manager into next season.",
        "The 74-year-old came out of retirement in mid-February to take on the role, with the Terriers battling to get out of the relegation zone.However, a run of just one defeat in their last nine league matches ensured they achieved safety as Danny Ward\u2019s stunning 25-yard strike got the job done against United with a game to spare, instead sending Reading tumbling into League One.Warnock had previously said keeping the Terriers up would be the \u201cgreatest achievement\u201d of his career, which has spanned over 1600 games and included eight promotions.And he believes it was no less than the players deserved after a nail-biting 90 minutes at the John Smith\u2019s Stadium.\u201cI\u2019ll remember tonight for the rest of my life,\u201d said Warnock. \u201cIt\u2019s a massive achievement and I couldn\u2019t be any prouder.",
        "\u201cWhen (Warnock\u2019s assistant) Ronnie Jepson phoned me, he said \u2018are you sure? This is the worst team I have seen\u2019. Everyone has worked their socks off for me but I can\u2019t do another 10 months of this. The job is done for me.\u201cI have great memories and didn\u2019t want to leave having gone down.\u201cYou can imagine relegation, jobs at stake. We looked nervous, not wanting to have a second touch. At half-time we told them what we\u2019d been doing the last nine games and we deserved it in the end.",
        "\u201cDanny scored one like that for Cardiff at Forest, I said we could do with another one of those. He\u2019s an unsung hero.\u201cIt\u2019s been an amazing ride. I think tonight could have converted youngsters for years to come.\u201cI remember watching Joe Shaw for (Sheffield) United one night and it did me. I had to be an United-ite and there will be Town fans like that tonight.\u201dThe Blades enjoyed a promotion party of their own last month after they secured their return to the Premier League.But they had to endure watching Huddersfield celebrate this time around and boss Paul Heckingbottom admitted it was a difficult result for his team.\u201cOf course we have to put it into perspective but not one of us enjoyed that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve earned the right to be in that position.\u201cI can\u2019t help how I feel after a defeat. It was evident in the second half that there was one team scrapping for survival.\u201cI am not going to be tough on the lads. They have been fantastic and that\u2019s the difference when you haven\u2019t got that edge.\u201cWe were good first half and missed chances, but second half they played it like a Championship match.\u201dWhen asked about Warnock\u2019s achievement of keeping the hosts up, Heckingbottom said: \u201cResults have picked up. I have seen a lot of games and they have turned some really good teams over.",
        "\u201cHe\u2019s worked his magic and got what he, and the club, wanted.\u201d"
