        "As shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves has been on a charm offensive in the City to try to reassure the markets that the economy will be safe in Labour's hands.Oxford-educated Reeves plays up her time as a Bank of England economist to underline her credentials to become the first female Chancellor.But, by her own account, she hasn't a clue about one of Labour's most straightforward stealth taxes \u2014 the \u00a312.50 daily charge being introduced by London Mayor Sadiq Khan. The levy is the extension of his hated Ultra-Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) to all 33 Greater London boroughs in August.The expansion of ULEZ is likely to affect an additional 1.5 million motorists who drive into London, as well as 700,000 already living in the capital, because their cars are considered too old and polluting.Yet asked by LBC's Nick Ferrari if she agreed with the extension of ULEZ, Reeves pleaded ignorance.",
        "'I am a Leeds MP and we don't have that up here and don't have these congestion charges in the city that I represent. I'm not across the ins and outs of the congestion charge in London.' Who is she trying to kid? The ULEZ has the backing of the Shadow Cabinet, of which she's a member, and party leader Sir Keir Starmer is a big fan.Reeves was born and raised in London, has a home in the city and, in 2005, was a Labour candidate in Bromley, South-East London, two years after the congestion charge was introduced. What's more, her sister Ellie Reeves is a London MP and is married to John Cryer, also a London MP.Does she really expect voters to believe that she's not au fait with the ULEZ? On the other hand, if she really isn't, she's not fit to be Shadow Chancellor."
