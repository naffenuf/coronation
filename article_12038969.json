        "BP is ploughing ahead with plans to deliver billions of pounds\u2019 worth of buybacks per year \u2013 in a bumper day for City investors.",
        "The energy giant said it was \u2018committed\u2019 to a stellar programme, with an initiative to deliver buybacks of around \u00a33.2billion per year based on current forecasts.It announced a further share buyback yesterday, announcing it would repurchase \u00a31.4billion worth of shares over the next three months. This follows profits of \u00a34billion for the first three months of the year.",
        "Chief executive Bernard Looney said: \u2018This has been a quarter of strong performance and strategic delivery.\u2019But some investors were disappointed that profits did not match last year\u2019s equivalent of \u00a35billion. Shares slumped 8.6 per cent, or 46.05p, to 488.35p.Profits were boosted by a strong commodity trading performance. Chief financial officer Murray Auchincloss said its gas traders had made \u2018the right call\u2019 on price declines and its oil traders also had a \u2018very good\u2019 quarter.Oil prices have dipped from a peak following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine early last year.The results again saw BP come under fire, with the mammoth profits reigniting calls for energy giants to be forced to pay more tax.Energy groups have faced scrutiny over the past year after raking in monster profits while households have grappled with higher bills.BP has already forked out \u00a3800million under the existing windfall tax but yesterday politicians called for the company to be taxed more.",
        "Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said BP\u2019s profits were those \u2018that they didn\u2019t expect to make, these are profits that are over and above because the world price of energy is so high\u2019.Luke Hildyard, director of the High Pay Centre think tank, said: \u2018Supersized profits made by oil companies and other corporate giants overwhelmingly accrue to the super-rich.\u2018These huge windfalls are pure geopolitical accident.\u2019But speaking to the media yesterday, Auchincloss added: \u2018We know how difficult a time it is. We get it.\u2019But he brushed aside calls for a tougher windfall tax, saying: \u2018Taxes are for government, not us. We are not going to speculate.\u2019",
