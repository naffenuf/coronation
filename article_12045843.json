        "Newly-single Amber Turner put on a casual display as she hit the gym with Chloe Meadows on Wednesday.",
        "It comes only a day after the TOWIE star, 29, confirmed she had split from boyfriend and co-star Dan Edgar\u00a0after six years of dating in an Instagram statement on Tuesday.\u00a0It's been claimed that the reason Amber ended their relationship is because she was tired of waiting for her long-term boyfriend to propose.\u00a0Following the announcement, Amber appeared in light spirits as she laughed and chatted to her close friend.The star rocked a casual ensemble, opting for an oversized grey jumper and grey gym leggings.She teamed the look with a pair of white trainers, black sunglasses and toted a Louis Vuitton bag to carry her belongings.",
        "Keeping fit, she carried boxing pads in her arms and sipped on a shake.The beauty tied her long locks back into a pony tail, cascading past her shoulders.\u00a0Chloe, 31, rocked a similar look, also donning an oversized grey jumper and khaki gym leggings.\u00a0Ready to hit the gym, the beauty added a pair of white trainers to her ensemble and carried her own set of boxing gloves in her arms.It is said that Amber had been desperate to settle down with the hunk and 'lost her patience' after being left disappointed that he didn't pop the question after they purchased their dream home together last year.",
        "'She was convinced a proposal would be coming soon after they moved into their dream home together at the end of last year. But Dan has failed to make the changes he promised to make for Amber and still seems undecided about the future.'They went on: 'Amber was always willing to give Dan time as he shied away from commitment, but she lost patience.'The insider added that the blonde bombshell knows she wants to get married and have children some day, but refused to 'waste anymore time' on a person who just 'wasn't ready'.\u00a0\u00a0A source told The Sun: 'Amber has been desperate to settle down for years now, but Dan has always been hesitant.Earlier this week,\u00a0Amber said she was forced to release a statement after split rumours swirled following Dan, 31, unfollowing her on social media.In December the couple purchased their 'dream' Essex mansion just days before Christmas with an excited Amber gushing about the move with fans.On Monday in less happier circumstances Amber shared on her Instagram Stories: 'I wasn't going to post anything but due to speculation and questions I feel like I need to'.'Yes me and Dan have split'.\u00a0",
        "She continued: 'I honestly wish him the best for the future. Please respect our privacy at this time. Thank you'.",
        "Amber is currently in UAE city celebrating her mum Suzanne's 60th birthday following the shock split.\u00a0\u00a0MailOnline has contacted Amber and Dan's representatives for comment.Despite being an item since 2017, it's certainly not the first time cracks have shown in Dan and Amber's relationship.Last year, Ella Rae Wise\u00a0slammed the former electrician for acting 'inappropriately' in a nightclub and claimed Amber shouldn't trust him.TOWIE star Ella, then 22, told MailOnline Dan 'needs to keep his hands to himself' and she was shocked he behaved in such a way given he's in a long-term relationship.In an exclusive interview, Ella explained that Dan is yet to apologise for the incident, which allegedly took place during a night out last year, and she's been branded a 'liar' by her co-stars, including Amber's close friends Chloe Meadows and Courtney Green.She said: 'Dan needs to keep his hands to himself really. He shouldn't touch up other girls when he has a girlfriend.'He was hands on and given he has a girlfriend, it was inappropriate.'With his track record I don't know how she can allow her man to go out.",
        "'I'm not the biggest fan of theirs and they're not the biggest fans of me but I'm the worst person he could have touched up in a club because I'm not going to keep it a secret.",
        "'I've been called a liar, which is fine because I've been called a liar before on the show and I can see why they would have animosity towards me but if her boyfriend were to touch up someone \u2013 I'm not the best person because I am going to tell the truth.'Those girls automatically thought I was lying about it, but I wasn't. Dan was horrible to me afterwards, but you'll see on the new series.'A source close to the show told MailOnline: 'Dan put his hands around Ella's waist while they were in a club \u2013 nothing more.'MailOnline revealed last June that Amber's relationship with Dan had been rocked following claims he 'always wanted a piece of Ella.'In a voice note that will be aired on the new series, Ella described her account of events to co-star Harry Derbidge and the allegation quickly circulated in Essex.Speaking in defence of Amber and Dan's relationship, Chloe accused Ella of fabricating the incident and claims her only concern is raising her public profile.Chloe said: 'I just think the person that started that rumour is starving, absolutely starving. She's starving for storylines, clout, attention, fame; you name it she is gagging for it. Yes, I'm talking about Ella.'",
        "A statement posted by Ella on Instagram today, read: 'Some of you may have seen some press stories today saying that I said that Dan Edgar touched me inappropriately.'I do want to make it clear that Dan Edgar did not touch me inappropriately without my consent.'What I did mean is that I think how he has acted towards me whilst having a girlfriend is not okay.'No boyfriend should hold someone's hand or put his hands around another girl's waist while in a relationship.'This is a story that is covered in the upcoming series of TOWIE, where you will see both sides to the story from myself and Dan.'Ella explained that tension between herself and Dan caused a rift in the cast and Amber and her close group of friends ostracised her.She said: 'The other group don't let a lot of people in.'If they don't like the look of you, they don't want you in their group. With us, where we don't comply and we won't agree with everything they say, they would rather not get on with us and that sits completely fine with me because they're not my people either.'Ella, who's previously admitted to having a 'flirty relationship' with Pete Wicks, 33, says the pair dated this series \u2013 but their romance has never gone further than a kiss.",
        "She's also not fazed by the couple's 11-year age difference and says even her mum encourages her to date an older man.'I did have a few cheeky, little dates with Pete', Ella explained.'We have never gone any further than a kiss. With us it can't go any further than that because I don't want to ruin our friendship because I appreciate him a lot as a person.'Age is nothing but a number and it's more about their mindset than their age. I'm 22 but I'm going on 35. My mum said to me that I need an older man in my life.'"
