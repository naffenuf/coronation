This unit is so quiet, its hard to believe that you have New York City below you.'",
        "Set across three floors, Enes starts his tour of the sky-high dwelling on the first level, which is accessible via two private elevators.\u00a0Off the lobby there is a washroom, a media room, a formal dining room that can seat 12 people, an observatory-cum-lounge area decked out with telescopes and a smart office facing Central Park.\u00a0Enes says of the observatory: 'This has to be one of my favorite rooms in the penthouse... everything about it just looks right.'However, when it comes to the grandest room in the property, he directs viewers to the 'grand salon.'This cavernous room - measuring 1,500sq ft - certainly makes for an impressive sight, with\u00a027ft high ceilings, 'multiple seating areas,' 'curated furniture,' and 'breathtaking views.'",
        "'This is just unreal,' Enes says as he looks North towards Central Park and upstate New York through the towering floor to ceiling windows.He explains: 'You can see the entire park and the lake from Central Park looks so small from here.'\u00a0To the South, the social media star points out the Statue of Liberty in the distance.\u00a0\u00a0Moving on with his walk around, Enes navigates the kitchen which comes with lacquered cabinetry and an island in the center topped with\u00a0quartzite countertops.",

        "Topping things off, there are two dedicated rooms for walk in closets. These are currently unfurnished so they can be fitted out to meet the owner's tastes.\u00a0The top floor of the record-breaking apartment serves as a space for entertaining, with a 1,000 sq ft ballroom.The space, Enes says, is 'perfect for private dinners, runway shows, fundraisers and the list goes on.'\u00a0",
        "'You could easily have 200 to 300 people here very comfortably,' he adds.Off the ballroom there are two bathrooms and a chef's kitchen.\u00a0Then, serving as the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance, there is a 1,433sq ft terrace space with glass barriers allowing the views to take center stage.\u00a0The One Above All Else is located within the 1,550 ft-high Central Park Tower.

        "To stop the tower from wobbling in high winds, architects installed the world's biggest and heaviest tuned mass damper on the 137th floor. This mechanical structure - weighing around 1,200 tons - helps to absorb vibrations.\u00a0Currently there are 11 units still available within Central Park Tower, with the prices ranging from $6.5 million to $62.5 million.\u00a0Then,\u00a0The One Above All Else penthouse, with\u00a017,545sq ft of interior space, is in a league of its own.Summing up the property, listing agent\u00a0Ryan Serhant said: 'When you live above sound, when you are high enough above the concrete jungle that is New York City, there is something about the passage of time when you are in this home that I have never experienced anywhere else in the world.\u00a0'And it's not just the height, it's the volume the 30ft ceilings, the space that's been crafted to be unlike anything else. which is why we call it\u00a0The One Above All Else.'"
