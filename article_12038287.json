        "Sussex among 13 counties who will with Australians in their ranks this summer\u00a0Aussie stars can gain valuable match practice while England players are at IPL\u00a0Batsman Smith will play three three County Championship matches for SussexSteve Smith, resplendent in his Sussex tracksuit, could not resist smiling when it was suggested the Poms are giving him a helping hand in his quest to win the Ashes.",
        "\u2018I\u2019m not sure about that,\u2019 said the Australian star batsman who has arrived at Hove for three County Championship matches ahead of the World Test final against India next month and then the biggest series of them all. \u2018I\u2019m just excited to play some cricket.\u2018I\u2019ve seen a lot of talk about me getting used to conditions here but you\u2019ve got to remember I\u2019ve played a lot of cricket in England so conditions aren\u2019t really new to me.\u2018I\u2019m looking forward to the next couple of weeks, hanging out with some of the young batters, having some good conversations with them and helping them on their journey.\u2019It remains one of the most contentious topics in English cricket. On the one hand there is the argument of Sussex and the 12 other counties with Australians in their ranks this summer who insist their presence is for the betterment of the domestic game.",
        "Then there are those who believe it can only help the likes of Smith and others, including Marcus Harris at Gloucestershire and Marnus Labuschagne at Glamorgan, to get valuable match practice while many England players are otherwise engaged at the IPL.\u2018I\u2019ve always wanted to play County Championship cricket,\u2019 said Smith, who makes his Division Two debut against Worcestershire on Thursday at Worcester. \u2018I\u2019ve played internationally for 13 or 14 years now and never really had the opportunity.",
        "\u2018Hopefully I can do some really good things in these three matches and players are able to watch me and how I go about the game. I\u2019m also here to talk so if any of the batters want to have a chat with me about cricket I\u2019m all ears.\u2019Trevor Bayliss would point out, when he was coaching England, that you would never see an Australian Sheffield Shield side signing an English player during an Ashes summer.But Smith, sitting next to his new coach Paul Farbrace at Hove, insisted he would have no issues if, say, New South Wales recruited Joe Root ahead of the next Ashes in Australia.\u2018I think that would be great,\u2019 said the former Australia captain, who was clean bowled by his new team-mate and Ashes rival Ollie Robinson in his first Sussex net session.\u2018Someone like Joe is a class performer and the young batters in Australia could learn a lot from him. I\u2019d have no dramas if he or any England player played for New South Wales.\u2019The smiles even kept coming when Smith was asked what he thought about Stuart Broad\u2019s comments in Mail Sport last week that caused something of a stir in Australia. That, to his mind, the last Ashes in a Covid environment in Australia should be declared void.",
        "\u2018That was a little odd,\u2019 said Smith, who will bat at five for Sussex after his captain Cheteshwar Pujara. \u2018We were all there and playing. He\u2019s a nice guy and loves throwing out some good banter so it\u2019s all part of it. We couldn\u2019t really complain that much.\u2019"
