        "The head of an anti-monarchy group arrested ahead of a planned protest on Coronation Day has branded the detention of him and dozens of others a \u201cdirect attack on our democracy\u201d.",
        "Republic chief executive Graham Smith, who was released on Saturday night after nearly 16 hours in police custody, said officers should \u201chang their heads in shame\u201d.",
        "The Metropolitan Police confirmed that 52 people were arrested for affray, public order offences, breach of the peace and conspiracy to cause a public nuisance around the coronation.Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said he had demanded \u201cclarity\u201d from the force\u2019s leaders on the arrests.He tweeted: \u201cSome of the arrests made by police as part of the Coronation event raise questions and whilst investigations are ongoing, I\u2019ve sought urgent clarity from Met leaders on the action taken.\u201dMr Smith said a total of eight members of Republic\u2019s team were arrested as they prepared for \u201ca peaceful and lawful protest\u201d.He told the PA news agency officers had been \u201cintimidating, heavy-handed, not willing to listen, not willing to co-operate or to engage\u201d.He added: \u201cThey clearly made up their mind they were going to arrest us the moment we got there.\u201dThey were arrested for being equipped for locking on, a new offence under the controversial Public Order Act.In a statement, Mr Smith said: \u201cThese arrests are a direct attack on our democracy and the fundamental rights of every person in the country.\u201cEach and every police officer involved on the ground should hang their heads in shame.\u201d",
        "He said the right to protest peacefully in the UK \u201cno longer exists\u201d and that the detentions \u201cdestroyed whatever trust might have existed\u201d between campaign groups and the police.",
        "Asked what further action he and other members of Republic face, Mr Smith told PA: \u201cWe don\u2019t know. We\u2019ve all been bailed, that\u2019s all we know. So, we will hear about whatever happens later.\u201dCulture Secretary Lucy Frazer argued that police got the \u201cbalance right\u201d between allowing protest and enjoyment of the King\u2019s coronation.She defended the Met after the force was heavily criticised by MPs and human rights groups over the arrests, denying that officers had gone too far.The Cabinet minister told Sky News\u2019 Sophy Ridge On Sunday programme: \u201cWhat they have to do is balance the right to protest, which is important in a democracy. At the same time there\u2019s the right of all those other people to enjoy what was a fabulous day.\u201cI think, overall, they managed to get that balance right.\u201dShe said it was right of the police to take into account the context of the event, as it took place on the world stage with hundreds of foreign dignitaries attending and had national security implications.Parts of the Public Order Act which recently came into force mean protesters who have an object with the intention of using it to \u201clock on\u201d are liable to a fine, with those who block roads facing 12 months in prison.",
        "Asked whether she trusts the police to use the new laws, Ms Frazer said: \u201cYes, I do trust them to use those new powers.\u201cI have huge confidence in the police.\u201dThe new laws are intended to \u201credress the balance\u201d after a recent change in demonstrators\u2019 tactics, she said.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen in this country a rise in protests and the way people are protesting that is interfering with the rights of people to go around their daily life.\u201dMetropolitan Police Commander Karen Findlay acknowledged concerns about the arrest of protesters but defended Scotland Yard\u2019s actions, saying: \u201cOur duty is to do so in a proportionate manner in line with relevant legislation.\u201dThe Met said they received information that protesters were \u201cdetermined to disrupt\u201d the coronation \u2013 including defacing public monuments with paint, breaching barriers and disrupting official movements. What worries is me is that the Conservative Government have now increased these sort of wide-ranging powers ... what they haven\u2019t done is enshrined the sort of legal responsibility and the duty on the police to actually facilitate peaceful protest  Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper  The Liberal Democrats\u2019 deputy leader said she has \u201cconcerns\u201d that the police may not have got the balance right in handling protests.\u201cSome of that information is unfolding. But, on the face of it, I do have concerns,\u201d Daisy Cooper told Ridge.",

We do not want a totalitarian police state.\u201d"
