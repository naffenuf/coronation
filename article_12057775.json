It has happened to me,' she saidThe inaugural Latin Women in Music gala will air on Telemundo on Sunday, May 7.The upcoming two-hour special, also known as Mujeres Latinas in la M\u00fasica, celebrates 'Latin female artists, executives, and creatives proactively working for positive change, inclusion, and gender parity in the music industry,' according to Billboard.The accomplished singer has been in the music industry since her teens, with 11 studio albums under her belt and multiple Latin Grammys as well.",

        "Shakira and Gerard split after a 12-year relationship, and the 36-year-old former footballer recently revealed he has listened to Shakira\u2019s so-called 'diss track' that appears to mock him and his new 23-year-old girlfriend Clara Chia.The singer released the tune Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 53 which she has said was a cathartic way of expelling her pain over their split.Gerard said in an interview with Barcelona-based radio station RAC1: 'Yes, obviously (I\u2019ve listened to it),' but\u00a0added he didn\u2019t want to comment further, saying: 'I don\u2019t want to talk about it \u2013 I don\u2019t think I should talk about it.'The ex-footballer stressed that all he wants is for his kids to be happy saying,\u00a0'We have a responsibility, those of us who are parents must protect our children. Everyone makes their own decisions. I don\u2019t feel like talking anymore. I just want my children to be well... I\u2019ve always had a close relationship with my children.'"
