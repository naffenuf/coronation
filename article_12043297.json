But missionary is my favorite. I want to be f*****g manhandled.'The star said - depending on her partner's manhood size - that her least favorite position was doggy style because it could 'hurt' her.\u00a0\u00a0In March, the star, who previously dated comedian Bill Hader, revealed she did not have an orgasm during sexual intercourse until she was 38.",

        "'Apparently there were names brought up in both regards and I am not OK with that, because it had nothing to do with that,' she said.After Viall said that they were 'not shaming any exes,' Bilson added, 'Or giving a trophy to any other exes.'The Take Two star said that 'nobody was involved other than' herself.Last year Rachel confirmed her previous romance with Hader, which ended in 2020, the year she turned 39.\u00a0",

I had nothing else to do but sit in it, and deal with it and feel it. 'It was probably the hardest thing I've ever done\u2060, harder than childbirth. It hurt like a motherf******!'Around the same time, it was alleged by an insider that Rachel had gone through an 'amicable' separation from Bill.However, Rachel admitted on the podcast that she had managed to move past the breakup and is now 'looking for the next thing.'She said: 'If you actually face it, you can come out of it and be like, 'OK, I did that and I'm ready for the next thing.'Back in August 2022, Bilson confirmed she had a new boyfriend,\u00a0 rumored to be artist Zac LaRoc.She also had a high-profile romance with The OC co-star Adam Brody from 2003-2006."
