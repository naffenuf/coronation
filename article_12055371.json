Could really tell he was nervous throughout the audition.'",

Should have had the golden buzzer.'Another viewer remarked: 'Travis smashed it. He was probably better than the golden buzzer acts.'Someone else tweeted: 'You know that #Gogglebox is going to show the #MrBlobby bit from #BGT next week instead of this legend!

        "Travis appeared to be so nervous before his audition that he was rendered speechless when asked what he hoped to get out of appearing on Britain's Got Talent by head judge Simon.\u00a0However, while Travis appeared to have stage fright, some viewers called into question just how genuine this was.\u00a0They took to Twitter to claim they'd previously seen him on television drama Casualty.One person wrote: 'Well done, Travis George said he's never done anything like #bgt before, yet he's been on Casualty! #britainsgottalent Another scouted act?'",
        "Someone else shared: 'This Travis guy in #BritainsGotTalent has connections He was in #casualty two weeks ago playing the boyfriend to the pregnant lady with down syndrome Is #BGT going to admit it's fixed?''Travis was just on casualty again a couple of weeks ago, I knew I recognised him lmaooo,' wrote another viewer.While someone else shared: 'I'm sure Travis George has been on casualty !! He was on last week I'm sure #BGT.'",
