        "Rochdale ended 102 years as a Football League club with a 1-1 draw at Harrogate.",
        "A Jimmy Keohane effort midway through the first half had given the already-relegated visitors hope that they might sign off with a fourth win in eight games.But Toby Sims earned the Sulphurites a share of the spoils with his first goal in the English pro game, following a January move from US second-tier outfit the Pittsburgh Riverhounds.Rochdale had earlier started the game with a confidence that belied their position propping up the entire EFL and took a deserved lead, courtesy of a well-crafted goal.Veteran striker Ian Henderson was the instigator, showing nimble footwork in the middle of the pitch before releasing Tyrese Sinclair through the right channel. Sinclair\u2019s square pass then saw Keohane beat home keeper Mark Oxley from eight yards.At the other end, on-loan Southampton winger Kazeem Olaigbe squandered the hosts\u2019 best first-half chance, wastefully missing the target after being sent clear on goal by Sam Folarin.",
        "After the break, a deflected Henderson effort bounced off the top of the bar while Folarin also grazed an upright before Sims levelled in the 74th minute.The 25-year-old right-back found the net with a six-yard sidefooted volley after being picked out at the far post by Olaigbe\u2019s cross from the left byline."
