        "Hibernian manager Lee Johnson hailed Elie Youan\u2019s work-rate in Saturday\u2019s 2-1 victory over St Mirren, although he admitted the unpredictable forward can leave him tearing his hair out in frustration at times.",
        "The 24-year-old \u2013 on loan from Swiss side St Gallen \u2013 scored his seventh goal of the season after just four minutes and had supporters in raptures with his willingness to track back and make tackles.\u201cWe expect that from our wingers,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to work hard. I\u2019m pretty critical when they don\u2019t, so when they do it\u2019s fantastic.\u201cWe call it (being) a ball thief when they nick it on the way back in. Elie\u2019s earned his rest over the weekend because of the physical effort he put in, and that\u2019s what Elie has got to do.\u201cHe can frustrate the life out of us at times \u2013 I\u2019m sure he even frustrates you guys (reporters), who are impartial \u2013 but he\u2019s also got that real threat about him and can peg a team back and he can run all day.\u201cHe\u2019s still young and he\u2019s got quite unique attributes so we just need to keep developing him.\u201d",
        "Hibs are keen to sign Youan permanently, and Johnson admits if the attacker was able to hit his best form consistently, he would be out of their reach.\u201cIf he put it all together we wouldn\u2019t have him,\u201d he smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to try and do before we sell him!",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s difficult for me to talk about his contract but we do have an option to buy. Every negotiation is different. Some are done in advance and then put in a drawer, and some still need to be done. Obviously that\u2019s not my bag, that\u2019s for the CEO to deal with.\u201dWill Fish scored Hibs\u2019 second before Alex Greive hit back for the Buddies who were unable to force an equaliser despite piling on the pressure in the closing stages.The defeat saw Saints slip three points behind the fifth-placed Hibees in the battle for European places. Stephen Robinson\u2019s men host fourth-placed Hearts next Saturday.Robinson of his team\u2019s Euro prospects: \u201cThey aren\u2019t as good as they were before the game. You can pull that back very quickly, there are 12 points still to play for.\u201cWe\u2019ve got Hearts at home next week and we\u2019ve been very good at home. We need to press more aggressively than we did in the first 20 minutes (against Hibs) and hope and pray we don\u2019t make individual errors.\u201d"
