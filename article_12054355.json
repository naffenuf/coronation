        "The King displayed \u201cself-comforting\u201d gestures while maintaining his poise during the coronation ceremony, according to a body language expert.",
        "Charles was crowned at Westminster Abbey, as Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby placed St Edward\u2019s Crown on his head.With 2,300 guests at the abbey and the world watching, the body language of the senior members of the royal family was under scrutiny.",
        "\u201cCharles interlaces his fingers when he relaxes his hands, showing a mild self-comforting and relaxing gesture,\u201d communications coach and media trainer Sonia Beldom told the PA news agency.She said the King showed dignity from the moment he entered the abbey.\u201cCharles\u2019s face shows immense poise and his slightly open mouth displays a genuine smile for everyone he greets on his way in,\u201d she said.The newly-crowned Queen\u2019s body language was more at ease than her husband\u2019s.",
        "Camilla \u201clooks relaxed and very happy, with her chin slightly tilted down to convey respect and humility\u201d, Ms Beldom added.The couple\u2019s bond was evident in their body language, the expert also said.\u201cHis deep connection to Camilla is clear as he looks towards her at key moments \u2013 this is a sign of bonding even though they are feet apart,\u201d she continued, while Camilla\u2019s \u201clevel chin, gentle smile and alert eyes\u201d are a sign of \u201cpoise and confidence\u201d.When Charles delivered a King\u2019s Prayer, the first time a monarch has spoken words to God aloud during a coronation, Ms Beldom said: \u201cHis voice tone is clear, resonant and dignified in its pace, conveying great authority and gives us a sense of having a strong and dignified man as our King.",
        "\u201cHis voice is comforting in its tone and presence. His voice commands respect and it\u2019s a voice you want to listen to.\u201dHowever some aspects of the King\u2019s body language might have betrayed his inner thoughts, Ms Beldom noted.During the service, she said the King\u2019s blink rate would occasionally increase: \u201cThis can often be a signal of increased emotion.\u201dPlus, when the Prince of Wales kissed his father\u2019s cheek, Ms Beldom suggested the King was \u201cvisibly moved\u201d.",
        "When he \u201clooks down, this signals that he is accessing a deep internal dialogue\u201d, she suggested. \u201cHe is literally \u2018feeling\u2019 what is going on around him in his thinking.\u201dMuch can also be gleaned from other family members\u2019 body language.The Duke of Sussex was \u201clooking a little nervous\u201d, Ms Beldom said.",
        "\u201cHis head gestures are a little jerky.\u201cHe is more relaxed when he\u2019s inside the abbey,\u201d she added, noting that his body language became \u201cmore fluid\u201d after this point.Ms Beldom continued: \u201cThe Prince and Princess of Wales are characteristically very professional as they move together and are perfectly synchronised, showing kindred spirits and of like mind.\u201d"
