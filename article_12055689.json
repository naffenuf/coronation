        "Two goals in a four-minute span of the second half gave host CF Montreal a 2-0 win over Orlando City SC on Saturday night.",
        "Montreal (4-6-0, 12 points) took the lead in the 62nd minute.Rudy Camacho had the ball at his feet near the penalty spot, but his shot found only the post. Aaron Herrera collected the rebound and curled back to the top of the box on his left foot. His shot found defender Robin Jannson, and the ball bounced off him and past goalkeeper Pedro Gallese for an own goal.Montreal made it 2-0 only four minutes later. Herrera and Bryce Duke combined down the right side before Duke put Herrera into the box. Herrera cut it back, and second-half substitute Romell Quioto made no mistake from almost on top of the penalty spot. He calmly slotted it home to make it 2-0.Quioto continued to trouble the visitors after coming on in the 60th minute. He got the insurance goal and he drove against the back line on fresh legs, even though Montreal was not able to add a third goal.Orlando City (4-4-2, 14 points) showed some pushback, but they also began to show some frustration as they earned three of their five yellow cards starting in the game's 74th minute.Montreal goalkeeper Jonathan Sirois and his defensive line earned their third straight clean sheet in the league as he saved both on-target shots he faced Saturday night. Gallese finished with two saves.",
        "The first half saw some chances as Orlando attempted eight shots to Montreal's four. However, neither keeper was truly troubled, and any time there was seemingly trouble, the defenses cleaned up potential messes.--Field Level Media"
