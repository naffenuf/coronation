        "Mikel Arteta has not ruled out William Saliba playing again this season despite his back injury once again sidelining him for Sunday\u2019s trip to Newcastle.",
        "The France international has missed the last seven games as Arsenal\u2019s title bid faltered, with the Gunners having handed the initiative over to Manchester City after a run of one win in five.Saliba\u2019s absence has been felt hard, Arsenal conceding in each of the games he has missed having been involved in every Premier League game before being struck down by a niggling back issue.",
        "Arteta said last week that the recovery was taking longer than expected.\u201cNot a lot of progress,\u201d he said when asked for an update on the injury.\u201cHe\u2019s feeling better every day but he\u2019s not been able to have any activity around the first team so we don\u2019t expect him to be with us (at Newcastle).\u201cIt\u2019s about the healing process; pain-wise and the things he can do off the pitch he\u2019s in a good place, but we have to build that capacity with the right load so that he\u2019s able to contribute to the team.\u201d",
        "Pushed on whether it was time to accept Saliba was out for the season, he added: \u201cWe are not there yet because we\u2019re always hopeful and the players are pushing to play. If that\u2019s the case we\u2019ll announce it, but hopefully not.\u201dArsenal\u2019s defensive injuries could have worsened further still as, with Saliba and Takehiro Tomiyasu sidelined, Gabriel Magalhaes was forced off during Tuesday\u2019s win over Chelsea.",
        "\u201cWe will have to see tomorrow how he is,\u201d Arteta said at his media conference on Friday.\u201cBut he could not finish the game so that was a big sign. We\u2019ll have to see tomorrow.\u201dArsenal could be four points adrift of City by the time they kick off at Newcastle, themselves aiming to push on a secure a third-placed finish this season.The corresponding fixture last season came in the penultimate game of the campaign \u2013 a 2-0 win for Newcastle all-but ending Arsenal\u2019s hopes of Champions League qualification.Arteta, shown in the Amazon \u201cAll or Nothing: Arsenal\u201d documentary, tore into his players after the game at St James\u2019 Park \u2013 but he is not planning to use the damaging defeat as fuel this time around.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s a very different game,\u201d he said.\u201cDifferent players, different game. We\u2019re going to have to play better than last year that\u2019s for sure because we know at home they\u2019ve been really good.\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s too much to motivate from there. There\u2019s a lot of things that we have to do better than that day. The group of players and the way they\u2019re playing there is different.\u201d"
