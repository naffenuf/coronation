        "Zack - who will be called Steel on the series - has been announced as one of the new Gladiators for BBC One's reboot of the beloved 90s show.The budding TV star looks unrecognisable in photos from his school days when he said he did little exericse and often gorged on fast food.He told The Sun:\u00a0'I led a really unhealthy lifestyle. I practically inhaled chocolate and ate McDonald's and KFC \u2014 a family bucket \u2014 five times a week.\u00a0The more fast food I ate, the more I craved it. It was a vicious cycle.'Being overweight makes you feel rubbish. You can't walk or run far so you don't want to exercise and you often end up finding comfort in fast food.'",
        "Zack eventually caught the exercise bug and soon became a devotee of CrossFit, a fitness regimen focused on performing functional movements performed at a high intensity.\u00a0He was named as champion in UK CrossFit in 2020 and will be showcasing his athleticism further on Gladiators.Speaking about joining the show, he said: 'I was inspired by the Gladiators as a child, but never imagined I'd be physically fit enough to be considered a \"superhuman\".'I hope a new generation of fans will look up to me as their new strong, unbreakable hero, Steel.'",
        "Zack was announced alongside professional Exeter Chiefs Rugby Player, Jodie Ounsley, who will be known as Fury on the show.Jodie certainly has the credentials to follow in the footsteps of the mighty Gladiators as she's a former England Women\u2019s Rugby Seven\u2019s player, a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu British Champion and five times World Coal Carrying champion.While Jodie, who is profoundly deaf and wears a cochlear implant, won the title of Deaf Sports Personality of The Year in 2020.Meanwhile, the sportswoman has Gladiators in her blood as her father was a contender on the show back in 2008, and she has been training to outdo him ever since.\u00a0",
        "Jodie is a longtime Gladiators fan, even dressing up as a Gladiator and practicing the games in her living room!\u00a0Sharing her excitement at joining the show, Fury said: 'Watching Gladiators growing up I was always in awe of their strength and power and now I am one!'I hope contenders are ready to feel the Fury!'The two new Gladiators being unveiled comes after the hosts of the reboot show were revealed.Bradley and Barney Walsh will present the BBC show, their latest television project together after The Larkins and\u00a0travel show Bradley &amp; Barney Walsh: Breaking Dad.They are taking over the series after it was originally presented by Ulrika Jonsson\u00a0 and John Fashanu on ITV from 1992-2000.",
        "The new series will feature some of the classic challenges including Duel, Hang Tough and The Eliminator as well as some surprise new tasks.\u00a0Gladiators was always an important show for the Walshes as\u00a0Donna, Bradley's wife and Barney's mother, used to choreograph the cheerleaders.Chase presenter Bradley even appeared on a celebrities vs jockeys Gladiators special in 1997.The father and son regularly visited the original set - and a young Barney took some of his first steps on the floor of the arena.Bradley said: 'Wow! I can't believe that I've been asked to be part of this iconic show. I used to sit backstage, or in the audience, every week watching my wife be part of this juggernaut and now I get to co-host a new version of Gladiators!!!\u00a0'Saturday night family entertainment at its best...Are you ready?!'",
