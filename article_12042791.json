        "Their 1,840-square-foot home took four months to construct, which is about half the time a typical house is built, according to the company.\u00a0But installation took longer for Emily and Barclay as the pandemic was raging and supply shortages and shutdowns affected work crews.\u00a0The house came with all major appliances so all they had to do was furnish it once it was installed on a cliffside off Route 1.\u00a0The home has wooden shiplap paneling on the outside, giving the property a modern feel and large windows to let in a ton of California sunshine.\u00a0It has a small back patio area for entertaining and soft lighting to give a calm and relaxing effect.\u00a0The back patio is connected to the living area with has two sliding glass doors that operate as windows.",
        "Off the living room, in an open concept, is a large dining room table that seats six and a bar light to keep it well-lit - although Mills and Neels won't need it with the amount of natural light flowing in.\u00a0Behind the table is a kitchen with additional bar seating, plenty of quartz counterspace, and stainless steel appliances.\u00a0It also has a home office that is built between two sliding wood doors that can open to create a walkway.\u00a0The spacious primary bedroom has views of the hillside and a connected bathroom that has a standalone tub.\u00a0The home also features an outdoor shower to allow homeowners and guests to rinse off after a dip in the ocean.\u00a0On of the other side of the house, the two other bedrooms operate as Jack-and-Jill rooms that are connected via the bathroom.\u00a0\u00a0"
