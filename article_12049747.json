        "A mother-of-three who noticed her finger had become infected as it was \u201call swollen and green\u201d and was put in an induced coma after a \u201cdevastating\u201d leukaemia diagnosis which left her battling for life has said \u201cit was never an option to give up\u201d.",
        "Now celebrating being almost six years cancer-free, Peppie Scobbie, 53, who lives in Larkhall, South Lanarkshire, said she did not \u201cfeel right\u201d while holidaying in Portugal in July 2017 \u2013 after which she returned home and noticed her finger had gone green and was \u201cswollen\u201d and \u201cthrobbing\u201d.After antibiotics failed to treat the apparent infection, she was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) \u2013 a type of blood cancer \u2013 aged 47, and underwent three \u201cintense\u201d rounds of chemotherapy, which made her hair \u201cfall out in clumps\u201d.",
        "During the first round of treatment, Peppie developed pneumonia and sepsis and was put in an induced coma and on life support, which made doctors question \u201cwhether she was going to make it\u201d.Amazingly, Peppie \u201cbounced back\u201d, completed all three rounds of chemotherapy, and was told she was cancer-free just before Christmas in 2017.Peppie then received a stem cell transplant from her older brother Tom McClure in January 2018 \u2013 a form of treatment for certain types of cancer \u2013 as she knew that if she did not have this, she would \u201crelapse and die\u201d.",
        "Thanks to her treatment, she was able to marry Stevie, a 51-year-old foreman, in 2020, and her brother-turned-donor Tom walked her down the aisle.Now, despite being told she will be in \u201cchronic pain for the rest of her life\u201d and suffering with severe side effects as a result of her medication, she will soon celebrate being six years cancer-free and wishes to share the message that \u201cthere\u2019s light at the end of the tunnel\u201d.",
        "\u201cI have days where I could cry,\u201d Peppie said.\u201cI could lie in my bed at night and cry because it upsets me, and I always say, \u2018Why me? Why did this have to happen to me?\u2019",
        "\u201cBut I want to be here and live a life as best I can, considering what\u2019s against me.\u201cIt was never an option for me to give up; it never ever has been and never ever will be.\u201dPeppie first noticed she \u201cdidn\u2019t feel (herself)\u201d during a holiday in Portugal in July 2017.After returning home and resuming work with her cleaning business, from which she has since retired, Peppie said a client\u2019s dog jumped on her arm and it felt like \u201can electric shock\u201d.",
        "Her arm went \u201cblack and blue\u201d within a matter of hours, which she thought was \u201cstrange\u201d but initially \u201cdidn\u2019t think anything of it\u201d, however, this soon changed.\u201cI dragged myself out my bed every morning to go to work, but I was screaming inside because I just knew there was something not quite right with me,\u201d Peppie said.Peppie then noticed the skin on the middle finger of her left hand had become infected.The finger was \u201cthrobbing\u201d but three courses of antibiotics prescribed by her GP did nothing to alleviate the symptoms.",
        "On August 16 2017, Peppie underwent blood tests and the following day she received a phone call from her doctor saying she had a high white blood cell count and low haemoglobin levels.Just 30 minutes later, she received a second call and was told she had leukaemia.She said she was \u201cdevastated\u201d.",
        "\u201cI felt physically sick\u201d, Peppie said.\u201cYou just read about things like that, and you hear it about other people, but you don\u2019t expect to hear that about yourself.\u201cIt was a bit surreal.\u201dOn August 18, the day after receiving the news, it was confirmed Peppie had AML and she began her first round of chemotherapy.",
        "Peppie said she did not have time to process her thoughts as her \u201cbrain went numb\u201d, but the only question she had in her mind at that time was \u2018am I going to survive this?\u2019\u201d\u201cI just kept thinking, am I going to die?\u201d Peppie continued.\u201cThen I thought, no, don\u2019t put that in your head, because if I start thinking thoughts like that then it\u2019s just going to consume me and it\u2019s going to bring me down.\u201cI tried not to think about the bad side of things, I tried to be positive.\u201d",
        "However, after starting chemotherapy Peppie said she began to develop a temperature.",
        "She was taken to the high-dependency unit where she lost consciousness, before being moved to the intensive care unit (ICU) at University Hospital Monklands \u2013 where she was put in an induced coma and placed on life support for two weeks.It was later discovered she had developed pneumonia and sepsis.",
        "Peppie was visited by her family during this time, and doctors did not know \u201cwhether she was going to make it\u201d, but thankfully, \u201cthe will and the fight was there\u201d.\u201cI was told about a week afterwards that not many people survive and come back up the stairs the way I did,\u201d Peppie said.Peppie then started her second and third rounds of chemotherapy, and while she did not have any major complications, the medication she was taking made her \u201challucinate\u201d and she lost her hair.This led to her shaving her head, which was \u201ca hard pill to take\u201d.",
        "\u201cI couldn\u2019t even look in the mirror because all I could see was this person that had cancer, who was ill, and it took me a long time to see past that person,\u201d she said.By Christmas, Peppie was told she was in remission, which was \u201cthe best outcome\u201d, and she was able to spend time with her family and now-husband.",
        "She was also told that her older brother Tom McClure was the perfect match for a stem cell transplant, and she received this in January 2018.She had another transplant in June, but was then diagnosed with graft versus host disease \u2013 where white blood cells attack the patient\u2019s own body \u2013 causing severe illness and damage to the skin on her feet and hands.",
        "After recovering from this, Peppie married Stevie on February 14 2020, and Tom walked her down the aisle, as their father, Thomas, had passed away from pulmonary fibrosis in 2015.She said she \u201ccouldn\u2019t think of anyone better to stand in for her dad\u201d.Although Peppie is now nearly six years cancer-free, she is still taking numerous medications, including immunosuppressive drugs and steroids.",
        "As a result of taking steroids, Peppie said her gut and mouth have been permanently affected and she develops ulcers; she has avascular necrosis, which affects blood supply to the bone; she has undergone two knee replacements; and she has been diagnosed with osteoporosis \u2013 a condition that weakens bones.She also has blood tests every fortnight and recently underwent two blood transfusions.Although she is in pain \u201cevery single day\u201d, she still goes to aqua-fit classes three times a week, sees her friends, and walks her two dogs, Lily and Cooper.",
        "The grandmother-of-five said her family keep her strong because \u201cthey mean everything to me\u201d, and she hopes that she can offer a \u201cglimmer of hope\u201d to those going through cancer treatment by sharing her story.",
        "\u201cI\u2019m five years post-transplant and I\u2019m still here, I\u2019m still living my life,\u201d she said.\u201cIt\u2019s maybe not the best quality life \u2013 most days it is \u2013 but you\u2019ve just got to cling on to that hope and that positivity to get you there, and obviously have good family and friends to help you achieve that.\u201cThere\u2019s light at the end of the tunnel.\u201dLeukaemia UK is investing in life-changing research into more effective treatments for AML and other types of blood cancer.
