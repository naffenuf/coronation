        "The disastrous marketing bid has seen sales for the American flagship beer plummet 26 percent, despite Anheuser-Busch reporting first-quarter earnings of $1.65billion and with conservatives everywhere professing to boycott the company.The company is seemingly facing outrage and potential boycott from all sides of the political spectrum, though largely centered around conservatives.The partnership with Mulvaney drew intense backlash from some quarters, with musician Kid Rock posting a video of himself shooting at cases of Bud Light, and country singers John Rich and Travis Tritt dropping ties with the brand.But media personalities like Joe Rogan and Howard Stern defended Bud Light's decision.Anheuser-Busch reported first-quarter earnings of $1.65billion, which topped Wall Street expectations.The brewer posted revenue of $14.21 billion in the period, which also beat forecasts, with the shares rising 6 percent since the beginning of the year and 12 percent in 12 months.",
        "It's unclear if the boycott had any impact on these figures, and whether a larger impact on the firm's finances will be visible for the second quarter of the financial year if the controversy and boycotts rumble on.The brewing giants now claim that the beer can and social media posts were not meant to be 'for production or sale to the general public.CEO Michel Doukeris disavowed the advertisement in an earnings call Thursday, insisting the ad was 'not a campaign,' and that an outside agency approved it without approval from Bud Light.\u00a0",
