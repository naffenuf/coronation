But I felt so accomplished,' she said.Kardashian then stated that she had since learned how to use exercise as a confidence-boosting method.'If I'm having a really bad day, I go to the gym. I might not want to go to the gym, but I go and right when I'm done, I feel so much lighter,' she said.She added: 'I've never regretted going to a workout. I've always regretted missing them or pushing the snooze button.'\u00a0"
