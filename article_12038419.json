        "This week, Jaci looks at Eastender's royal knees up for the Coronation\u00a0READ MORE:\u00a0Soap's wackiest wedding!\u00a0EASTENDERS",
        "You can always rely on the Queen Vic to throw a decent royal knees-up, and now that we\u2019ve moved on from the \u2019Er Majesty, Gawd bless \u2019er days, it\u2019s time for the new King to be celebrated.\u00a0And how. The ocean of red, white and blue sees everyone swimming in a giant vat of royal love.It\u2019s not such a good day for Sonia, who wakes up to birthday treats, but no Reiss. Rocky comes close to sharing his suspicions with her, but will he confront Reiss when he turns up?\u00a0And what is Reiss\u2019s secret?\u00a0Apart from where he found earplugs capable of drowning out Sonia\u2019s trumpet-playing. It\u2019s a secret that, when revealed, leaves Sonia devastated, and Reiss desperate to explain himself.Some locals are having a ball, absorbing the historic moment before the entertainment \u2013 both Kim and Felix performing as Dusty Springfield.\u00a0",
        "But there\u2019s less joy for Karen, who doesn\u2019t take well to the news of Keanu and Sharon\u2019s engagement. Maybe she won\u2019t need to worry for many more months\u2026\u00a0Is Keanu the dead body we saw in a recent flash forward to the Vic at Christmas? Or Grant, back for Sharon\u2019s wedding? Or Ian (remember him?), or maybe Vinny, mistaken by Suki for Nish?\u00a0She does have a habit of being responsible for her kids disappearing/dying.\u00a0",
        "EastEnders\u2019 game of Musical Landladies continues with the arrival of Harriet Thorpe as Linda\u2019s mum, Elaine. \u2018She\u2019s funny, fearless, forthright and has a big heart. It\u2019s a fulfilling role,\u2019 says Harriet.",
        "While it will obviously be a case of mistaken identity, the suspense is torture, but take heart \u2013 there are only 232 guessing days to Christmas!Nish and Suki are in for a shock with Linda sneaking around behind their backs and talking about cash to a mystery caller.\u00a0When she reveals her plans for the Vic to Sharon, a huge fight breaks out before the new co-owner is revealed \u2013 Linda\u2019s mum, Elaine.Quickly making her presence felt, Elaine charms some punters and puts others in their place. Will Nish\u2019s intimidation tactics work on her? And is he behind the trashing of the Vic? Welcome to Walford.More excitement beckons as Kaffy begins planning her Eurovision-themed birthday bash. One request: please, under no circumstances let Kim sing again.CORONATION STREETDid Daisy ever stop loving Ryan?\u00a0It\u2019s the question to ask as she continues the charade of being \u2018Crystal\u2019 in order to cheer Ryan up.\u00a0When he says he\u2019s going to visit his crush in Ibiza, Daisy has to deter him, and when they go for a walk, followed by a drink in the Rovers, he thanks her for making him face his demons.",
        "It\u2019s ironic given that not long ago Daisy was the devil incarnate. Her personality transplant was obviously a means to keep Charlotte Jordan, who plays her, in Weatherfield. Quite right, too; she\u2019s terrific.It becomes clear that Ryan and Daisy have deeper feelings for each other, though given the appalling quality of drinks in the Rovers, you could bond with a stoat across the table.\u00a0",
        "When Daniel finds Daisy\u2019s spare phone to give to Max to record anything that\u2019s bothering him, it seems as if the game might be up for \u2018Crystal\u2019.\u00a0What is the message Max hears that alerts him to the fact Ryan is in danger? Not as much danger as I suspect Daisy might be in if Daniel\u2019s jealousy raises its ugly head.The same fate probably awaits Sarah, if Adam discovers her passion for Damon. Yes, she\u2019s at it again, this time in the Bistro office. What is it with her and offices?\u00a0Barely two minutes have passed since she was seducing Adam over his desk. It\u2019d be surprising if she didn\u2019t have the imprint of a stapler on her back.Big questions for Daniel...Where\u2019s Bertie \u2013 and has he been fed this year? It\u2019s one of many questions surrounding Corrie\u2019s Daniel, played by Rob Mallard.\u00a0",
        "Come on, Daniel! Give the lad a rusk! He\u2019s more concerned about Max, when he sees the youngster\u2019s phone video diary.\u00a0Rob says, \u2018Daniel sees that suddenly this person who was so set on destroying him is now in such a weak and vulnerable position, and it\u2019s quietly tragic.\u2019He won\u2019t be so fluffily nice if and when he discovers Daisy\u2019s resurrected feelings for Ryan.EMMERDALE\u00a0Has Mack finally let the cat out of the bag?You\u2019d have to have been living under a rock not to realise how strangely Mack\u2019s been acting. He\u2019s been lurking with the kind of expression you\u2019d expect from a Scotsman in a kilt \u2013 in a hurricane.\u00a0When he visits Reuben at hospital and is told the baby doesn\u2019t have brain damage, his emotions give him away.\u00a0When Charity turns up for a surprise\u00a0visit, the penny drops for Charity. Well, not so much a penny as a Royal Mint of loose change that threatens to take her head off.Poor Charity. She hasn\u2019t had much luck with men. Or women. Or kids. Or work. In Mack she appeared to have found a partner and true love, but he turned out to be a mirage of Scotch mist.\u00a0Where now for her? Back to Cain, her real soulmate, I reckon.",
        "Or Paddy? He\u2019s free and clearly has a penchant for Dingle women. Note to Paddy: there are females other than Dingles.\u00a0He\u2019s probably too busy \u2018finding himself\u2019 at the moment and attends a Man Club outside the village. It\u2019s an adventurous start, though clearly not a hunting expedition for women.\u00a0Finding the courage to speak, he shares his troubles with an understanding group. Who knew there were so many right-on men in the Dales? There are now almost as many as there are lesbians.\u00a0Thank goodness for the eternal bit of rough that is Cain."
