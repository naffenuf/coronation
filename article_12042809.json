        "First Minister Humza Yousaf has come under fire after failing to attend Holyrood for a debate on transparency within the SNP.",
        "Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross accused the SNP, which has been in power for 16 years in Scotland, of \u201csecrecy, spin and cover ups\u201d.He said while Mr Yousaf has been \u201chappy\u201d to answer questions from the press, he is unwilling to give a statement to MSPs about the turmoil within Scotland\u2019s governing party.With a police investigation into the SNP finances ongoing and following the resignation of senior figures in the party after the media was misled about membership numbers, the Tories brought forward a debate in Holyrood calling on the First Minister to make a statement about SNP governance.Mr Ross said such matters are in the \u201cpublic interest and should be properly scrutinised and debated in the national Parliament\u201d.Insisting there are still \u201ccrucial questions\u201d to be answered \u201cweeks into this sorry saga\u201d, the Scottish Tory leader said Mr Yousaf should answer questions from fellow MSPs.",
        "Mr Ross said: \u201cThe First Minister seems quite happy to answer these questions outside the chamber. He always stops to speak to the press to give his views on a whole host of issues.\u201cIf the First Minister is happy to give those answers to the press just a few metres from this chamber, why is he not happy to come in here to answer those questions?",
        "\u201cNot just is he unwilling to answer questions in this chamber, he is unwilling to even attend today to respond to these points.\u201cToday marks 16 years since the SNP were elected into Government.\u201cDuring that time we have seen secrecy, spin and cover ups from the heart of Government.\u201cToday is an opportunity for SNP members to say enough is enough.\u201dWith Mr Yousaf absent from the chamber, parliamentary business minister George Adam spoke for the Government.He made clear that \u201ctransparency and scrutiny of this Government is important\u201d, and he hit out at the Tories over their own refusal to reveal their current membership figures \u2013 saying Mr Ross\u2019s party \u201cwon\u2019t practice what they are trying to preach\u201d.Mr Adam added: \u201cThe absolute hypocrisy from the Conservatives is almost laughable. You just cannot take the Tories seriously on this issue  George Adam, parliamentary business minister  \u201cYou\u00a0have to admire someone who has that level of brass neck, to complain about a lack of transparency when you lead the Scottish Conservative Party.\u201dHe recalled how the Conservatives at Westminster had \u201cillegally prorogued the UK Parliament to avoid debate and scrutiny\u201d, and he said that at the Scottish Conservative conference last weekend Prime Minister Rishi Sunak would \u201conly agree to speak to the Scottish press if he could handpick the media\u201d.",
        "Mr Adam continued: \u201cThe Tories come to us here in the Scottish Parliament and they talk about our integrity.\u201cThis party, the Conservatives, have received hundreds of thousands of pounds from unincorporated associations that do not reveal their origin of funding, and they question the integrity of others.\u201cYou just cannot take the Tories seriously on this issue.\u201dHe also noted that \u201cwithin days\u201d of being elected SNP leader, Mr Yousaf had announced a review of governance within the party.The minister told MSPs: \u201cI am not going to stand here and claim that there are not issues in the SNP which need to be addressed.\u201cBut I can stand here and say these issues are going to be addressed.\u201d"
