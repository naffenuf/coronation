        "BRIGHTON, England (AP) - Everton scored after 34 seconds on its way to a surprising 5-1 win at Europe-chasing Brighton that lifted the team out of the English Premier League relegation zone on Monday.",
        "Abdoulaye Doucoure converted the 10th first-minute goal in the league this season and volleyed home a second in the 29th to give Everton a dream start at Amex Stadium.It got even better for the visitors when a cross from Dwight McNeil, who set up Doucoure\u00b4s second goal, deflected in off the heel of Brighton goalkeeper Jason Steele for an own-goal in the 35th.McNeil got his goal in the 76th when he dribbled around Steele at the end of a length-of-the-field counterattack as Everton powered into a scarcely believable four-goal lead against a team that started the game with an outside shot at Champions League qualification.Argentina midfielder Alexis Mac Allister grabbed a 79th-minute consolation for Brighton, which stayed in seventh place and eight points off the top four with a game in hand. There was still time for another goal by McNeil - a rising shot inside the near post in stoppage time that capped a brilliant performance from the winger.After beginning the day in next-to-last place, Everton will finish it two points above the relegation zone and with renewed hope of extending its 69-year stay in England\u00b4s top division, with games still to come against Manchester City, Wolverhampton and Bournemouth to close the season.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"
