        "Joseph Suaalii signed a three-year deal with Rugby Australia in MarchRoosters is under contract until 2024 and will switch codes in 2025Nick Politis dismissed rumours the Roosters could release Suaalii this year\u00a0Roosters boss Nick Politis has dismissed rumours Joseph Suaalii could leave the NRL this season and join the Wallabies ahead of schedule.",
        "On Monday, Nine News reported the Tricolours were considering cutting ties with the 19-year-old before his contract expires at the end of next season.\u00a0Suaalii will switch codes in 2025 after\u00a0agreeing a three-year deal worth $1.6million-a-year with Rugby Australia\u00a0in March and releasing him now would save the Roosters $700,000 on the salary cap for next season.Politis, however, insisted the Samoa international would not be leaving Bondi Beach until his deal runs out.'We have no plans to release him at this stage. The final say on recruitment is always with Robbo anyway. [Trent Robinson],' he told News Corp.",
        "'He\u2019s working very hard with all the players to turn things around for our next game.'One of the most talented players in the NRL, Suaalii has struggled to live up to his potential since his deal with Rugby Australia became public.According to Nine News, Suaalii's recent lack of form could be a factor if the Roosters decided to release him.\u00a0Politis, however, insisted the teenager could not be blamed 'for the way the team is performing' after the Tricolours lost 20-6 against the Cowboys in Magic Round.Meanwhile, Rugby Australia chairman Hamish McLennan said the Wallabies would happily take Suaalii immediately if the opportunity arose.'We\u2019d take him straight away,' he told Nine. 'We made a good profit this year.",
        "'We\u2019ll make $100million out of the [2025 British and Irish] Lions [tour] and another $100million out of the World Cup. Everything is heading in the right direction.'So we could afford to take him now and we\u2019d be delighted to take him earlier if league didn\u2019t want him.'",
        "Suaalii's switch is rugby's biggest coup out of the NRL in two decades, after Mat Rogers, Wendell Sailor and Lote Tuqiri all crossed codes in the early 2000s\u00a0during Eddie Jones' first stint in charge of the Wallabies.Since replacing Dave Rennie in charge of the Wallabies in January, the 63-year-old\u00a0has bullishly suggested he may raid league\u00a0to convince some of the game's biggest stars to move to rugby union.\u00a0Suaalii's defection to rugby has reignited a feud between the codes, with\u00a0NRL boss Peter V'Landys accusing the Sydney Roosters gun of chasing 'easy money'\u00a0and Canterbury supremo Phil Gould suggesting\u00a0Suaalii would be better off making an immediate move.McLennan has returned fire by\u00a0branding the NRL 'cry babies'\u00a0and last month it emerged he held a secret meeting with Suaalii in Sydney, a move which raised questions about the latter's commitment to the Roosters."
