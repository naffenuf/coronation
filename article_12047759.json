Magazine - saying this one feels 'true to who she is'.\u00a0\u00a0She said: 'I think the wedding we are going ahead with this summer is much more true to who I am and who Brad is and it reflects our personalities a lot more.'We've stood our ground and reduced the guest list quite drastically and I feel way better about it.'On whether she is a Bridezilla, she added: 'I can feel myself dreaming about the wedding more and as the days get close I can feel it rising up inside me. But I wouldn't say it's in my character to be a bridezilla.\u00a0",
        "Elsewhere in the chat, on if she will cry on the big day she answered: 'I've known Brad for seven years and I've seen him cry once But I reckon he could be more emotional than me!'It comes after last month it was first revealed that the couple's nuptials and the build-up to their wedding will be in the ITV show.After postponing their wedding a number of times due to the pandemic and Bradley, being injured, the couple are finally set to walk down the aisle in June and their fanbase will have the chance to see all the action unfold.",

        "'But filming the buildup to their nuptials will be so special because they will be doing it together, plus they will always have the memories captured to look back on.'Olivia met Bradley in a nightclub before she starred on Love Island, but the couple found their way back together and have been engaged since the footballer popped the question in 2019.A number of setbacks prevented the pair from sealing the deal, with Olivia revealing to MailOnline in November 2021 that she and Bradley cancelled their 2022 wedding because neither of them wanted to rush making important decisions.\u00a0",
        "Olivia listed several reasons including the pressure on her shoulders with work commitments, Bradley's football schedule and recovering from his injury, plus needing time on their side for their stag and hen dos.\u00a0\u00a0But after three years of planning, they are set to marry in an idyllic ceremony and Olivia's dress, which she's had in her possession for months, will finally be worn.\u00a0Olivia and Bradley live together in Manchester with their dogs Lola and Stitch and even share matching tattoos in tribute to their 'first babies.'Olivia, who's amassed over 2million followers on Instagram since starring on Love Island in 2017, became the first former Islander to sign up to I'm A Celeb last year.",
        "The star's time on the show was short-lived after she was forced to quit the series when a blood test showed that was anaemic, causing concern among ITV bosses.She was rushed to A&amp;E and denied access back into the Australian jungle, with many viewers believing the engaged star discovered she was pregnant while in camp.\u00a0The real reason was that she had 'dangerously low potassium levels' and producers couldn't take the risk in allowing her to participate in the series.\u00a0Since the ordeal, Olivia admitted she struggled with flying back to the UK while her jungle co-stars including winner Jill Scott and former Radio 1 DJ Chris Moyles continued to take part, after feeling as though she missed out on the opportunity.\u00a0"
