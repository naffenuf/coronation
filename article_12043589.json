        "She was the epitome of glamour at the Met Gala on Monday night.",
        "And Gisele Bundchen put comfort first as she jetted to Miami the following day.The supermodel, 42, carried a marble print pillow as she took a flight into the city on Tuesday.She was seen making her way through the airport, her pillow looking like a stylish accessory to her already fashionable look.Gisele wore a distressed leather jacket with fur trimming, a basic white T-shirt, and skinny jeans.",
        "She topped off the look with a black baseball cap worn over her long beachy waves.The catwalk queen wheeled a chic suitcase through the airport and elevated the look with a Chanel bag thrown over her arm.Gisele strode outside in black sneakers, a far cry from the heels she wore on Monday evening, before entering a car awaiting her outside.Monday night's Met Gala was the first time Gisele had attended the ball in four years.It also marked the first time she had appeared at the gala without her ex-husband Tom Brady since 2007.During her solo appearance, she looked heavenly in a stunning white ensemble from the Chanel archive, according to Vogue.Brady was still just her boyfriend when they attended the event for the first time together back in 2008.The latest sighting comes weeks after she admitted she still loved her former spouse but that they'd simply 'grown apart' after 13 years of marriage and two children together.",
        "Gisele and the NFL superstar announced in October 2022 that they had decided 'amicably' to divorce and that they did so after 'much consideration.'It was filed and finalized on October 28.'We are blessed with beautiful and wonderful children who will continue to be the center of our world in every way. We will continue to work together as parents to always ensure they receive the love and attention they deserve,' the Super Bowl champ wrote on Instagram.In her own statement, the runway maven also put an emphasis on their children's wellbeing and that they've both vowed to 'give them the love, care and attention they greatly deserve.'She also expressed gratitude for the time her and Tom spent together as a married couple.",
        "'The decision to end a marriage is never easy but we have grown apart and while it is, of course, difficult to go through something like this, I feel blessed for the time we had together and only wish the best for Tom always,' Gisele concluded.It came after months of rumors that the pair's relationship had turned rocky following Tom's decision to un-retire from football just 40 days after announcing he would be leaving his NFL career behind.He officially retired from the sport - which earned him seven Super Bowl rings after playing for 23 season - in February 2023.",
        "In a March interview with Vanity Fair, Gisele refuted claims that she gave the football pro an ultimatum forcing him to choose their relationship over his sporting career.She said she found the rumors 'very hurtful' and insisted that she has only ever 'wanted all his dreams to come true.'The couple co-parent son Benjamin, 13, and daughter Vivian, 10. Tom also shares 15-year-old son John Edward with ex Bridget Moynahan, 52."
