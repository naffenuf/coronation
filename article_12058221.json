        "Chelsea have moved to ease injury fears over Matildas superstar Sam Kerr after the striker played barely half an hour of their 7-0 win over Everton.",
        "Kerr scored a header in the 25th minute on Sunday but was withdrawn seven minutes later, sparking injury concerns about Australia's talismanic captain less than two-and-a-half months out from the home Women's World Cup.But manager Emma Hayes said Kerr had been dealing with calf cramp after being ill on Saturday night.\"Sam was sick last night,\" Hayes said on Sunday after the 7-0 win over Everton that moved Chelsea into second place in the English Women's Super League.\"She decided to play but her calf was cramping up so we decided to take her out.\"Kerr, who has 10 goals and four assists from 18 WSL games this season, had spent Saturday at the coronation of King Charles III in London, carrying the Australian flag in the procession into Westminster Abbey.The Matildas will be sweating on yet another injury concern to vice-captain Steph Catley, who played just 16 minutes in Arsenal's 1-0 win over Leicester City on Saturday.Catley entered the game as a 58th-minute substitute but was forced off in the 74th with a groin/hamstring concern.The gun left-back was sidelined earlier this season with a foot injury, and previously had a run of calf strains and a serious hamstring tear in her time at Arsenal.Teammate Caitlin Foord remains sidelined with the hamstring injury suffered on April 2.",
        "Teen sensation Mary Fowler missed Manchester City's loss to Liverpool on Sunday.Ahead of the match, City manager Gareth Taylor said Fowler had \"taken a heavy fall\" in their previous game against Reading and required assessment.Taylor said luckless defender Alanna Kennedy was \"getting a little bit closer\" to a return but was more likely to suit up for City's final two games."
