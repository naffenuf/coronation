        "Australian golf ace Gabriela Ruffels has all but secured her LPGA Tour card with a record-setting victory on the secondary Epson Tour in America.",
        "Ruffels, a former US Women's Amateur Champion, won the Garden City Charity Classic in Kansas with a record 19-under-par 197 total.The 23-year-old carded a final-round 71 to finish four shots clear of Mexican runner-up Isabella Fierro (62) and cap a record-breaking week in Garden City.Ruffels started by breaking the course record with a 10-under 62 - and that was just the beginning.When she posted her second-round 64 to power to 18 under, Ruffels broke a 20-year, 36-hole Epson Tour scoring record.Despite her big lead heading into the final round, Ruffels still felt the tension.\"I was definitely very nervous, but I knew I had a big buffer which really helped,\" she said.\"\"I just tried to play every shot as it was and not get too ahead of myself.\"I was trying to play super-consistent today and I was able to do that, so I was very happy.\"\"It is really cool. It is always good when you are setting records and hopefully there are more to come,\" Ruffels said of finishing on the magical 19 under number.After six events, Ruffels has a significant lead in the Race for the Card standings.The top 10 at season's end will progress to the lucrative LPGA Tour in 2024.",
        "\"My game is good right now,\" Ruffels said. \"This win is a big step in the right direction.\"We are all out here for the same reason and that is to get to the next level on the LPGA Tour.\"There is still a long season to go but I am definitely making some strides.\""
