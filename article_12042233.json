        "The rental market is the toughest it's been in years - with up to 20 people bidding for a single apartment in some cities\u00a0The national occupancy rate is nearly 95 percent - and 60 percent of those renters renewed their leases,\u00a0leaving very little room to move aroundAbout 44 million Americans rent, according to Census data, and many could be in for a shock as prices are set to go even higherAmericans are facing one of the toughest markets in years - with up to 20\u00a0prospective renters per single apartment in some cities.",
        "The Northeast is ground zero in the battle for a new apartment, as inflation,\u00a0interest rate hikes and cost of living pressures shatter the home ownership dreams of many Millennials and\u00a0Gen Zers.Almost half of the 20 most competitive markets for renting in 2023 are in the Northeast, with North Jersey topping the list,\u00a0according to Rent Caf\u00e9,\u00a0which analyzed 134 markets across the U.S.\u00a0The Sunbelt states also feature prominently in the data, which was compiled using factors such as the number of days apartments were vacant and the number of prospective renters.\u00a0",
        "Occupancy rates currently sit at nearly 95 percent, while 60 percent of those renters renewed their leases, leaving Americans with very little opportunity to move around.With an average of eight prospective buyers per apartment, and units only staying on the market for a little over a month, renters are pulling their hair out trying to find a safe, clean, and affordable place to live - especially in the Northeast.That high demand could partly be a result of New York renters getting\u00a0sticker shock from exorbitant renewal rates for shoe boxes in the city,\u00a0where one-bedrooms are now going for an average of $5,000 per month.\u00a0Post-pandemic price increases\u00a0saw a surge of people leaving the bright lights. And even more may soon follow them, forced to flee a city they can no longer afford, as the Rent Guidelines Board recently voted to increase rents by up to seven percent in almost one million rent-stabilized apartments,\u00a0according to The New York Times.\u00a0",
        "Many former New Yorkers have moved to Northern Jersey instead. The area has a relatively affordable cost of living for the tri-state area and is the easiest place in the Northeast for homebuyers to have a shot at a white picket fence.But, with 96.6 percent of rentals occupied, it leaves little room for new arrivals to find their dream place.On average, 12 prospective residents will battle it out for a coveted spot, which has led to about 72 percent of renters choosing to renew their lease.\u00a0Most of the other competitive markets are also in the Northeast, with Boston; Brooklyn; Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; Suburban Philadelphia; Pittsburgh; and New Haven all on the list.\u00a0",
        "Florida, once the most popular place to flock to, holds several spots in the top 20, including the number two spot in Miami-Dade County, where apartments spend an average of 33 days on the market before being snatched up.\u00a0Also ranking in for the Sunshine State are Southwest Florida at number six, Broward County at number eight, and Orlando at number nine.\u00a0A few major cities across the Midwest, Great Plains, and the South made the list, including Omaha, Milwaukee, and Kansas City.\u00a0Despite the housing and rental market nightmare, it is faring slightly better than last year. Prospective renters battling for each apartment have dropped from an average 11 to eight, while places are sitting on the market for an average of six days longer - at 38 days.\u00a0",
        "The occupancy rate has dropped more than one percent compared to 2022 as four percent more renters are looking to not resign their lease this year compared to the same time last year.\u00a0Even places such as Orlando and Miami, which has seen a boom in new apartment complexes being built, can't keep up with demand, especially as New Yorkers continue to eye new and exciting places in the income tax-free state.\u00a0Only Milwaukee and Central New Jersey were able to keep up with demand, according to Rent Caf\u00e9.\u00a0Brooklyn pulled the 14th spot, with a lot of newcomers flocking to the trendy borough in recent years thanks to its reputation for having cheaper rent than Manhattan.",
        "New developments only amount to a sliver of the nation's rental market, at less than one percent.New York City has seen a boom of new apartment buildings soaring into its skyline throughout 2022, but they only added up to roughly 0.3 percent of units available on the market.\u00a0Roughly 66 percent of renters in Brooklyn renewed their lease and an average apartment in the borough lasted about 45 days on the market.\u00a0\u00a0With inflation stealing every penny,\u00a0even those making more than $150,000 a year are struggling to purchase a home\u00a0- a fact that is also contributing to increased demand for rentals.",
        "The number of households rented by people making more than $150,000 in the US spiked to more than three million between 2016 and 2021, a staggering 87 percent increase, numbers from the US Census Bureau showed.Experts warned that the rental market's turnover and supply leads to a much more competitive environment, meaning current trends towards supplying the wealthy with apartments is driving up rental costs.\u00a0In total there were about 44 million rented households by the end of 2021, the Census found, with the median income sitting at $71,000."
