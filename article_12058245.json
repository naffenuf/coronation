        "MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) - Veteran Brooklyn Nets point guard Patty Mills and rising Oklahoma City star Josh Giddey are among the 10 NBA players selected in Australia\u00b4s extended squad of 18 to prepare for the basketball World Cup.",
        "Mills' teammate Ben Simmons is still recovering from injury and wasn\u00b4t picked for the squad\u00b4s upcoming training camp, but coach Brian Goorjian hasn\u00b4t ruled him out of calculations for the global tournament.Matisse Thybulle, Joe Ingles, Jock Landale, Josh Green, Matthew Dellavedova, Xavier Cooks, Jack White and Dyson Daniels are the other NBA players picked for the extended roster, which will be cut to 12 before Australia\u00b4s opening game against co-host Japan on Aug. 25.\"It\u00b4s been a thorough process. The coaches and I have had many discussions about getting the mix right but I\u00b4m really pleased with where we\u00b4ve landed with the guys we\u00b4ve selected, there\u00b4s a good balance across the court,\" Goorjian said in a statement Monday. \"The fact it\u00b4s been so tough goes to show the depth of talent we have in Australian basketball right now.\"Australia won the bronze medal at the Tokyo Olympics and will again be among the medal contenders in the FIBA World Cup, which is being co-hosted by Philippines, Japan and Indonesia.The Boomers have been drawn into Pool E with Japan, Germany and Finland and will play their group-stage games in Okinawa.Giddey, who was among the last players cut from the Olympic roster for Tokyo, will get his first chance to play for Australia at a major international meet.",
        "\"I\u00b4ve always dreamed of playing for the Boomers and representing Australia, so to get this opportunity is really special,\" Giddey said. \"There\u00b4s a lot of talent in this squad and I think we\u00b4ve got a good chance of matching it with every team -- I\u00b4m excited for the challenge.\"___Australia squad: Xavier Cooks, Dyson Daniels, Matthew Dellavedova, Dante Exum, Sam Froling, Josh Giddey, Chris Goulding, Josh Green, Joe Ingles, Nick Kay, Jock Landale, Thon Maker, Will McDowell-White, Patty Mills, Keanu Pinder, Duop Reath, Matisse Thybulle, Jack White.___AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"
