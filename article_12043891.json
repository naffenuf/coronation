        "Manchester City striker Erling Haaland broke the record for most goals scored in a Premier League season with his 35th of the campaign against West Ham on Wednesday.",
        "His feat is even more impressive as the record of 34 was set in the league\u2019s early 42-game seasons by Andy Cole and Alan Shearer.Here, the PA news agency looks at how Haaland compares.",
        "Andy Cole, Newcastle, 1993-94",
        "Appearances: 40 Goals: 34 Assists: 13Cole scored only once in the first four games but got 15 in the next 12, including all the goals in a 3-0 win over Liverpool and doubles against Sheffield Wednesday, West Ham and Oldham.Another hat-trick against Coventry and a standout performance in the return game with the Hammers, with a goal and three assists in a 4-2 win, were further highlights of his season. His 13 assists also led the Premier League as Newcastle finished third, making him the only man until Harry Kane in 2020-21 to top both charts outright.Alan Shearer, Blackburn, 1994-95",
        "Appearances: 42 Goals: 34 Assists: 13Shearer was ever-present as he equalled Cole\u2019s record and led Blackburn to the title \u2013 like Cole, completing his tally with a goal on the final day of the season. He scored three hat-tricks \u2013 all in 3-0 wins at Ewood Park, against QPR, West Ham and Ipswich \u2013 and four doubles in his second of three straight 30-goal seasons.He matched Cole\u2019s assists tally as well, ranking third in the top flight as he and strike partner Chris Sutton combined to set each other up on 13 occasions, a record broken by Kane two years ago in tandem with Spurs team-mate Son Heung-min.",
        "Erling Haaland, Manchester City, 2022-23",
        "Appearances: 31 Goals: 35 Assists: 7Haaland wasted no time making his mark in the Premier League \u2013 scoring two goals on his debut against West Ham, a record nine in his first five games and 15 in nine. He has four hat-tricks to his name and one more will equal Shearer\u2019s record of five in a season set in his 31-goal 1995-96 campaign.His record-equalling penalty against Fulham at Craven Cottage last weekend brought up his half-century in all competitions, having scored 12 goals in eight Champions League appearances and four in the domestic cups, with his strike against the Hammers sending him clear in Premier League history.Haaland\u2019s league assist tally, though in single figures, still ranks joint-sixth in the top flight this season, defying scrutiny of his perceived one-dimensional role in Pep Guardiola\u2019s side.Roll of honour",
        "Haaland began hauling in previous Golden Boot-winning tallies as early as November 5 after 18 goals in his first 12 games.The 23-goal mark that has won the last three awards lasted only until January\u2019s hat-trick against Wolves, which accounted for nine previous Golden Boot seasons in all, while he matched Mohamed Salah\u2019s 38-game record of 32 in just 28 appearances.18 goals \u2013 Michael Owen, Dion Dublin and Chris Sutton 1997-98; Owen, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and Dwight Yorke 1998-99 Appearances: 12 v Fulham (H), November 5",
