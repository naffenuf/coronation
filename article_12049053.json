        "Every window was smashed in and almost every wall was left with gaping walls at the property in Mango Hill, north of Brisbane.The vandals took to the home over the Labour Day long weekend, causing thousands of dollars in damage.Black, white and red spray paint covered the kitchen bench, walls and floors, with almost every surface defaced.",
        "The homeowner - who did not want to be named - told 7News 'It's been a tough few days' and they no longer know if they feel safe moving into the area.'My partner can't even come and look at the house because it's just so devastating,' they said.'The footage indicates they are in the youth category and it is absolutely ridiculous. There's no accountability.'We're at breaking point now in terms of what we're supposed to do as a community to stop these people.",
        "The couple were set to move in next month, with the house being under construction since September.Neighbours say the new estate has repeatedly been targetted by vandals with multiple sites defaced.It comes as just one suburb over Emma Lovell, 41, died last year when she and her husband defended their North Lakes home from teenagers.She was fatally stabbed in her home on Boxing Day, allegedly by two teenage intruders.",
        "Queensland Police said it is investigating the incident."
