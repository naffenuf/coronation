        "World Naked Gardening Day is an annual event which first started in 2005West Valley City in Utah was laid bare as the worst place for naked gardening200 cities were compared based on factors such as indecent exposure laws\u00a0\u00a0If you've ever considered tending to your tulips in the buff, now you can find out where the best place would be to do so.\u00a0",
        "To mark World Naked Gardening Day on May 6, the best cities for nude gardening have been uncovered.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Miami, Florida, has been unveiled as the best city for naked gardening in 2023, with Austin, Texas coming in second and Atlanta Georgia in third place, according to LawnStarter.\u00a0Given it is not known for its balmy weather, it might be a surprise to see that Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was awarded fourth place.\u00a0Out of the ranking of the 200 biggest cities in the US, West Valley City in Utah came in last as the worst place in the country to strip off and trim the hedges.",
        "LawnStarter used 12 metrics in total to judge the cities, including\u00a0nudist population size, indecent exposure laws, and gardener-friendliness.\u00a0",
        "1. Miami, Fla2.\u00a0Austin, Texas3. Atlanta, Ga4. Philadelphia, Penn5. Los Angeles, Calif6. Orange, Calif7. Pasadena, Calif8. Seattle, Wash9. Houston, Texas10. Raleigh, N.C",
        "It also considered weather forecasts, access to waxing salons and sex offender listings.Each city was given a score out of 100 in order to determine its rank, and a full list of all 200 cities can be found on the outlet.According to the data, Florida's cities are not shy about baring some skin - with four of the five cities with the most nudists located in the Sunshine State.\u00a0",
        "Many of the places at the rear end of the list are cold, northern cities, which have a chilly forecast for May 6, including\u00a0Sioux Falls, South Dakota, St. Paul, Minnesota and Anchorage, Alaska.\u00a0Second and third place Austin and Atlanta, however, scores highly for weather forecast.World Naked Gardening Day, which began in 2005, is an international event celebrated by gardeners and non-gardeners alike at the beginning of May.\u00a0It was founded by Mark Storey, consulting editor of Nude &amp; Natural magazine and permaculturalist Jacob Gabriel.\u00a0",

        "Exposing more than your green thumb is generally illegal in public places in the US.\u00a0Nudity is also generally illegal on a person\u2019s own property if the person is visible to the public, such as through an open window or sunbathing naked in someone's yard.\u00a0An actual violation depends on\u00a0a prosecutor\u2019s interpretation of 'indecent exposure,' which varies state to state.\u00a0It can be vague, and violations are often a matter of community standards for indecency.\u00a0According to the outlet, only a handful of cities are singled out by legal information sources as 'nudist-friendly.'",
        "One such state is Seattle, the birthplace of\u00a0World Naked Gardening Day and home to Storey, the holiday\u2019s cofounder.\u00a0Austin and Philadelphia also rate highly for 'nude gardener friendliness' which is made up of several factors including nudists per 1,000 residents, local legality of public nudity and hair removal services per square mile.\u00a0Arizona, on the other hand, has some of the strictest penalties for state public nudity violations.\u00a0",
        "LawnStarter also judged the safety of places for naked gardening through considering how many sex offenders there were per 100,000 residents.\u00a0It found that nude gardeners from\u00a0Santa Clarita, California, had the least to worry about as the\u00a0city registered the fewest sex offenders per capita of all 200 cities across the US."
