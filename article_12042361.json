        "Christina Ricci says rising to fame aged nine made her 'obnoxious' as she struggled to cope with being a child star.\u00a0",
        "The actress had her breakout role as Wednesday Addams in The Addams Family back in 1991, which paved the way for a three decade career in the industry.\u00a0In a new interview on the\u00a0Reign with Josh Smith podcast, Christina reflects on dealing with being in the spotlight at such a young age and finds it 'amazing' she is securing huge roles now aged 43.\u00a0Christina is back for series two of Yellowjackets, where she plays ruthless nurse Misty Quigley in the\u00a0time-hopping plane crash drama.\u00a0But when she first started out as a child actor, she admits she didn't cope with the glaring spotlight in the best way.\u00a0",
        "'Some people deal better with fame than other people and some people have more supportive families than other people,' she says.\u00a0'And I do think that having a \"famous child\" is a weird pressure to put on a child.\u00a0'I think it's - and I always thought this when I was younger - when being asked questions about who I was before I knew who I was, I knew that that was not helpful as a kid, which is probably why I was so obnoxious in interviews all the time\u2026\u00a0'I find it interesting because anytime I do work with someone who has been a child actor, they are the most professional people on set. They are the people that understand the sacrifices that are going to have to be made. They're always the most prepared, they're always the most adaptable, as far as working with them.'",
        "Christina says having to audition when she was just seven helped her deal with rejection and she deals with it better in her professional career than in her personal life.\u00a0'I think professionally I'm actually very good at being rejected,' she says. 'I mean, you might be p****d off for an afternoon or a day, but I've never been somebody who lets it destroy me.\u00a0'I feel like real life, your personal life is so much more difficult. My personal life is more difficult and requires a lot more of my focus and I emotionally react to it more than my professional life.'\u00a0Christina finalised her divorce from film producer James Heerdegen in December last year, two years after their bitter split. They have a son, Freddie, eight.\u00a0",
        "She married\u00a0Mark Hampton in 2021 and welcomed daughter Cleopatra.\u00a0\u00a0Elsewhere in the interview, Christina discusses\u00a0ageism within the industry.And the actress says she has a confidence with where she is at in life and doesn't doubt herself with getting a part just because she's in her forties.\u00a0'I don't feel old, so I don't feel like, \"oh, for my age I can't believe I'm getting this amazing part in Yellowjackets,' she tells Josh.\u00a0\u00a0'You know, I'm 43 and in most professions, that is the age where you do achieve CEO or all of those things.\u00a0",
        "'So to me it doesn't feel like, \"um, amazing that I'm in my forties and this is happening\".\u00a0'I feel more like just really lucky to have a character that is so creatively inspiring\u2026 We have a whole cast in Yellowjackets of 20 somethings and then a whole cast of 40 year old women and it's great.\u00a0'I think there's still tons of content that reflects, sort of the attitudes of old but thankfully I think with the creation of all these streaming platforms, there needed to be so much content created that it let in a lot of different kinds of voices and perspectives.'\u00a0Talking about what's in store for series two of Yellowjackets, Christina says it's the most shocking yet.\u00a0'I think the way season two ends is really surprising and shocking and I didn't see it coming at all,' she says.\u00a0'It hasn't come out yet, so I can't spoil anything or talk about it. But that was the biggest storyline that really I was just like, \"oh wow.\" It's really, really intense.'\u00a0"
