        "\u00a0For all the latest Royal news, pictures and video click hereDespite my concerns about his obvious wokery and dangerous interventions into politics, I desperately want Charles III to succeed and, as a proud royalist, will happily pledge allegiance on Saturday to our new King.I also believe Queen Camilla is a kind and well-intentioned woman with a good soul who never asked to be thrust into the midst of royal history by virtue of the man she happens to love.But, for those of us who remain loyal to the memory of Princess Diana, the Coronation on Saturday poses an unprecedented moral challenge.We know that until her dying breath, the then most famous woman in the world, now a forever icon, was vociferously opposed to the idea of Queen Camilla.",
        "Her close friends have revealed the mere mention of such a prospect filled her with equal levels of punch-in-the-guts dread, immense upset and visceral anger.\u2018I'd like to be a queen in people's hearts but I don't see myself being queen of this country,\u2019 she declared in the now discredited Martin Bashir Panorama interview.Indeed, she told former newspaper editor Sir Max Hastings around the same time that her entire focus was on the crown passing over Charles so that her young son William could succeed Queen Elizabeth II as monarch, no doubt in large part because of her understandable hatred of the other woman in her \u2018crowded\u2019 marriage.While Diana\u2019s broad base of tens of millions of ardent supporters may have softened over the past 25 years, with many accepting it is simply time to move on, new polling from Lord Ashcroft this week for the Daily Mail reveals I\u2019m not alone in feeling uneasy.His bombshell survey showed, days ahead of the Coronation, just 39 per cent of Brits have a favourable view of Camilla, making her the fourth least popular senior royal, behind only Harry, Meghan and Andrew.Despite the mainstream media long ago accepting Camilla, in large part due to her good personal relations with reporters and editors, the public remains stubbornly unconvinced.Which is why the decision by an uncompromising King to put his reluctant wife at the centre of his Coronation is very risky indeed.There\u2019s two ways to look at the scenario.",
        "Charles has been on a journey with us all, adapting his position as public opinion softened to the idea of Queen Camilla.Or we\u2019ve been hoodwinked.I haven\u2019t forgotten that Diana loyalists were pacified by the assurance when Charles and Camilla married in 2005 that she would only ever be known as Princess Consort.That formal position only changed last year when the dying late Queen publicly proclaimed: \u2018It is my sincere wish that, when that time comes, Camilla will be known as Queen Consort as she continues her own loyal service.\u2019Again, the addition of Consort to the title provided some reassurance, although I was one of the few royal commentators to admit publicly that I remained wary about the prospect in a column for MailOnline.After the death of the late Queen, the public wanted to support a grieving Charles, who helped reassure a shaken nation with a near pitch perfect performance in the days leading up to the state funeral (a tantrum over a pesky leaky fountain pen aside).",
        "That still wasn\u2019t enough for Charles, though, with the April revelation, confirmed by the official Coronation invite, that it was the intention of the King from this Saturday to refer to Camilla simply as the Queen.It does beg the question whether the late Queen believed Camilla would continue to be referred to as Queen Consort even after her son\u2019s Coronation. Maybe we will never know.But, in all honesty, I believe that this outcome has been Charles\u2019 desire and plan all along, especially given that formally referring to Camilla as Princess Consort would have required a law change.I\u2019m not angry or even disappointed about this ruse, but reluctantly accept it with a degree of necessary pragmatism.For the King to be successful in his role at his age, it\u2019s important he has a near equal in Camilla who can shoulder some of the burden.Over the past few months, I have tried to discover what Diana\u2019s friends think about the outcome.Long-time BBC royal editor Jennie Bond revealed recently that in an off the record conversation in 1995 Diana told her \u2018that she thought Camilla had been loyal and discreet and deserved some form of recognition\u2019, although that certainly didn\u2019t mean becoming Queen.Diana\u2019s rock and long-time loyalist Paul Burrell, her former butler, told me that his favourite person in the world would have, long ago, accepted Camilla, even if she would have never been able to refer to her as Queen.\u2018I think Diana was very gracious. By this stage in her life she would have found love and settled down. And I think she would have said, \u201cLet them get on with it.\u201d She didn\u2019t bear a grudge,\u2019 Paul explained.\u2018One day William will be King \u2013 Diana\u2019s son on the throne! We\u2019ve got to cross this bridge with Charles and Camilla; I\u2019m a monarchist, we have to. But on the other side is King William and Queen Catherine.\u2019So, while I\u2019ll admit it sticks in my craw for the moment at least, I will accept the King\u2019s wishes and, from this Saturday onwards, refer to his dutiful wife as Queen Camilla.That doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m any less loyal to the memory of Princess Diana, who I have no doubt would have carved out a formal role as one of the biggest forces for good in the world, and we all know would have been a transformational Queen if her marriage hadn\u2019t failed.Most of the Royal Family and British establishment might want to erase her memory, but luckily her son, the new Prince of Wales, will never allow that to happen.Like Di, I believe in the principle of our consistent and proud hereditary monarchy.While it might take longer than the People\u2019s Princess hoped, King William is only possible if Charles\u2019 reign is a success.For that to happen, the King has made it clear that Camilla as Queen is non-negotiable."
