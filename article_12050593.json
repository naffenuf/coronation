        "He told police he woke up about 5.30am as the man left, texting him words to the effect of 'are you OK', saying he was concerned for his welfare.'He rang me and sounded distraught. I said I couldn't understand you and he hung up,' he said.Police allege Mr Whittaker then sent the man several text messages saying: 'You just can't ring me and say that mate.",
        "'Sorry but what the f--k, there's no f--king way I was doing that dude.'Mr Whittaker responded that while the phone call was incomprehensible, he could tell the man was 'accusing me'.He further told police he had hired a defamation lawyer and sent a letter to Cricket Australia after rumours of sexual misconduct got him 'terminated' from later jobs at the International Cricket Council and Australia Post.'I can't help but feel it's vindictive and it's following me ...
