        "South Korea striker Son clearly noticed the spectator as he walked around the pitch perimeter close to the Palace fans after being substituted near the end of Saturday\u2019s game in north London.The incident was caught on camera, circulated on social media and reported to the clubs.A Palace statement read: \u2018Evidence has been shared with the police, and when he is identified, he will face a club ban. We will not tolerate such behaviour.\u2019Spurs said: \u2018We will do everything in our powers to ensure that if found guilty, the individual will receive the strongest possible action.\u2019",
        "The supporter had appeared to pull his eyes sideways, swear at Son, and appear to mock a tourist taking pictures with a camera.This marks the third time this season where Son has been targeted by racial abuse having encountered similar fallout after games against Chelsea and West Ham.A Chelsea supporter was given a stadium ban by the club and charged with a racially aggravated public order offence for making a racially aggravated gesture at Son.Meanwhile, Tottenham also had to carry out similar investigations after their player received racist messages on social media after a 2-0 win over West Ham in February.Kick It Out released a similar statement following the incident and questioned the current existing policy that makes players leave the pitch at the nearest exit.",
        "The organisations Head of Player Engagement Troy Townsend said: 'Kick It Out are appalled to hear that Heung-Min Son was subject to alleged racist abuse during yesterday's Premier League fixture between Tottenham Hotspur and Crystal Palace.'This is not the first time that he has been forced to endure such abhorrent discrimination. It is vital that player welfare is always the priority, and we urge football's stakeholders to examine whether their policy of making players leave the pitch at the nearest point can in certain circumstances risk exposing players to discriminatory abuse, particularly during moments of high tension in the game.'Furthermore, we commend the clubs and the Metropolitan Police for their swift response to this incident and echo Crystal Palace's stance that any perpetrators must receive a club ban for their actions.'Kick It Out are here to support all victims of discriminatory abuse and we would encourage anybody who sadly experiences or witnesses abuse of any kind in the game to report it to us.'"
