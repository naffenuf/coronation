        "Coronation Big Lunch attendees in south-east London believe they may have set the record for the \u201clargest human image of a crown\u201d after more than 500 people donned purple, yellow and white and joined in on coronation weekend.",
        "Those who attended the Big Lunch coronation tea party at Broomhill Common in Orpington on Sunday were invited to participate in the record attempt, with the template taking inspiration from the Wye Crown in Kent, carved into a hillside to celebrate the coronation of King Edward VII in 1902.Steve Sangster, 40, from Orpington, chairman of the Knoll Residents Association, told the PA news agency that the idea to go for the record came after the community produced a portrait image of Queen Elizabeth II using candles in 2022.\u201cThe idea of the record attempt came from the Queen\u2019s death in terms of the twinkling stars,\u201d he said.",
        "\u201cSomeone said \u2018Oh, it\u2019s probably some sort of world record, the largest image of the Queen\u2019, and that got us thinking maybe for our next event we\u2019ll do something along those lines.\u201cWe wanted to look forward to the coronation really with a different sort of vibe, we wanted it to be a celebration.\u201cThat idea of a community coming together to create a visual image, a temporary historical marker, if you like, was our vision for it.\u201d",
        "It took 45 minutes to produce the final image, with people encouraged to pause their picnics and join in by donning ponchos to fill out the crown.",
        "\u201cWe called people by colours, first of all, got into position, and then of course, people start getting out of shape, they\u2019re not filling out certain parts of it,\u201d said Mr Sangster.\u201cSo we\u2019re trying to communicate, we had a PA system, I was there with the drone thinking, \u2018OK, we need to fill this bit out, you know, we need more purples\u2019, trying to get people up off the picnics and the seating to come and get involved in it.\u201cBut yeah, it worked out in the end.\u201dMr Sangster said they will need to submit their evidence and wait a number of weeks before their record is confirmed, but he believes 539 people were counted.However, he also emphasised the importance of bringing people together, regardless of their passion for the royal family.\u201cWhether you\u2019re a royalist or not, it\u2019s an excuse to get the community together,\u201d he said.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t happen all that often sadly, and everyone on the day says \u2018Oh we\u2019ve got to do this twice a year\u2019 because there\u2019s so many new interactions, so many new friendships and connections and ideas that come out of these events.\u201cIt\u2019s such a boost to the local community.\u201d"
