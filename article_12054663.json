        "Claudia Winkleman and Jack Whitehall have joked about the King\u2019s coronation live on BBC Radio 2, with comedian Whitehall describing it as a \u201cTory Glastonbury\u201d.",
        "The pair were discussing how Jack\u2019s mother and father, Hilary and Michael Whitehall, were celebrating the historic service on Saturday morning when they made the quip.Asked how his 83-year-old TV producer father Michael was feeling about the big day, Jack said: \u201cObviously for him, he\u2019s very excited about this because the coronation is like Tory Glastonbury \u2013 it\u2019s a huge event.\u201d",
        "Winkleman, who presents a Saturday morning show on the station, jokingly agreed with the sentiment, adding that it was like a \u201cTory Christmas\u201d.Jack also revealed that his actress mother, who he described as a \u201croyal enthusiast\u201d, had been camped out for three days at The Mall outside Buckingham Palace ahead of the ceremony to secure herself a prime spot in the crowd.He said: \u201cMy news at 10 \u2013 coronation themed \u2013 is that my mum camped out on The Mall and is down there right now, she\u2019s been there for three days. She got there three days early on her own, obviously not with my dad.\u201cI mean, to be fair, I think that\u2019s what happens when you\u2019ve been married to my dad for over 30 years, you would rather have 72 hours in a tent in The Mall with a load of randoms rather than spending another second with Michael Whitehall.\u201d",
        "The stand-up added that she was \u201cfully prepared for everything\u201d including being loaded with pepper spray \u201cin case Holly and Phil tried to barge past her at the last minute\u201d.In September, This Morning hosts Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby faced a backlash after claims they skipped the queue for the late Queen\u2019s lying in state.Hilary and Michael Whitehall rose back to prominence in recent years after featuring alongside their son Jack in the Netflix series Travels With My Father.The BBC and representatives for Claudia Winkleman and Jack Whitehall have been contacted for comment."
