        "Sam Allardyce has urged Leeds to produce their best defensive display of the season in his first game in charge on Saturday at Manchester City.",
        "The former England boss, 68, has four games remaining to try and preserve Leeds\u2019 Premier League status after replacing Javi Gracia on Wednesday.Allardyce, who will be back in the dugout for the first time since leaving West Brom in 2021, said: \u201cDefensively the team will have to be the best it\u2019s been this season.\u201cObviously it\u2019s been a bit frail and we\u2019re going to try and put that right while we\u2019ve been here.\u201cIn possession I\u2019ve always seen them to be very, very good, so there\u2019s not a lot of work needs to be done from that point of view.\u201cBut out of possession recently, as everyone can see by the goals conceded, it\u2019s something that needs most work on in the short time we\u2019ve had.\u201d The sad thing for us is they\u2019re in the best form they\u2019ve been in all season  Sam Allardyce on Man City  Leeds sit above the relegation zone on goal difference and the former Bolton, Newcastle, West Ham, Sunderland and Everton boss said he was delighted with the players\u2019 reaction to his survival plan.\u201cI couldn\u2019t be more pleased,\u201d he said. \u201cThe players have aired their views and that\u2019s important for me.\u201cWe\u2019ve come together and put a plan together. We\u2019ve analysed the best way we can play on Saturday and listened to a lot of staff already here about players.",
        "\u201cWe\u2019ve formulated an idea and we\u2019ll tell them the starting XI later (on Friday) morning.\u201cThey\u2019ve got to do the talking on the pitch now. I can talk here as much as I want, but I want the players to go out and show we\u2019ve made a difference and that they\u2019re passionate enough to fight to the very end.\u201d",
        "Allardyce insists Pep Guardiola\u2019s City, who he rates alongside Manchester United\u2019s Treble-winners of 1999 as the best ever in the English top flight, are closing in on their fifth title in six seasons because of how they defend.\u201cWhy are Man City top of the league? Because they\u2019ve got the best defensive record,\u201d he said.\u201cCity, defensively, are the best at everything. The general public don\u2019t look at that, but that\u2019s why they\u2019re top now.\u201dAllardyce claimed earlier in the week that he was as good a manager as Guardiola, Jurgen Klopp and Mikel Arteta and in response the City boss agreed.Guardiola said the current generation of top managers had all learned off the likes of Allardyce, Roy Hodgson and Neil Warnock.\u201cWe\u2019ve always got on,\u201d Allardyce added. \u201cHe\u2019s a great guy and his knowledge is fantastic. It\u2019s great to be pitting your wits against him.\u201cHis management style over the years has been fabulous and the sad thing for us is they\u2019re in the best form they\u2019ve been in all season because they\u2019ve won nine on the trot.\u201d",
        "Allardyce, who will be without Tyler Adams, Luis Sinisterra and Liam Cooper at the Etihad Stadium, admitted he will be anxious ahead of kick-off.He will return to the dugout for the first time since being relegated from the top flight for the first time in his 30-year managerial career with last club West Brom at the end of the 2020-21 season.Allardyce added: \u201cThe nerves carry on until kick-off, then they disappear for me.\u201cAfter the game, who knows, I\u2019d like to be able to smile. That would be one magnificent result, if we get one.\u201d"
