        "Tim Cook has insisted 'tech wreck' will not be hitting his workforceThe Apple CEO said layoffs are 'not something we're talking about'\u00a0His remarks came as Apple posted surprisingly strong quarterly returnsApple CEO Tim Cook insisted his firm has no plans to fall victim to tech wreck layoffs 'at the moment', as other online giants slash thousands of workers.\u00a0",
        "Cook, 62, told CNBC culling his workforce would only be seen as a 'last resort', adding that it is 'not something we're talking about at this moment'.\u00a0His remarks came as the tech giant reported a huge $24 billion profit in the second financial quarter of the fiscal year, alongside $95 billion in total revenue.\u00a0Apple's resistance to carrying out mass layoffs stands in stark contrast to many of its rivals such as Google, Meta and Microsoft, who have each sacked thousands of employees since the start of the year.\u00a0",
        "While calming fears that Apple could fall alongside its competitors, Cook maintained that Apple is still cutting costs and slowing hiring rates amid an economic downturn.\u00a0'We're continuing to be extremely prudent in hiring,' the CEO said.\u00a0We're continuing to hire, just at a lower clip level than we were before.\u00a0'And we're doing all the right things of challenging the things that we spend, and we're just finding a few more ways to save on it.'\u00a0While many competitors, such as Meta, aggressively hired new employees during the tech industry's pandemic boost, Apple was slower in adding to its workforce.\u00a0Although its slimmed down staff numbers may be one of the reasons for a lack of sackings, the company's profitability has also been impressive.\u00a0",
        "Apple celebrated better-than-expected quarterly returns during its March quarter earning report on Thursday, boosted by $24 billion in profits.",
        "Despite weak expectations from Wall Street and a slumping economic outlook, the company saw a surprising spike in iPhone sales.\u00a0Speaking after the returns were released, Cook admitted to CNBC the quarter was 'better than we expected'.\u00a0'We were thrilled by our performance in emerging markets,' he continued to Reuters. 'We set records for the iPhone installed base in every geographic segment, and we had very strong 'new to' (sales in) emerging markets, particularly in Brazil, India and Mexico.'Apple said sales for its fiscal second quarter ended April 1 fell 2.5 percent to $94.84 billion, better than analyst expectations of a 4.4 percent decline to $93 billion, according to data from Refinitiv.Profit was flat at $1.52 per share, compared with estimates of a 5.7 percent fall to $1.43 per share, according to Refinitiv data.",
        "Cook's remarks come as several of his rival CEO's have made the decision to sack large numbers of their staff to save their bottom lines.\u00a0Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg released around 13 percent of his company in November, and is preparing to let go of another 10,000 employees in a second round of job cuts.\u00a0Other major rivals to urgently introduce cost-cutting measures include Microsoft and Amazon, with both brands announcing plans to cut 10,000 and 18,000 staff respectively.\u00a0",
        "A slew of tech companies have announced cost-cutting measures, with Amazon, Apple and Google-parent Alphabet all announcing hiring slowdowns or freezes.For the sector, the pandemic boom turned to a post-pandemic bust, as rising interest rates batter share prices and inflation cuts into profits.A\u00a0'tech wreck' has been sweeping Silicon Valley this year with almost 200,00 jobs paying a combined $12 billion annually wiped out so far.\u00a0This has already surpassed the 165,000 jobs cut for the whole of 2022, according to analysis from Layoffs.fyi, which tracks firings in real time through information gleaned in media and company releases.Meta In March, the company announced it would deliver another roughly 10,000 job cuts in the coming months and cease recruiting for the 5,000 positions it had been trying to fill.The Facebook-parent said in November it would cut 13 percent of its workforce, or more than 11,000 employees, in one of the biggest tech layoffs this year as it grapples with a weak advertising market and mounting costs.It cut 4,000 roles in its tech department in April in a second round of layoffs with a third round of cuts announced in May.\u00a0",
        "Like its peers, Meta aggressively hired during the pandemic to meet a surge in social media usage by stuck-at-home consumers.\u00a0But but the pandemic boom-times petered out as advertisers and consumers pull the plug on spending in the face of soaring costs and rapidly rising interest rates.After plunging billions into CEO Mark Zuckerberg's Metaverse vision with little to show for it, Meta has been faced with rising costs and shrinking profits.Meta, once worth more than $1 trillion, lost around 70 percent of its value last year alone. Stocks have bounced back in 2023 but remained below their peak at the beginning on March.'Not only has online commerce returned to prior trends, but the macroeconomic downturn, increased competition, and ads signal loss have caused our revenue to be much lower than I'd expected,' Zuckerberg said in a message to employees.'I got this wrong, and I take responsibility for that.'",
        "On a short call, a red-eyed Zuckerberg addressed employees but took no questions.\u00a0He stuck to a script that closely followed the wording in the morning's blogpost and called the increased investments in e-commerce a 'big mistake in planning.'TwitterTwitter laid off half its workforce across teams ranging from communications and content curation to product and engineering following Elon Musk's $44 billion takeover.The cutbacks affected roughly 3,700 employees, who learned their fate by email last year.\u00a0Its massive job cuts continued in February with another 200 jobs culled, taking its staff count to under 2,000.\u00a0\u00a0",
        "SalesforceIn January,\u00a0cloud-based software company Salesforce announced it will layoff 10 percent of its employees or about 8,000 workers.CEO Marc Benioff cited a rough period for the tech sector as well as over-hiring during COVID-19 leading to the decision.\u00a0'Our sales performance process drives accountability. Unfortunately, that can lead to some leaving the business, and we support them through their transition,' a Salesforce spokesperson said.Salesforce had 73,541 employees at the beginning of last year - it is the largest employer in the San Francisco area.\u00a0The company said in an August filing that headcount rose 36 percent in the past year 'to meet the higher demand for services from our customers.'\u00a0AmazonAmazon said it would layoff 18,000 corporate and technology jobs what will be the largest job cuts in the company's history.The move comes as the company reportedly lost $1trillion over the year after its stock plummeted from a high during the pandemic.\u00a0And CEO Andy Jassy told staff in March another 9,000 jobs would be cut.\u00a0",
        "The move comes after the company put a hiring freeze in place, affecting major teams\u00a0including Prime Video, Alexa and Amazon Fresh.'We're facing an unusual macroeconomic environment, and want to balance our hiring and investments with being thoughtful about this economy,' Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, wrote in a memo.IntelIntel Corp's CEO Pat Gelsinger told Reuters 'people actions' would be part of a cost-reduction plan.\u00a0The chipmaker said recently it would reduce costs by $3 billion in 2023,\u00a0then ramping that up to $10 billion by 2025.The adjustments would start in the fourth quarter, Gelsinger said, but did not specify how many employees would be affected.Some Intel divisions, including the sales and marketing group, could be cut by up to 20 percent, Bloomberg News\u00a0reported, citing people with knowledge of the situation.Intel confirmed layoffs would take place across the company in May but declined to reveal how many employees would be affected.",
        "The company had 113,700 employees as of July, when it slashed its annual sales forecast by $11 billion after missing estimates for second-quarter results.Intel, based in Santa Clara, California declined to comment on the job cuts when reached by DailyMail.com in October.\u00a0Intel has been battered by shifting market trends, including the decline of traditional personal computers as smartphones and tablets rise in popularity.Last quarter, global PC shipments, including desktops and laptops, declined another 15 percent from a year ago, according to IDC.\u00a0MicrosoftMicrosoft in January initiated layoffs of 10,000 employees, citing slowing customer demand and a negative economic environment.'We're also seeing organizations in every industry and geography exercise caution as some parts of the world are in a recession and other parts are anticipating one,' CEO Satya Nadella said in a company memo.The layoffs affected nearly 5 percent of Microsoft's global workforce.\u00a0It announced 158 more job cuts in May in addition to the 10,000 announced in January.\u00a0Microsoft previously laid off under 1,000 employees across several divisions last year, according to Axios.In a statement, Microsoft executives said: 'Like all companies, we evaluate our business priorities on a regular basis, and make structural adjustments accordingly.",
        "'We will continue to invest in our business and hire in key growth areas in the year ahead.'Microsoft executives previously announced in July that it was laying off less than 1 percent of its workforce and significantly slow hiring, as its revenue fell short of investor expectations.The company recorded only $51.9 billion in revenue during the second quarter of the year, but was expected to rake in $52.4 billion.It had previously recorded blockbuster growth during the COVID pandemic, when consumers and businesses turned to its products as they shifted to a work-from-home model.LyftRide-hailing firm Lyft said it would lay off 26 percent of its workforce, or about 1,072 employees, after it already cut 60 jobs and froze hiring in September.Lyft said in a regulatory filing it would likely incur $41 million to $47 million in restructuring charges related to the layoffs.\u00a0'We are not immune to the realities of inflation and a slowing economy,' Lyft's founders wrote in the memo to staffers.\u00a0",
        "The company's share price has fallen 76 percent since the beginning of last year and was $7.96 on May 24, compared to nearly $45 in January 2022.Lyft has about 4,000 employees, not including its drivers.SpotifyThe music streaming service said on January 22 it plans to cut 6% of its workforce, an estimated 588 employees from its 9,800 full time staff.\u00a0Spotify said it will incur about $38million in severance-related charges.The company, whose CEO is Daniel Ek, said its chief content and advertising business officer Dawn Ostroff will also depart.",
        "Apple\u00a0Though Apple has not yet announced any major layoffs, CEO\u00a0Tim Cook told CBS Mornings\u00a0that it is slowing some hiring as well.'What we're doing as a consequence of being in this period, is we're being very deliberate in our hiring,' he said. 'That means we're continuing to hire, but not everywhere in the company are we hiring.'At the same time, though, Cook said 'we don't believe you can save your way to prosperity.\"'We think you invest your way to it,' he said."
