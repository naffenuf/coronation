        "BRASILIA, May 3 (Reuters) - Brazil's former President Jair Bolsonaro said on Wednesday he was 'surprised' by a police raid at his home as part of an investigation into falsified COVID-19 vaccination records, reaffirming he has not been jabbed.",
        "\"For my part, there was nothing falsified. I didn't take the vaccine. Period,\" the ex far-right leader, a strident coronavirus skeptic, told reporters outside his home after the raid. He added police have seized his cellphone. (Reporting by Anthony Boadle; Writing by Gabriel Araujo; Editing by Steven Grattan)"
