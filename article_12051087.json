        "An animal welfare organisation has lost a High Court challenge over allegations the Government \u201csecretly\u201d abandoned a historic ban on testing cosmetic product ingredients on animals.",
        "Cruelty Free International (CFI) brought legal action against the Home Office, accusing it of leaving the public \u201cin blissful ignorance\u201d that the department\u2019s long-standing policy apparently changed after February 2019.It claimed ministers were \u201cwilling to grant licences for animal testing of cosmetic ingredients\u201d and the \u201cweakening\u201d of a policy ban first announced in 1998 \u201ccannot be lawful\u201d.The Home Office, which oversees animal experimentation regulation in Great Britain, rejected the CFI\u2019s case as \u201cplainly wrong\u201d, arguing it had not acted unlawfully.In a ruling on Friday, Mr Justice Linden dismissed the organisation\u2019s challenge, finding in its favour over the interaction of different EU laws retained after Brexit. It is a case where a policy based on political and ethical considerations, which accorded with the views of the claimant and others, was in place for a number of years. Like all such policies, there could be no substantial grounds to expect that the policy would continue  Mr Justice Linden  The judge said it is \u201cregrettable\u201d the Government did not publicly announce a change in policy and accepted it is a \u201cmatter of concern\u201d that \u201cinaccurate\u201d operational guidance was available on the internet.",
        "But he said overall there were no breaches of legal duties by the Home Office and neither the CFI nor the public had a \u201clegitimate expectation\u201d to be informed about a change in policy position.",
        "Much of the legal dispute centred on the CFI\u2019s claim the Home Office had an \u201cerroneous legal understanding\u201d of EU legislation relating to cosmetics and their safety.Mr Justice Linden said cosmetics regulations, which aim to protect the safety of consumers, bans the testing of cosmetics and ingredients for cosmetics on animals.The marketing of products or ingredients tested on animals is also banned, the judge added in his ruling, which followed a two-day hearing in January.But separate\u00a0rules covering the evaluation of chemicals, including some used in cosmetics, is \u201cmore permissive\u201d and is concerned with the safety of substances from a broader human and environmental contexts, the judge said. No assurances were given to the claimant that it would continue for any particular length of time, nor that the claimant or anyone else would be consulted in respect of any proposed changes  Mr Justice Linden  These allow for the testing of substances on animals but only as a \u201clast resort\u201d and to meet the requirements of the regulations, such as the need to assess risks to manufacturing workers.The Home Office\u2019s policy is that animal testing is lawful in the UK and not in conflict with bans in \u201climited circumstances\u201d when there were \u201cno other alternative ways\u201d to meet the requirements of the chemical-related regulations, the court was told.",
        "Mr Justice Linden concluded the Government had modified its policy for \u201cpragmatic reasons\u201d rather than any legal requirement \u2013 but said it was \u201cperfectly coherent to take the view that the two legislative regimes can be read compatibly with each other\u201d.The judge said the Government accepted its change in position \u201cwas not fully documented or widely communicated at the time\u201d.It is \u201cplausible\u201d the Home Office did not publicise the change because it would be \u201cpolitically unpopular\u201d to be potentially seen to be \u201cwatering\u201d the legislation \u201cdown\u201d.But the judge said there was no breach of a public law duty to notify CFI or the public, saying it had been \u201cneither unfair nor irrational\u201d to hold meetings with licence holders without consulting CFI.\u201cI do not see anything in the evidence, whether \u2018concrete\u2019 or otherwise, which gave rise to a legitimate expectation of consultation about any change in the policy,\u201d the judge said.\u201cIt is a case where a policy based on political and ethical considerations, which accorded with the views of the claimant (CFI) and others, was in place for a number of years.\u201cLike all such policies, there could be no substantial grounds to expect that the policy would continue.\u201dHe concluded: \u201cNo assurances were given to the claimant that it would continue for any particular length of time, nor that the claimant or anyone else would be consulted in respect of any proposed changes.\u201d",
        "CFI chief executive Michelle Thew said after the ruling that documents in the case showed the Home Office was \u201cprioritising the interests of contract-testing companies over those of animals and the wishes of the vast majority of British people who are strongly opposed to cosmetics testing\u201d.\u201cIt is outrageous that the Government has abandoned the ban on using animals in cosmetics testing, and did so in secret while giving the impression that the policy remained in place,\u201d she said.CFI said it would seek to appeal against the judgment.A Home Office spokesman said: \u201cIt remains unlawful to test cosmetic products, or their ingredients, on animals to meet the regulations required to place them on the market.\u201cThe marketing of cosmetic products or ingredients tested on animals is also banned.\u201d"
