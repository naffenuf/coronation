        "Manager Lee Johnson praised Hibernian for holding their nerve to see out a crucial 2-1 victory over St Mirren after admitting their \u201cdominant\u201d first-half performance \u201cfizzled out\u201d after the break.",
        "Goals from on-loan duo Elie Youan and Will Fish gave the Hibees a deserved 2-0 lead at the interval before St Mirren threatened to claim a point in the closing stages after Alex Greive pulled one back.\u201cI thought we made hard work of it in the second half, we should have had more control than we did,\u201d said Johnson, whose fifth-placed side closed to within a point of city rivals Hearts in the battle for European places. \u201cWe didn\u2019t dominate the midfield at all and in the first half we were very dominant.\u201cA lot of the stuff we worked on through the week was executed to perfection (in the first half). I thought the ball speed and our passing and movement was good and we had good opportunities in the first half.\u201cIn the second half, for whatever reason, we just fizzled out. Not enough were on their game but we continued to work hard.\u201cWe shuffled the pack and changed the shape to cope with a St Mirren side who were throwing caution to the wind after the poor goal we conceded and in the end it was good to see it out. Even in injury time I think we managed it quite well.",
        "\u201cOverall it\u2019s a great win for us, it\u2019s an important win because of that fifth place but also we\u2019re now chasing down everybody ahead of us.\u201d",
        "Hibs lost Jake Doyle-Hayes to a head knock in the first half and Johnson admitted the midfielder will need to be assessed.\u201cHopefully he\u2019s OK,\u201d said the manager. \u201cHe had quite a nasty bump on the side of his head.\u201cI just hope it\u2019s not concussion, firstly for him but also for us because he\u2019s an important player. I thought he was outstanding until he went off.\u201dSt Mirren manager Stephen Robinson lamented the two goals his side lost.\u201cIt was a disappointing start,\u201d he said. \u201cWe gave ourselves a mountain to climb, two individual errors have cost us.\u201cI\u2019ll take my share of the responsibility. I want us to keep the ball from throw-ins, I don\u2019t want us to just chuck it down the line, I want us to try and switch play. We got caught on it today.\u201cThe second is a set-play where we let a runner go. They are goals we don\u2019t usually concede which is frustrating.\u201cOur response to that was terrific. I asked them to go out and be brave and step forward and we should have taken something out of the game.\u201d"
