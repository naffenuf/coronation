        "It is ludicrous to say Ukraine\u2019s Nato membership is provocative to Russia and the UK Government should support an application from Kyiv, former prime minister Boris Johnson has said.",
        "He told MPs the next meeting of Nato heads in Vilnius, Lithuania, in July will be an \u201cimportant test\u201d of the military alliance\u2019s willingness to \u201cfulfil its long-standing promises to Ukraine\u201d.He said Kyiv should be invited to make the \u201cnecessary preparations\u201d to join \u201cas soon as possible\u201d for the sake of \u201cclarity\u201d and \u201cpeace\u201d in Europe.Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said Nato\u2019s position in regard to Ukraine is \u201cunambiguous\u201d and the invitation has been put out for Ukraine to join.Mr Johnson\u2019s comments came during questions to the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) in the Commons. This summer\u2019s Vilnius summit will be an important test of Nato\u2019s willingness to fulfil its long-standing promises to Ukraine  Boris Johnson  He said: \u201cThis summer\u2019s Vilnius summit will be an important test of Nato\u2019s willingness to fulfil its long-standing promises to Ukraine.",
        "\u201cDoes he agree with me that it\u2019s now ludicrous to say that Ukraine\u2019s Nato membership might be in some way provocative to Russia, since (Russian President Vladimir) Putin has shown what he is willing to do when Ukraine is not a member of Nato and because Ukraine is not a member of Nato?\u201cAnd does he agree that it should therefore be the policy of the Government that Ukraine should be invited to make the necessary preparations to join as soon as possible under the rules, for the sake of clarity and stability and peace in Europe?\u201d",
        "Mr Cleverly paid tribute to the former PM for \u201cthe leadership that he showed at a vital point in time\u201d, adding: \u201cNato\u2019s position in regard to Ukraine is unambiguous. The invitation has been put out for Ukraine to join Nato.\u201cI think it\u2019s incredibly important that that is not taken off the table.\u201cOf course Russia\u2019s aggression into Ukraine was the provocative action.\u201cUkraine\u2019s desire to join Nato was an entirely understandable defensive posture because of that threat from the east.\u201d"
