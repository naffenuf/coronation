        "Dressed in a \u00a3299 Ralph Lauren pink cable knit jumper, jean shorts and \u00a320 trainers, Charlotte wore a yellow-and-purple Scouts tie around her neck.Kate and William's second child looked like a pro as she operated the bow and eyed up her target ahead of time.Charlotte appeared to channel all her strength into the task at hand and frowned slightly as she let go of the bow.\u00a0Having clearly inherited her mother's sporting talents, Charlotte managed to get an instant bullseye on her first try - blowing her brothers out of the park.\u00a0After shovelling sand\u00a0and getting behind the wheel of a\u00a0JCB, Prince Louis attempted to shoot the bow and arrow.Determined not to accept any help, Prince Louis ran back and forth several times to pick up his arrows and hit the target on multiple occasions.\u00a0",

Although the Princess did have the slight advantage of having taken an archery lesson during a 2016 royal visit to Bhutan.\u00a0While the Princess of Wales was all smiles as she listened to her instructor, Prince William appeared to take the task incredibly seriously and looked incredibly focus as he drew his bow.What's more, Kate was seen pushing a wheelbarrow while her youngest son shoveled in sand as they helped spruce up a Slough scout hut.\u00a0",
        "He then took control, steering it expertly as his mum supported its weight.Charlotte was seen delightedly running to help prepare a new path while George, a future king himself, was spotted learning how to use a power drill.\u00a0The couple and their three children were out and about again to mark the third day of the King\u2019s Coronation, and Charles III's life of service.",
