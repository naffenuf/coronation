Paulo reported.The report added that under the proposal ADNOC would control Braskem, and it intends to pay a 135% premium over the share price, which would result in a deal price of 47.00 reais per share.Braskem's controlling shareholder, Novonor, said it had not received any proposal, according to a securities filing from Braskem.
