        "Former Sex Pistols bassist Glen Matlock appears to be struggling to rework the lyrics for God Save The Queen ahead of performing a new version on the day of the coronation.",
        "The singer-songwriter will be at the 100 Club in London on Saturday where he will perform God Save The King.Matlock told the PA news agency: \u201cWhen you start changing one word, you\u2019ve got to change them all.\u201cThere\u2019s not that many words that kind of rhyme nicely (with king) apart from bling, ming, it\u2019s not great.",
        "\u201cI\u2019ll probably just sort of make it up as I go along, so if you want to find out what the new lyrics might be, you better come on down because it\u2019ll probably be on the spur of the moment.\u201dMatlock, whose performance is listed on London City Hall\u2019s programme of royal festivities in the capital this weekend, said he is \u201cpassionately ambivalent\u201d about the monarchy.Sex Pistols released their anti-authoritarian hit in 1977 to mark the silver jubilee of the late Queen, and it was banned by the BBC.The song surged to number two in the UK singles chart despite being the only track in history to be listed with a blank title to avoid offence.The band promoted the record on their own jubilee boat trip along the Thames, which ended in their arrest, and it was re-released last year to mark the Queen\u2019s Platinum Jubilee.Matlock said he will not watch the King and Queen Consort being crowned at Westminster Abbey as he will be \u201cdeciding what shirt to wear\u201d and doing a sound check on Saturday.",
        "Asked what he thinks of the coronation\u2019s pomp and ceremony, Matlock said: \u201cThere\u2019s just so many people in destitution at the moment in this country. I think things are bleak for a lot of people and I think the royal family... they're kind of the opium of the masses, just keeping people quiet  Glen Matlock  \u201cI think it\u2019s kind of rubbing their noses in it a little bit. It\u2019s all a distraction but that\u2019s the country we live in.\u201cYeah, two sides of the coin, and I\u2019m sort of somewhere floating between the middle. I will not go down The Mall.\u201cI think things are bleak for a lot of people and I think the royal family is, like, kind of pretty much the same as Love Island or (The) X Factor. They\u2019re kind of the opium of the masses, just keeping people quiet, I think.\u201cThis is England and that\u2019s the way it is, what can I do about it? I just can rail against it every now and then.\u201dMatlock has been touring as new wave band Blondie\u2019s bassist and released his latest album Consequences Coming in April.He said: \u201c(Blondie) have a great body of work, they\u2019re interesting.\u201cChris Stein \u2013 who isn\u2019t touring any more, but was one of the founding members \u2013 he doesn\u2019t describe them as a pop group, he calls them an art project, and I can see what he means.",
        "\u201cThey\u2019ve always kind of pushed the envelope for their particular idiom.\u201d"
