        "Southampton boss Ruben Selles does not know what the future holds after a 4-3 defeat at Nottingham Forest left them on the brink of Premier League relegation.",
        "Saints were on the wrong side of a seven-goal thriller at the City Ground and they will lose their top-tier status at the weekend if they fail to beat Fulham or results go against them elsewhere.In contrast, Forest climbed out of the bottom three with a vital win which came courtesy of Taiwo Awoniyi\u2019s brace, Morgan Gibbs-White\u2019s penalty and Danilo\u2019s brilliant team goal to give realistic hope that they can avoid the drop in their first season back in the top tier for 23 years.",
        "Carlos Alcaraz, Lyanco and James Ward-Prowse goals ensured the Saints were always in the game, but they are now staring the drop to the Championship in the face.Selles, who took over from Nathan Jones on a deal until the end of the season, would like to stay at the club, but says that is not for him to decide.\u201cI try to do my best and as I said before I expected to win more football matches,\u201d he said.\u201cIt\u2019s a decision that the club needs to make. I would be happy to be here for the next 10 years as I have said many times. It's a decision that the club needs to make. I would be happy to be here for the next 10 years as I have said many times  Ruben Selles  ",
        "\u201cBut it is not for me to make that decision. I can only work every day and of course, in the situation we are in right now, it\u2019s so much uncertainty for everybody.\u201cWe just need to handle it in the best way possible, whatever happens, and then continue facing forward whatever it is.\u201cAnd if it is facing forward \u2013 if it\u2019s together then it\u2019s better.\u201cThe club will present an agenda for the coming days or weeks on how it is going to deal with that if it happens. That is for the club to respond.\u201cI can tell you what we are going to do for the next weeks, we are going to just keep working as much as we can and keep the situations for the future for the people that need to be responsible for that.\u201dForest took full advantage of defeats for Leeds and Leicester to move up to 16th, three points above the drop zone with three games to play.Boss Steve Cooper says the fight against the drop is not over, but that this could be a huge moment.\u201cWe feel like we are playing OK and we have won two games in three,\u201d he said. \u201cYou always want consecutive wins and where we are that is not easy to do, so to win two in three is a real positive thing.",
        "\u201cIt just gives us a little bit more confidence and momentum to just go into the next one. For sure we are going to need more points and more positive results.",
        "\u201cIt is a massive win tonight and an important one, but it will be even bigger if we build on it.\u201cThat has to be the plan from now. We will start the cycle of putting one game to bed and preparing for the next one.\u201cNo days off and the work ethic has to be at its maximum in giving the players everything they need to be ready for the next game.\u201d"
