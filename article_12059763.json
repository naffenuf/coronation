        "Diners at a local lunch club in Hertfordshire have said they feel \u201creally fortunate\u201d after a surprise visit by the Prime Minister as part of the Big Help Out.",
        "Local residents, most of them elderly, were served lamb casserole and wine by \u201cvery special guests\u201d Rishi Sunak and his wife, Akshata Murty, in the dining room of Mill End Community Centre in Rickmansworth.The Royal Voluntary Service (RVS) runs a lunch club at the centre from Monday to Friday, predominantly for people in the community who are removed from family networks.",
        "Mr Sunak and Ms Murty chopped parsnips and strawberries in the kitchen in black aprons before joining the room in a toast which ended in the group saying \u201clong live the King\u201d and giving three cheers.Across the country people have been encouraged to devote some free time on the Monday of the coronation bank holiday weekend for the Big Help Out, aimed at showcasing volunteering.Diners, who had not been warned about their prestigious helpers, chatted and took selfies with the Prime Minister surrounded by Union flag tablecloths, napkins and helium balloons, and rows of golden paper crowns.Mr Sunak could be heard telling people about a \u201cbig street party\u201d he attended yesterday in Downing Street to celebrate the coronation.He chatted with volunteers about how many courses the club usually serves and whether there were any \u201cparticular favourites\u201d on the menu.One diner, Val Leach, a former teacher from Rickmansworth, told the PA news agency: \u201cI told him I had been a young Conservative when I was 16 but over the years I lost my way as the party lost its way, but I\u2019m back now.\u201d",
        "With a miniature crown around her neck, the 77-year-old added that she was the proud owner of a bottle of whiskey signed by Margaret Thatcher and David Cameron.Another regular, 89-year-old Peter Worthington, called the Prime Minister \u201cbrilliant\u201d.\u201cWhat a relaxed person,\u201d the former vet said. \u201cHe was just like one of the crowd.\u201d\u201cIt was a lovely surprise. What you see is what you get. They are natural.\u201cThey don\u2019t appear to be career politicians \u2013 so refreshing.\u201cWe\u2019ve been really fortunate.\u201dPauline Warren, who has a brain injury and struggles to cook for herself, said she made Mr Sunak laugh.She told PA: \u201cHe brought my lunch and put it down in front of me. I said I always vote for people who feed me and he thought that was quite funny.\u201d",
        "Catherine Johnstone, chief executive of RVS and co-creator of the Big Help Out campaign, told PA that the charity runs hundreds of lunch clubs for people in various local communities \u2013 catering for the elderly, people with learning disabilities and those with long-term health conditions.Asked about the Prime Minister\u2019s visit, she said: \u201cIt was brilliant, absolutely amazing that they took the time to come in.\u201cWhat was really impressive was that they just wanted to help out.",
        "\u201cThey came in, they donned their pinnies, they helped prepare the lunch, served the lunch and then they spent a lot of time with a lot of care talking to the clients that came here.\u201d"
