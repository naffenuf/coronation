Not too many MCU films manage to carve themselves a little niche where you care about whatever tiny pocket of the universe they inhabit, but here you ride with gang.'Also we have known them so long now we get to see arcs!'Someone else wrote: 'The guardians of the galaxy movie is superb' while a separate person added: 'Guardians of the Galaxy vol 3 is pretty good.

        "Fans have given the latest film in the Guardians Of The Galaxy franchise rave reviews but with\u00a0an 80 per cent critics score on Rotten Tomatoes, it's\u00a0far behind the 92% score for 2014's Guardians of the Galaxy and the 85% for 2017's Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.DailyMail.comRating:Brian Viner\u00a0gave the superhero sequel four stars out of five, declaring it 'marvellously bonkers.'He praised the soundtrack and said: 'Needless to add, it\u2019s not meant to be taken remotely seriously, although at times it tries a little too hard to be funny. Come to think of it, the forced humour of all three Guardians films could make another academic thesis.'VarietyPeter DeBurge noted that director James Gunn, 'keeps the surprises coming, so audiences are actively engaged throughout, trying to manage multiple storylines and the ever-changing loyalties between characters.'The Hollywood Reporter\u00a0Frank Scheck also offered a positive review of Guardians 3, though he admitted Gunn's writing left something to be desired.'Gunn\u00a0doesn\u2019t fully succeed in tying all these threads together into a coherent whole. And the storyline is too complicated by far, with so many things going on at so many different times and places that multiple viewings are practically necessary to keep it all straight (not that Disney has a problem with that),' Scheck said.Wall Street Journal\u00a0Critic Kyle Smith called the sequel a, 'blahbuster'He adds the sequel, 'jogs along from one visually extravagant, strenuously jokey set piece to another without offering much in the way of either dramatic engagement or actually funny ideas.'",
        "One of the many negative reviews from critics was from Wall Street Journal critic Kyle Smith, who called the sequel a, 'blahbuster.'He adds the sequel, 'jogs along from one visually extravagant, strenuously jokey set piece to another without offering much in the way of either dramatic engagement or actually funny ideas.'Vanity Fair critic Richard Lawson called the sequel an, 'odd, lumbering patchwork of a film, occasionally fascinating but otherwise bloated and aimless.'Johnny Oleksinski from the New York Post added, 'The misfit team\u2019s constant punchlines and I\u2019m-just-busting-your-chops dynamic have grown exhausting. They\u2019ve become the guy at the party who thinks he\u2019s hilarious but is actually just drunk.'"
