        "Elon Musk threatened to reassign National Public Radio\u2019s Twitter account to \u201canother company\u201d, according to the non-profit news organisation, in a continuing dispute between Mr Musk and media groups since his 44 billion dollar acquisition of the social network last year.",
        "\u201cSo is NPR going to start posting on Twitter again, or should we reassign @NPR to another company?\u201d he wrote in one email late on Tuesday to NPR tech reporter Bobby Allyn.NPR stopped tweeting from its main account after Twitter abruptly labelled the group\u2019s main account as \u201cstate-affiliated media\u201d last month, a term that has also been used to identify outlets controlled or heavily influenced by authoritarian governments.Twitter then changed the label to \u201cgovernment-funded media\u201d.NPR said both labels were inaccurate and undermined its credibility \u2014 noting that it operates independently of the US government. Federal funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting accounts for less than 1% of NPR\u2019s annual operating budget, the company said.The last tweets on NPR\u2019s main account are from April 12 when it shared a thread of other places readers and listeners could find its journalism.",
        "Twitter temporarily labelled other news organisations \u2014 including the BBC and PBS \u2014 as \u201cgovernment-funded media\u201d. PBS also stopped using its Twitter account in response.An article written by Allyn late on Tuesday detailed the messages the billionaire owner of Twitter sent regarding NPR\u2019s account. Mr Musk pointed to NPR\u2019s choice to stop tweeting as the reasoning behind possibly reassigning the account.\u201cOur policy is to recycle handles that are definitively dormant,\u201d he wrote in one email. \u201cSame policy applies to all accounts. No special treatment for NPR.\u201d",
        "According to Twitter\u2019s online policy, the platform determines an account\u2019s inactivity based on logging on \u2014 not tweeting. Twitter says users should log in at least every 30 days to keep their accounts active, and \u201caccounts may be permanently removed due to prolonged inactivity\u201d.Mr Musk\u2019s comments and his actions do not always match and it is uncertain if he will reassign NPR\u2019s handle, regardless of Twitter\u2019s published policy on account activity.Asked by NPR who would be willing to use its Twitter account, Mr Musk replied, \u201cNational Pumpkin Radio\u201d, along with a fire emoji and a laughing emoji, NPR reported. Hard to imagine a more potent example of Musk\u2019s willingness to use Twitter to arbitrarily intimidate and retaliate against any person or organisation that irks him  Liz Woolery  It is unknown if NPR has logged into its account, which currently has a blue tick without the previous \u201cgovernment-funded media\u201d label, since April.Mr Musk disbanded Twitter\u2019s media and public relations department after the takeover.It is the latest volley in what many experts describe as a chilling and uncertain landscape for journalism on Twitter since he acquired the company in October.In addition to removing news organisations\u2019 verifications and temporarily adding labels like \u201cgovernment-funded media\u201d on some accounts, he abruptly suspended the accounts of individual journalists who wrote about Twitter late last year.",
        "Liz Woolery, digital policy lead at literary organisation PEN America, said it is \u201chard to imagine a more potent example of Musk\u2019s willingness to use Twitter to arbitrarily intimidate and retaliate against any person or organisation that irks him, with or without provocation\u201d.\u201cIt\u2019s a purely authoritarian tactic, seemingly intended to undermine one of the country\u2019s premier and most trusted news organisations \u2014 one that is especially important to rural communities across the US,\u201d she added."
