        "The head of the United Nations\u2019 nuclear watchdog has expressed growing concern about the safety of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, after the governor of the Russia-occupied area ordered the evacuation of a town where most of the plant\u2019s staff live amid ongoing attacks in the area.",
        "The plant is near the front lines of fighting, and Ukrainian authorities said on Sunday that a 72-year-old woman was killed and three other people injured when Russian forces fired more than 30 shells at Nikopol, a Ukrainian-held town close to the plant.\u201cThe general situation in the area near the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant is becoming increasingly unpredictable and potentially dangerous,\u201d International Atomic Energy Agency head Rafael Grossi said in a warning on Saturday, before the latest report of attacks.\u201cI\u2019m extremely concerned about the very real nuclear safety and security risks facing the plant.\u201dMr Grossi\u2019s comments were prompted by an announcement on Friday by Yevgeny Balitsky, the Russian-installed governor of the partially-occupied Zaporizhzhia province, that he had ordered the evacuation of civilians from 18 settlements in the area, including Enerhodar, which is located next to the power plant, which is Europe\u2019s largest.The settlements affected are 30-40 miles (50-70km) from the front line of fighting between Ukraine and Russia, and Mr Balitsky said Ukraine has intensified attacks on the area in the past several days.The region is also widely seen as a likely focus for Ukraine\u2019s anticipated spring counter-offensive.Some of the fiercest ongoing fighting is in the eastern city of Bakhmut, where Ukrainian forces are still clinging to a position on the western outskirts despite Russia trying to take the city for more than nine months.",
        "Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said on Sunday that Moscow\u2019s forces had captured two more districts in the city\u2019s west and north-west, but provided no further details.Ukraine\u2019s Special Operations Forces on Saturday accused Russia of using phosphorous in the city and on Sunday released a new video showing the tell-tale white fire from such munitions.International law prohibits the use of white phosphorus or other incendiary weapons \u2013 munitions designed to set fire to objects or cause burn injuries \u2013 in areas where there could be concentrations of civilians, though it can also be used for illumination or to create smoke screens.It was not possible to independently verify where the video was shot or when, but chemical weapons expert Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, a former British army colonel, said it was clearly white phosphorous.\u201cThis is being fired directly at Ukraine positions and this would be a war crime,\u201d he said.\u201cI expect because the Russians have failed to take Bakhmut conventionally, they are now using unconventional tactics to burn the Ukrainian soldiers to death or to get them to flee.\u201dRussian forces have not commented on the claim, but have rejected previous accusations from Ukraine that they had used phosphorus munitions.In a Telegram post on Sunday, the aide to the exiled Ukrainian mayor of the Russia-occupied coastal city of Mariupol said that there was evidence that Moscow\u2019s forces had intensified their transfer of tracked vehicles through the city and into the frontline Zaporizhzhia region.",
        "Petro Andryushchenko claimed that more and more vehicles were being spotted crossing the city \u201cevery day\u201d.He posted a short video showing heavy trucks transporting armoured vehicles along a road, without specifying where or when it was taken.The Ukrainian General Staff said on Sunday that the evacuation of Enerhodar has already begun.According to an update posted on Facebook, the General Staff said the first residents being moved are those who took Russian citizenship following the capture of the town by Moscow early in the war.They are being taken to the Russia-occupied Azov Sea coast, about 120 miles (200km) to the south-east.Mr Grossi said operating staff at the nuclear power plant, whose six reactors are currently all in shutdown mode, had not been evacuated as of Saturday but that most live in Enerhodar and the situation has contributed to \u201cincreasingly tense, stressful and challenging conditions for personnel and their families\u201d.He added that IAEA experts at the nuclear site \u201care continuing to hear shelling on a regular basis\u201d.\u201cWe must act now to prevent the threat of a severe nuclear accident and its associated consequence for the population and the environment,\u201d Mr Grossi said.\u201cThis major nuclear facility must be protected. I will continue to press for a commitment by all sides to achieve this vital objective.\u201d",
        "Elsewhere, Russian shelling on Saturday and overnight killed six civilians and injured four others in Ukraine\u2019s southern Kherson region, according to a Telegram update published by the local administration on Sunday.Five civilians were injured in the eastern Donetsk region, the epicentre of the fighting in recent months, local governor Pavlo Kyrylenko reported on Sunday morning.Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces overnight attacked the largest port in the Russia-occupied Crimean Peninsula with drones, a Kremlin-installed local official said on Telegram early on Sunday.According to the post by Mikhail Razvozhayev, the governor of Sevastopol, 10 Ukrainian drones targeted the city, three of which were shot down by air defence systems. Mr Razvozhayev said there had been no damage."
