        "One of the world's largest producers of lithium for the electric car industry is expanding its processing plant in Western Australia, bringing 1000 construction jobs.",
        "Albemarle Corporation announced on Wednesday the expansion of the plant at Kemerton, pumping up to $US1.5 billion ($A2.3 billion) into the project, which will make the chemical giant Australia's largest lithium producer.Albemarle CEO Kent Masters said the decision to expand was driven by confidence in future demand.\"Australia is essential to the global supply chain for energy storage and an important part of our diverse portfolio,\" he said.The four processing trains at Kemerton, with trains three and four now given the green light, represents the biggest investment by any company in downstream processing of lithium in Australia.Annual production capacity at four trains will be 100,000 metric tonnes of lithium hydroxide - enough to produce batteries for more than two million electric vehicles each year.Albemarle country manager Beverley East said the company was already a significant employer in the region and had created a specialised manufacturing industry in the southwest of WA.An additional 370 employees would be needed by 2026, bringing the operational workforce to 850, as well as a construction crew of 1000 for the expansion, Ms East said.The additional two trains, wholly owned and operated by Albemarle, will increase the facility's production by 50,000 metric tonnes per year.Located near Bunbury, the plant - a venture with Mineral Resources - is fed by the world's largest hard-rock lithium mine Greenbushes."
