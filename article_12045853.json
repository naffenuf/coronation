        "The tech giant is upgrading Bing Chat with more smart features, allowing users to not only upload images and search the web for related content but also return to previous chats and access and share their chat history, Microsoft said in a blog post.The company has eliminated its waiting list for users to try the new Bing Chat feature and has added a plug-in support so developers and third parties can build on top of Bing to help people take actions on their queries and complete tasks.
