        "The King has been crowned the nation\u2019s monarch and prayed to be a \u201cblessing\u201d to people of \u201cevery faith and conviction\u201d.",
        "Charles became the 40th reigning sovereign to be crowned at Westminster Abbey, the nation\u2019s coronation church since 1066, as Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby placed St Edward\u2019s Crown on his head.The historic moment, watched around the globe, was a fulfilment of the King\u2019s destiny, but followed the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, last September after a 70-year reign.",
        "In a touching moment, the Prince of Wales pledged himself to his father the King, kissing him on the cheek and touching St Edward\u2019s Crown.As William knelt before Charles, who held his son\u2019s hand between his palms, the future monarch said: \u201cI, William, Prince of Wales, pledge my loyalty to you and faith and truth I will bear unto you, as your liege man of life and limb. So help me God.\u201dThe King\u2019s younger son the Duke of Sussex was among the congregation, sitting two rows behind his brother with the Duke of York\u2019s family, and he was seen intently watching the crowning.And when a few minutes later the congregation was invited pay homage to the new monarch, Harry was seen, along with the other royals around him, speaking the words: \u201cGod save King Charles. Long live King Charles. May the King live forever.\u201dThe coronation was a deeply religious ceremony steeped in symbolism and its prayers took the theme of \u201cCalled to Serve\u201d, an attribute associated with the late Queen who pledged her life to the Commonwealth.",
        "Before the crowning the archbishop delivered a sermon to the 2,300 guests, a gathering of world leaders, celebrities, UK politicians, foreign royalty, everyday heroes and the royal family.Mr Welby began by telling the congregation: \u201cWe are here to crown a King, and we crown a King to serve.\u201cWhat is given today is for the gain of all. For Jesus Christ announced a kingdom in which the poor and oppressed are freed from chains of injustice. The blind see. The bruised and broken-hearted are healed.\u201dSpeaking to Charles and Camilla, Mr Welby said: \u201cThe weight of the task given you today, Your Majesties, is only bearable by the spirit of God, who gives us the strength to give our lives to others.",
        "\u201cWith the anointing of the Holy Spirit, the King is given freely what no ruler can ever attain through will, or politics, or war, or tyranny: the Holy Spirit draws us to love in action.\u201dCharles delivered a King\u2019s Prayer, the first time a monarch has spoken words to God aloud during a coronation, and he touched on the duty of the sovereign to serve all communities.He told the abbey: \u201cGod of compassion and mercy whose son was sent not to be served but to serve, give grace that I may find in thy service perfect freedom and in that freedom knowledge of thy truth.",
        "\u201cGrant that I may be a blessing to all thy children, of every faith and conviction, that together we may discover the ways of gentleness and be led into the paths of peace. Through Jesus Christ our Lord, amen.\u201d",
        "In the stillness of the abbey, Mr Welby held St Edward\u2019s Crown high above Charles and, after placing it on his head at 12.02pm, said \u201cGod save the King\u201d \u2013 words loudly repeated by the congregation.The archbishop had adjusted the position of the crown for several seconds before it sat comfortably, and even crouched down to briefly check it was positioned properly on the King\u2019s head.A fanfare was played and the abbey\u2019s bells rang for two minutes after the crowning, with gun salutes fired from nearby Horse Guards Parade, the Tower of London and saluting stations across the nation and from warships at sea.Volleys were heard at Hillsborough, Cardiff and Edinburgh castles, Stonehenge and HMS Lancaster, which had sailed to Sudan to help British citizens and others escape the fighting in Khartoum.In a change, the controversial \u201cHomage of the People\u201d element of the service was toned down after there was widespread criticism of the new element.Mr Welby \u201cinvited\u201d a show of support from the congregation rather than a \u201ccall\u201d to those in the abbey and elsewhere to swear allegiance to the King.",
        "The Queen was then crowned with Queen Mary\u2019s Crown, with Camilla having been anointed in public in a break with tradition.During the crowning the Queen was seen adjusting her hair out of her face.Earlier, Charles and Camilla\u2019s Diamond Jubilee Coach arrived at the abbey, following a procession from Buckingham Palace, in the midst of a Sovereign\u2019s Escort provided by the Household Cavalry\u2019s Blues and Royals and Life Guards with their shining breastplates and plumed helmets and led by the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment band.The monarch and his wife\u2019s entrance through the west door was heralded by a fanfare from four State Trumpeters of the Household Cavalry and the abbey congregation stood as one.A large ceremonial procession was lined up before the King and Queen with representatives of all elements of the nation\u2019s ceremonial and spiritual life.There were recipients of Orders of Chivalry and Gallantry, Heralds from the College of Arms in their colourful tunics, senior clergy associated with the monarchy and the glittering coronation regalia carried by leading figures.St Edward\u2019s Crown was carried by General Sir Gordon Messenger, Lord High Steward of England.",
        "With their lavish and unwieldy robes, the King and Queen walked single file along the nave of the abbey with Camilla ahead of Charles as the hymn I Was Glad As They Said Unto Me was sung.",
        "The coronation service began with a new element when the King was greeted by 14-year-old Samuel Strachan, the longest-serving chorister of the choir of the Chapel Royal, St James\u2019s Palace.The chorister, who attends the City of London School, welcomed the monarch in the name of the \u201cKing of Kings\u201d \u2013 a reference to Jesus Christ \u2013 and Charles replied: \u201cIn his name, and after his example, I come not to be served, but to serve.\u201dBefore the King took the Oath \u2013 making a succession of promises, including to maintain in the UK the Protestant Reformed Religion established by law \u2013 the archbishop delivered a preface to Charles\u2019s declaration \u2013 another first.He told the congregation the Church of England, which is headed by the King, will seek to foster an environment where \u201cpeople of all faiths and beliefs may live freely\u201d \u2013 echoing the words of the late Queen and Charles.Charles was anointed with holy oil away from public view, shielded by the Anointing Screen.",
        "The Dean of Westminster will have poured oil from the ampulla \u2013 an eagle-shaped vessel \u2013 into the coronation spoon \u2013 the oldest object in the coronation regalia.Using his fingers, the archbishop will then have anointed the King on his hands, breast, and head.",
        "The King and Queen left Westminster Abbey in the Gold State Coach shortly after 1pm for a procession back to Buckingham Palace.Thousands of royal fans had braved the rain to line the procession route through central London.As anticipation mounted on Saturday morning, a group of republicans were arrested around 7.30am more than four hours before the coronation service began.Footage on Twitter showed Graham Smith, chief executive of the anti-monarchy group Republic, being apprehended by police in St Martin\u2019s Lane, Westminster.Protest group Just Stop Oil also said approximately 13 demonstrators were arrested on The Mall, as well as five at Downing Street."
