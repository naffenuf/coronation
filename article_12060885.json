        "English writer Daniel Tammet has written nine books so far in his career\u00a0\u00a0Daniel Tammet has been called the world\u2019s greatest mental athlete, and you don\u2019t need to be an intellectual whizz to understand why.",
        "His brain is a thing of wonder, capable of feats that seem almost super-human.In 2004, he was feted for setting a European record for pi memorisation \u2014 reciting the ratio of a circle\u2019s circumference to its diameter to an astonishing 22,514 digits in five hours and nine minutes.The memory man, capable of solving the most complex equations in less time than it takes most of us to tap the numbers into a calculator, was celebrated as a mathematical genius, but numbers were just the beginning.In the years since, Daniel, 44, has written nine books, across an array of genres, and next year he will publish his tenth.",
        "His books have been translated into more than 20 languages. His publishers might want to save themselves some money by getting him to do the translation work himself, given that he speaks 11 of them. One, Icelandic, he learned in a week.\u2018That leaves a lot of languages I don\u2019t speak,\u2019 he points out, lest anyone think he\u2019s run out of challenges. \u2018With something like Japanese, I don\u2019t even know the alphabet.\u2019Do mere mortals feel intimidated, even inferior, in his presence, though? Halfway through our interview, I tell him that I expected to, so presumably it\u2019s an occupational hazard? He looks horrified, even pained.",
        "\u2018Oh no! No one should ever feel inferior. I felt inferior for so long. I couldn\u2019t do anything the other kids could do. I couldn\u2019t ride a bike. I was ten before I could swim, while my brothers and sisters could swim at five or six. On the social side, it was hopeless. Everyone else had friends. I couldn\u2019t make friends.\u2018I would ask: \u201cWhat am I missing? Why can\u2019t I do this?\u201d. To this day, I still can\u2019t drive a car. But at some point in my life, I stopped feeling inferior. I\u2019ve never felt superior, though.\u2018I\u2019ve just reached a point where I realise everyone is so different, and there is a richness in that.\u2019Daniel was on BBC Radio 4 last week, supporting a call for \u2018super memorisers\u2019 to come forward for an academic study about why some people are especially good at retaining information.Volunteers who pass initial tests will be invited for MRI brain scans so that researchers at Cambridge University can assess whether there are differences in their brain function or structure.",
        "You don\u2019t have to be able to recall a string of more than 22,000 digits \u2014 or learn a new language in a week \u2014 to qualify.Anyone who thinks they have a stellar memory can take the preliminary online quiz, which involves challenges such as memorising a phone number or a pattern of chess moves. Those who are considered to have passed with particularly flying colours may then get the call to come to Cambridge.",
        "This is, of course, elementary stuff for Daniel, though he knows what it\u2019s like to be a research guinea pig. His own brain has been thoroughly scanned, including by the team behind the new study.He was diagnosed with autism at the age of 25, and has a rare related condition called savant syndrome, in which people with developmental disorders have amazing abilities.The most famous savant is a fictional one \u2014 the character Raymond Babbitt, as portrayed by Dustin Hoffman in the 1988 film Rain Man. Babbitt was based on a real person, Kim Peek, whose parents were once advised to place him in an institution, and told that a lobotomy would \u2018cure\u2019 his incessant talking, fidgeting and pacing.Daniel, whose own parents knew there was something \u2018wrong\u2019 when he started banging his head against the wall and walking around in circles, met Kim in 2004.He describes the encounter \u2014 the first time he had met a kindred soul who shared his love for books and facts and figures \u2014 as \u2018one of the happiest moments of my life\u2019.Although Daniel was born in Barking, east London, into a working class family \u2014 his dad Kevin was a sheet-metal worker and his mum Jennifer was a secretarial assistant \u2014 his life is now in Paris.",
        "He lives in a small but impeccably placed apartment near Notre Dame with his French husband Jerome Tabet, a 43-year-old photographer and artist, whom he met while promoting his 2006 autobiography.",
        "At night, he likes to trace the lights of the Eiffel Tower as they beam predictable patterns on to the walls. It might seem odd that someone who needs routine, order and familiarity has settled so far from home, but this has been a pattern in his life. When he was 18, he took off to Lithuania to study.\u2018I think there was an element of my condition making me fearless, bizarrely,\u2019 he says.He tells me that when you never feel at ease, even in your own head, then home can be anywhere.He laughs about what they thought of him in Lithuania, where the people he met saw his Britishness before his autistic traits. \u2018People in Lithuania would say to me: \u201cYou are so different, but you are British, eccentric\u201d. It gave me a complete change of perspective, the idea that being on the spectrum isn\u2019t just purely cognitive but almost cultural.\u2019To most of us, numbers are just, well, numbers, sitting boringly on a page. Not so for Daniel, who has synesthesia \u2014 the phenomenon of experiencing one sense through another. \u2018I don\u2019t so much count numbers as dance with them,\u2019 he says, explaining how, to him, every number has a three-dimensional shape, each with a distinctive colour.",
        "When numbers combine, his brain becomes a swirl of yellows, blues and greens. He not only \u2018sees\u2019 these numbers but feels them. \u2018They are my friends,\u2019 he adds. He feels pi \u2014 the never-ending number \u2014 most of all.When he describes getting to a crucial point in his famous pi recital, which involves a series of nines, you can actually feel the excitement bounce off him.",
        "\u2018It\u2019s a point in pi \u2014 after 762 digits \u2014 that fascinates mathematicians. The chances of getting 999999 is literally one in a million, yet it comes after just 762. When I got there, my voice got deeper and my whole demeanour changed because nine is a very heavy number for me. It\u2019s dark.\u2019Among those who understood his reaction was the singer Kate Bush, who went on to write a song about pi, and Daniel\u2019s relationship to it, which is mind-blowing in itself.\u2018Yes, but she got that, which was amazing because it meant I had found my voice. It\u2019s just paradoxical that I had to find it in numbers before I could find it in words.\u2019This may be a man with a mind-boggling memory \u2014 not for him are concerns about remembering all the passwords modern life now requires \u2014 who can do equations seemingly without thinking and write beautifully crafted prose (he has been compared to Hemingway), but he cannot use a mobile phone or drive a car.",
        "\u2018Technically, yes, I am disabled,\u2019 he says. \u2018But do I feel disabled, or abled? That\u2019s difficult because there are things I cannot do \u2014 things that neurotypical people do without thinking.\u2019Like driving? \u2018Yes. I took the theory test twice and got 100 per cent each time, but the practical side was difficult. If I see a detail on a number plate I can be distracted, or if the light comes in a certain way it can divert my attention. At speed that can be dangerous.\u2019In much the same way that I marvel at how he can multiply 384 by 6,943 (answer: 2,666,112) in his head, in seconds, so he marvels at my ability to change a clutch while not crashing the car.\u2018Neurotypical cognition fascinates me,\u2019 he says, beaming. \u2018You can make split-second adjustments without even realising you are doing it, and you don\u2019t even give yourself credit for it.\u2019The sad part is that it took so long for him to give himself credit for his more unusual strengths. At school, like so many people who are neurodiverse, Daniel was simply the odd kid who acted in weird ways.\u2018To the teachers I was the perfect student,\u2019 he says. \u2018But to the other children I was just weird.\u2019 He was always last to be picked at sports. He was the one with no friends and, no, he was absolutely not happy to be in his own little world, even if it was a genius world.He is wary of suggestions that neurodiversity can be a \u2018superpower\u2019, because mostly it\u2019s not.\u2018I still want to fit in as much as possible. If someone had asked me as a child, \u201cDo you want to be like everyone else?\u201d I would have said \u201cYes\u201d in a heartbeat. I didn\u2019t have the awareness that what I had could be special. It wasn\u2019t a gift. I just didn\u2019t want to feel left out, to be bullied for being different.\u2019Kids like Daniel are still falling through the cracks, but he credits his parents, Kevin and Jennifer, for making sure he did not. \u2018What they gave me was unconditional love and acceptance,\u2019 he says.Daniel was the oldest of nine siblings and a very difficult baby who cried incessantly. At three he suffered from epileptic fits (which can be linked to autism). At school he simply didn\u2019t know how to communicate, which is extraordinary given his eloquence and emotional fluency now. \u2018I did not know how to talk to other children. I didn\u2019t have the language. I remember getting our vaccinations and someone talking \u2014 joking, obviously \u2014 about our arms falling off. I took it literally. I was terrified.\u2019He was a prolific reader. The school library was his sanctuary and he reckons he taught himself how to communicate by studying its books. It didn\u2019t work immediately. \u2018I\u2019d go and emulate what I\u2019d read, not realising the books were from the 1940s and 1950s. The other children would say: \u201cWhy are you talking funny? What is wrong with you?\u201d.\u2019He had to learn about making eye contact, too. \u2018The teachers and my parents would say: \u201cYou have to look at me\u201d, which I just didn\u2019t understand. Then I\u2019d look too much, and they\u2019d say: \u201cStop staring\u201d.\u2019As well as books about the brain (his own, and others) he has written a detective novel where the lead character is neurodiverse, and makes connections that solve crimes.His next book has involved meeting others on the spectrum. He tells me of the blind autistic woman he met who can walk into a room and tell how many chairs are in there. This blows his mind, too. \u2018There is so much we still do not understand about how the brain works,\u2019 he says. Which is exactly why he supports so much scientific study.He could have monetised his genius more, though he says he has made a very good living from writing.After his pi triumph and a subsequent documentary about his life, a programme-maker in Los Angeles offered him his own TV show. He turned it down, because he \u2018didn\u2019t want to be a performing seal\u2019.\u2018It was about the time they were poaching lots of British people, such as Piers Morgan and Anne Robinson. They offered me a TV series where I would be given time to study in a certain field, then be pitted against experts.\u2018It was life-changing money and I am from a very working-class background, so of course I was tempted, but ultimately those around me said: \u201cYes, it will change your life, but not necessarily in ways you want it to\u201d.\u2019It takes a man who knows his own mind \u2014 and all the complexities within \u2014 to make that decision.To see if you are a \u2018super memoriser\u2019 and for more information about the research, go to cam.ac.uk/research/news/search-is -on-for-super- memorisers-to-help-scientists-unlock-the-secrets-of-memory"
