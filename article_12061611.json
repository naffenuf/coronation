        "Andrew: The Problem Prince **Prepare to feel 13 per cent better. According to social scientists at Imperial College London, nations that take part in Eurovision enjoy a measurable mood boost for days afterwards, even if they come last.For the UK this year, 13 per cent sounds like a serious underestimate. With a week-long build-up to the song contest on Saturday, climaxing in the mega-budget celebration in Liverpool, we ought to be walking on sunshine.Compound that with national euphoria in the wake of the Coronation and Britain might very soon be the happiest country in the world.\u00a0Eurovision spirit is reaching parts and people usually oblivious to the joys of the event. Comedian Jason Manford admitted, in Eurovision Calling: Jason And Chelcee\u2019s Ultimate Guide (BBC1), that before chancing to switch on the show last year, he\u2019d never even heard Sam Ryder\u2019s entry Space Man.But he has succumbed to the addictive optimism of the competition now. By the end of the hour, he was on stage in a gay pub in Manchester, belting out Conchita Wurst\u2019s Rise Like A Phoenix, the winning anthem from 2014.",
        "Eurovision gives everyone a licence to be camp for a night. Sequins and feather boas are not compulsory but, if they make you feel 13 per cent better, why not? You might suppose it started with Abba, and the neon jumpsuits Anni-Frid and Agnetha wore for Waterloo in 1974.\u00a0",
        "But a clip unearthed by Jason and co-presenter Chelcee Grimes, of the UK\u2019s 1968 entry Congratulations, suggests the real godfather of glam was Cliff Richard. Our eternal bachelor boy wore a suit with a ruffled shirtfront that was worthy of Austin Powers.This year, we\u2019re represented by Mae Muller, with a cynically formulaic number called I Wrote A Song. Jason chatted with her over a pot of tea, though he avoided asking the Corbynista songster any tricky questions, such as, \u2018You posted on Twitter that you \u201chate this country\u201d \u2014 don\u2019t you think it\u2019s hypocritical to represent us at Eurovision?\u2019Mae has previously said that it\u2019s crucial she does the competition, because, \u2018a lot of young women follow me and it\u2019s important that they can see they can have a voice\u2019.Sadly, she doesn\u2019t have much of a voice herself \u2014 it\u2019s thin and slightly nasal, not the sort of soaring, theatrical sound that traditionally does well at Eurovision. This year\u2019s winner is more likely to be Sweden\u2019s Loreen, who triumphed in 2012 with Euphoria.\u00a0But even she might struggle against Ukraine\u2019s entry, Heart Of Steel by Torchii. Public support could well mean that Ukraine matches Ireland, Israel, Luxembourg and Spain, by winning two years on the trot.We can be sure of one thing. In the Kremlin, no one will dare to sport sequins and feather boas.",
        "Emily Maitlis didn\u2019t go that far in celebrating her Newsnight interview with Prince Andrew, which ended his career as a working royal. But there was a strong note of gloating about the second part of Andrew: The Problem Prince (Ch4).\u00a0",
        "Blurred reconstructions showed Emily arriving at Buckingham Palace, clutching a shoulder bag with a change of clothes and her notes. The brand logo on the bag was Sweaty Betty \u2014 a sarky reference to the prince\u2019s claim that an overdose of adrenaline during the Falklands War left him unable to sweat.Remarkably, she said he\u2019d already told her about his perspiration deficit during conversations before the interview.After filming was done, he invited her to join him for a film. Thursdays are cinema nights at the palace, apparently. Emily made her excuses and left."
