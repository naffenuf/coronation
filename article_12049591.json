        "Alastair Cook was announced as England\u2019s new one-day captain on this day in 2011.",
        "Cook replaced his Test match opening partner Andrew Strauss, who retired from the format, while Stuart Broad took over from Paul Collingwood to lead the Twenty20 side.Strauss said: \u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed my time as England one-day captain immensely and I\u2019m extremely proud of the strides we\u2019ve made in limited overs cricket over the past two years.",
        "\u201cWe still have a long way to go if we\u2019re to achieve our goal of winning ICC global events and I feel now is the right time for me to step aside and ensure someone else takes up that challenge.\u201cI look forward to working closely with both Alastair and Stuart as we work together to progress England\u2019s development across all forms of the game.\u201dCook was the stand-out batter during the historic Ashes success the previous winter, scoring a record 766 runs, but was not included for the subsequent one-day series against Australia or the World Cup and had played sparingly in ODIs.He said: \u201cAndrew Strauss has led the one-day team to continued success over the past two years and I\u2019ll be looking to continue that progress as captain.",
        "\u201cI\u2019m excited by the challenge of taking our 50-over cricket to new heights and I believe I can play an integral role with the bat as well as captain.\u201d",
        "Cook also became Test captain the following year and broke numerous batting records during a career that ended in 2018.His record in the one-day game was considerably less impressive, though, and his captaincy ended in December 2014, with Eoin Morgan taking over ahead of the World Cup."
