        "A police officer who left a man paralysed from the waist down after tasering him has been accused of being a liar while undergoing cross-examination.",
        "Pc Imran Mahmood, 36, is charged with unlawfully inflicting grievous bodily harm on Jordan Walker-Brown during a patrol in the early months of the first lockdown on May 4 2020.Mr Walker-Brown, who was 23 at the time, was left with \u201ccatastrophic\u201d injuries after hitting his head on the pavement and breaking his back.Southwark Crown Court heard that Mahmood \u2013 attached to the Metropolitan Police\u2019s territorial support group (TSG) which deals with outbreaks of public disorder \u2013 chased Mr Walker-Brown on foot after noticing him walking along the pavement in Burgoyne Road, Haringey, north London. I\u2019m not a liar. I was just trying to do my job  Imran Mahmood  Mahmood was said to have used his Taser when Mr Walker-Brown jumped on to a wheelie bin to climb over a fence in the front garden of a house, creating such an electric shock that it caused him to tumble backwards over the wall, land head-first on the footpath and break his back.The officer told jurors he discharged his Taser after Mr Walker-Brown \u201cturned around\u201d on top of the bins, adding that he \u201chonestly\u201d believed the younger man was in possession of a weapon and going to attack him.",
        "During cross-examination on Friday, prosecutor Ben FitzGerald KC said: \u201cThe truth is that he was about to get over the wall and you fired to stop him getting away.\u201d",
        "Mahmood replied: \u201cThat is incorrect.\u201dMr FitzGerald went on: \u201cI\u2019m afraid you had to make up a false account afterwards to justify what you did.\u201d\u201cNo, that is incorrect,\u201d Mahmood replied. \u201cI\u2019m not a liar. I was just trying to do my job.\u201dThe prosecutor pressed: \u201cI\u2019m afraid you are a liar, Mr Mahmood.\u201d it was my honest held belief that Mr Walker-Brown was in possession of a knife and he was a threat to me, my colleagues and anyone around  Imran Mahmood  Mahmood accepted he did not see Mr Walker-Brown take out a weapon and the alleged victim made no movement towards him with a weapon.But the officer said he was \u201cadamant\u201d at the time that Mr Walker-Brown had a knife and \u201chonestly believed\u201d he was going to attack him.Mr FitzGerald asked: \u201cWas it the case that in that moment of anger and frustration that he would not follow your commands that you fired the Taser?\u201d\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Mahmood said.He insisted it was to protect himself and others and that it was a reasonable use of force.Mahmood agreed there was an \u201cobvious risk of injury\u201d from using a Taser in the situation.Taken through still images of his bodyworn video which captured the incident, Mahmood said it could \u201cclearly\u201d be seen from the footage that Mr Walker-Brown\u2019s \u201cwhole body\u201d was \u201cturned towards\u201d him, but later added that the images are \u201cquite fuzzy\u201d and make it \u201chard to tell\u201d.",
        "He told the court: \u201cYou have got to appreciate that this is a fast-moving situation.\u201cThese stills are within the same time period and (with) the information I had at the start and during the chase, it was my honest-held belief that Mr Walker-Brown was in possession of a knife and he was a threat to me, my colleagues and anyone around \u2013 including the occupants of that address.\u201dThe officer, from Plaistow in east London, does not dispute inflicting grievous bodily harm but denies it was unlawful.Mahmood has finished giving evidence and the trial continues on Tuesday."
