        "New director of football Brian McDermott is relishing the chance to unearth quality players for Hibernian after being appointed to a role that will revolve heavily around recruitment.",
        "The 62-year-old is best known for a managerial career that incorporated two spells at Reading either side of a stint at Leeds, but he was chief scout at the Madejski Stadium for nine years prior to becoming a boss and has worked predominantly in scouting roles since being sacked by the Royals in 2016.McDermott feels player recruitment is his speciality and believes that will stand him in good stead for a role he learned a lot about while working under the \u201cfantastic\u201d Nick Hammond at Reading.\u201cI relish that, I love finding players,\u201d he said. \u201cI was head scout at Reading for nine years and I wasn\u2019t looking to become the manager because I loved finding players.\u201cWe found so many really good players, that\u2019s my thing. I did the same at Arsenal (between 2016 and 2020) and really relished that.\u201cI became the Reading manager by default and did OK and then I ended up at Leeds and whatever, but I think finding players is my thing.",
        "\u201cI get a buzz out of recruitment. I\u2019ve recruited well as a manager and I\u2019ve recruited not so well, and when you don\u2019t recruit well you don\u2019t do so well. It is so important.\u201dMcDermott insists he had not planned on becoming a director of football but he feels the Hibs role \u2013 which will require him to work closely with manager Lee Johnson and also revolves around scouting, analysis, sports science and the academy \u2013 suited him at this stage in his life.",
        "\u201cI never really make conscious decisions,\u201d said McDermott, who did some scouting for cinch Premiership side Celtic after leaving Arsenal. \u201cThis opportunity came along and I thought \u2018yeah, that\u2019s something I really want to do\u2019.\u201cJob titles to me are not important. I like to be involved with people and doing the best I can with people. It\u2019s not about the job title or me or whatever, it\u2019s always about the football club.\u201cI kind of did this job between 2000 and 2009 but without having the title of director of football. Nick Hammond was the director of football but I involved myself in every part of the football club because I wanted to. I was doing mad hours but I loved it.\u201cNick was a fantastic director of football to work under so I know how the role works and it\u2019s something I\u2019m really looking forward to.\u201d"
