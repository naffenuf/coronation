        "Morecambe manager Derek Adams felt his side did all they could to stay up after a 3-2 defeat at Exeter saw the Shrimps condemned to relegation from League One.",
        "After a dire first half, Jay Stansfield put Exeter in front, only for Cole Stockton to equalise and give Morecambe hope of staying up.But Stansfield dashed those hopes with two more to complete his hat-trick before Stockton\u2019s consolation strike, deep into 14 minutes of stoppage time.\u201cWe needed to try and win today and it was 0-0 at half-time,\u201d Adams said. \u201cWe knew Cambridge were 2-0 up so it meant we definitely needed to win the game.\u201cWe tried our best but they scored a goal early in the second half. We pulled one back but then they got a second. We found it difficult after that because we were chasing the game and there were big holes all over the pitch.\u201cWe took nearly 900 supporters with us today which is fantastic. Not so long ago, we didn\u2019t have 900 home supporters, it is fantastic they have come with us today.",
        "\u201cWe had tremendous backing throughout the season. But it is not about losing today, it is over the season. The players have given their best.\u201cIt was cagey in the first half, neither side really threatened the goalkeeper. If we scored a wee bit earlier, we might have been able to pull it back as there was a lot of injury time.",
        "\u201cThe players gave everything and worked hard throughout the campaign and we just came up short.\u201dAs for Exeter, the day belonged to Stansfield in was the final game of his loan spell from Fulham.The 20-year-old celebrated his hat-trick goal by running towards and pointing to the stand that bears his late father\u2019s name in what was a truly emotional moment.City boss Gary Caldwell said: \u201cJay is brilliant and I am running out of words to describe him.\u201cHe\u2019s an absolute pleasure to work with and he has had difficult periods in the season where he doesn\u2019t score, but he\u2019s a fantastic team player \u2013 he works hard for the team.\u201cHe does all the right things in terms of his preparation and how he trains and that (hat-trick) was well deserved for all of his hard work this season and I am delighted that he had that moment with the supporters inside the stadium.\u201dOn his team\u2019s performance, Caldwell added: \u201cIt is always good to win games of football. I thought we were the better team throughout.\u201cIn the first half, I thought the possession was too slow, but we came out with a better intensity, we played much quicker and we scored three brilliant goals.\u201cI was disappointed with the two goals we conceded and that is an area we definitely have to improve next season but, overall, after the season we have had and the run we\u2019ve been on, I am delighted to finish with a win.\u201d"
