        "May 3 (Reuters) - Swiss dental implant maker Straumann Holding on Wednesday reported organic sales growth of 3.4% for the first quarter, helped by robust demand across most of its markets.",
        "The dental healthcare company confirmed its outlook of organic sales growth in the high-single-digit percentage range in 2023, and profitability at around 25% including growth investments.\"We are confirming our full-year outlook despite the uncertainties around potential economic and geopolitical impacts,\" CEO Guillaume Daniellot said in a statement.The company said all geographies performed well in the first quarter, except for China, where the combined impact of COVID-19 lockdowns, lagging patient flows, and the Chinese Volume-Based Procurement (VBP) pricing hampered growth.A tender programme for healthcare products aimed at lowering costs for consumers, China's VBP has driven average selling prices to a much lower level.Sales plunged 23.5% in Asia-Pacific (APAC), including China, Straumann's key market in the region. Excluding China, APAC delivered a \"solid performance\", the company added.The company, which specialises in tooth replacement and orthodontic solutions, reported revenue of 596 million Swiss francs ($668.84 million) in the three months to the end of March, compared with 588.9 million francs a year ago.($1 = 0.8911 Swiss francs) (Reporting by Andrey Sychev and Anna Mackenzie in Gdansk; Editing by Christian Schmollinger and Rashmi Aich)"
