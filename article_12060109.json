        "Scotland\u2019s First Minister is confident his party can win next year\u2019s general election and any subsequent independence referendum the SNP can extract in a hung parliament.",
        "Projections last week following the local elections in England\u00a0suggested Labour could struggle to gain an overall majority at Westminster in the UK-wide vote expected next year, if the result was to be repeated, with the SNP keen to make clear its negotiating position in a hung parliament.Over the weekend, the party\u2019s deputy Westminster leader Mhairi Black said Labour would have to give up an independence referendum for SNP support after the election \u2013 a long held position for the party \u2013 while claiming her MPs would work to pull Labour to the left. I'd be confident of both winning the general election and confident, of course, of winning an independence referendum  Humza Yousaf  Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, however, has repeatedly said there will be no deals with the SNP after an election.Mr Yousaf\u2019s confidence comes after six weeks of turmoil at the top of his party, with former chief executive \u2013 and Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s husband \u2013 Peter Murrell and then-treasurer Colin Beattie arrested in connection with a police probe into the SNP\u2019s finances, along with the search of Mr Murrell and Ms Sturgeon\u2019s home and party headquarters.Speaking to the PA news agency during a visit to a community larder in Dundee on Monday, the First Minister said: \u201cI\u2019d be confident of both winning the general election and confident, of course, of winning an independence referendum.",
        "\u201cWe have the arguments, the positive vision, even with all the real challenges the party has had over the last six weeks.\u201cI\u2019m not going to pretend it\u2019s been anything other than very, very difficult, maybe some of the most difficult weeks the SNP has faced, certainly in modern history.\u201dHe added: \u201cEven with that, support for independence, we know, is still by and large rock solid, and we\u2019re going to continue to build on that.\u201dA recent poll by Redfield and Wilton, done towards the end of last month, suggested support for independence was around 45% \u2013 the same as the 2014 referendum.The First Minister went on to say he was \u201cpretty disturbed\u201d by what he described as \u201clurching more and more to the right\u201d, adding that the SNP could obtain the \u201cprize\u201d of an independence referendum, as well as \u201ckicking the Tories out of Scotland\u201d.Asked about Labour\u2019s steadfast refusal to countenance a deal with the SNP, the First Minister said: \u201cI think what is said before a general election and in the midst of a campaign is very different when the realpolitik kicks in.\u201cI would work, frankly, with any progressive party to see the back of the Tories, that price for cooperating with Labour undoubtedly, from our perspective, would be demanding that Section 30, which is of course our right given our mandates that we\u2019ve won, but it will also be to put firmly the progressive agenda front and centre of not just Scottish politics but UK politics.\u201d",
        "Alex Cole-Hamilton, leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, said: \u201cI think most Scots understand that even a decade on from the independence referendum, the SNP haven\u2019t got a clue what to do about currency, pensions or borders. They\u2019re as lax and haphazard as the Brexiteers.\u201cAt least Humza Yousaf is being honest with the public when he spells out that any leverage he has will be focused towards breaking up the UK, rather than on improving public services.\u201d"
