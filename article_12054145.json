        "Tottenham have asked Barcelona to give them a price for Franck KessieThe midfielder looks to be one player who could be sold by the club this year\u00a0He has fallen out of favour in Xavi's side having started five league games\u00a0Tottenham have reportedly asked Barcelona to 'give them a price' for midfielder Franck Kessie.\u00a0",
        "The 26-year-old signed for the club in July 2022 and while he has made 39 appearances for the Catalan side, he has struggled to cement himself as a regular face in Xavi's first XI, having started just five LaLiga games this season.\u00a0Tottenham have been long-standing admirers of Kessie, notably submitting a \u00a313m bid to sign the Ivory Coast midfielder back in December.\u00a0While Kessie had struggled to find his feet at Barcelona, he rejected that approach from Spurs, as well as an offer to return to his former club AC Milan, and also rejected a wage cut, as the club looked to free-up some cash to re-sign Lionel Messi.But according to SPORT, Daniel Levy's side have once again inquired about the player and it seems this time he could leave the club, with the outlet reporting that he 'is one of the players chosen to leave Barca as of June 30.'\u00a0",
        "It comes as cash-strapped Barca are looking to balance their books before the end of June, in a bid to ensure they can make new signings this summer and hold on to some of their key talents.\u00a0The LaLiga leaders are currently mired by debts of\u00a0\u00a31.33 billion (\u20ac1.5bn), are embroiled in a corruption case\u00a0and must raise funds of \u00a3177 million (\u20ac200m) in order to be able to make transfers this summer.\u00a0",
        "Kessie's departure could help to alleviate the financial squeeze the club are facing, with the Spainsh outlet saying: 'The club's [Barcelona's] goal is to close a direct sale and Tottenham has asked for a price in recent days.'\u00a0Despite having signed him less than a year ago, he could be one of several players to leave this summer, with Newcastle also reportedly having bid \u00a360m for Raphinha.\u00a0",
        "Kessie, who has 58 caps for the Ivory Coast, was the first signing in a big summer swoop by the Catalans, who also\u00a0acquired Robert Lewandowski for \u00a342.5m, Raphinha for \u00a356m\u00a0and Jules Kounde for \u00a356m, but had initially struggled to register the defender.\u00a0Kessie joined from AC Milan on a free transfer, but he has struggled to cement his place in the side, starting just 14 times in 39 appearances across all competitions.\u00a0It is a far cry from his form in Italy, where the 26-year-old made 25 starts for Milan in the Serie A alone last season, making 39 appearances across all competitions, before scoring seven times for the Italian giants.\u00a0Given regular game time, he could become an important player at Tottenham, who are also keeping tabs on several other midfielders, including James Ward-Prowse.\u00a0"
