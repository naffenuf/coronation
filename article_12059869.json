        "Manager Dave Challinor has challenged Stockport to take their impressive form into the play-offs after missing out on an automatic promotion spot with a 1-1 draw against Hartlepool.",
        "County needed to win and hope Northampton didn\u2019t if they were to overtake them but they will now have to face Salford in the post-season.Callum Cooke\u2019s second-half strike cancelled out Callum Camps\u2019 penalty to give relegated Hartlepool a point, with the latter also having a stoppage-time spot-kick saved by Ben Killip.Challinor, whose side are unbeaten since February, said: \u201cIn terms of the amount of chances we created and the amount of shots we had on goal, that\u2019s probably the most we\u2019ve had all season, which is really positive.\u201cWe\u2019ve not played that well but still created plenty of chances and that will be important going into the play-offs where those moments are few and far between.\u201cWhat I can\u2019t complain about is how much we\u2019ve hit the target, their keeper has made some brilliant saves and got them a point.",
        "\u201cWe\u2019re on a brilliant run, we have to make sure that continues into the play-offs. If we do we\u2019ll have a really good chance of progressing.\u201cBut the four teams are really well matched, four really good teams who are there on merit \u2013 it\u2019s the toss of a coin how it will turn out.\u201cThe play-offs are certainly the best way to go up but they\u2019re also the worst way for your season to end. The jeopardy throughout a league season is always there, in the play-offs it\u2019s enhanced tenfold.",
        "\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to it because they\u2019re moments you want to be involved in, we have to embrace it.\u201cWe\u2019ve got to win three football matches to get out of this division and if we\u2019d been offered that at the start we\u2019d have taken it.\u201dHartlepool\u2019s relegation had already been sealed but, thanks to Killip in his first game since January, they at least finished with a draw.Killip couldn\u2019t save Camps\u2019 first-half penalty but his string of fine saves was completed by a stop from the midfielder\u2019s second spot-kick of the afternoon deep into stoppage time.Manager John Askey\u2019s thought are already on rebuilding the Pools squad for a tilt at the National League title he won as Macclesfield boss in 2018.He said: \u201cAs daft as it sounds because we\u2019ve gone down, I\u2019m pleased we\u2019ve come here and got a point.\u201cComing here we knew the situation and I was hoping the players would put on a performance for the supporters \u2013 and they did that. I couldn\u2019t ask any more of them in a difficult situation to be in.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy for Ben to come in and play like that but you couldn\u2019t ask any more from a goalkeeper, he made some tremendous saves, he\u2019s shown what a good goalkeeper he is.",
        "\u201cObviously it was still a little bit flat but we\u2019ve got to forget this season and move on to the next one.\u201cIt\u2019s an important time for us now, we need to recruit well and get players in that will suit the way we want to play. There are one or two going, one or two who we\u2019ll try to move on as well.\u201cWe need more athleticism in the team, we need more pace and it\u2019s up to us to try to get those players.\u201cWe can\u2019t have a massive overhaul but where we can we\u2019ll try to bring in better players and I\u2019ll be doing my best to try to get a winning team together.\u201d"
