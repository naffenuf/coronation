        "Celtic captain Callum McGregor believes his team can continue to improve after retaining the cinch Premiership title in style.",
        "The Hoops wrapped up their 11th title in 12 years with four games remaining thanks to a 2-0 victory over Hearts at Tynecastle.The champions have only lost once in the league, against St Mirren in September, and can set a top-flight points record of 107 if they win their remaining matches.Midfielder McGregor told Sky Sports: \u201cI think there\u2019s the makings of a really special team.\u201cYou see when the going gets tough you have to fight the game out a little bit, like we had to do first half. So we have got that side of it, which you need to have if you want to be champions.\u201cAnd you see at the end there with the quality we could probably score another two or three goals.\u201d",
        "When asked if they could get even better, the 29-year-old said: \u201cWe are certainly on the right track but we have to keep on working.\u201cYou can see it, you can see it \u2013 a lot of young players. You get over the line and you get more experience. You want to do it again the following season and you want to do it in a better style.\u201cI believe we have done that this season and there is always more to come.\u201d",
        "McGregor has won four out of five domestic trophies so far as skipper and can lead the team to the treble when they face Championship side Inverness in the Scottish Cup final on June 3.\u201cIt\u2019s a dream come true for me, it\u2019s such a privilege, every day that I come into my work and represent this club, represent these guys,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an absolute pleasure.\u201cAt the start of the season this is always what the club wants, it demands success. Over a period of 38 games you have to be the best team and the best team will win the league.\u201cI\u2019m so happy for the players, the staff, the supporters, everybody connected with the club. A really special day again.\u201d"
