Send your pictures and videos to pictures@mailonline.co.uk\u00a0Some will be looking out for the tiniest glimpse of the anointing (good luck with that) or the glint of the Great Star of Africa, the world\u2019s largest diamond, in the head of the Sceptre.",
        "Historians and theologians won\u2019t know where to start. Royal-watchers will be waiting to see who steals the show. Prince Harry? Prince Louis? The page boys?And then there is the music...Everyone, surely, will be waiting for that extraordinary moment when St Edward\u2019s Crown is lowered and the cry echoes around the Abbey: \u2018God save the King!\u2019However you may be intending to watch, it will be a day we remember for a long time. But what to look out for and when?",
        "5am-6amAnyone wanting to watch the procession with their own eyes will find that the best positions in Central London were taken by hardy campers who have been lining The Mall for days. The authorities are asking people not to arrive on the day before 6am, when viewing areas will open along the route. Steel gates control access to the processional area.",
        "The award for the most ostentatious gown surely goes to Queen Caroline, wife of George II, whose dress for the 1727 Coronation was so encrusted with jewels a pulley had to be designed to hold up the skirt so she could kneel down to be crowned.\u00a0",
        "When the police decide the area is full, the gates will shut and people will be redirected to six public viewing areas, in Green Park, St James\u2019s Park and Hyde Park. There are 57 all over Britain.",
        "6am-7amThe first guests will already be making their way to Westminster Abbey, ready for the 7.15am opening of extensive ticket and security checks. If you are coming by Tube (St James\u2019s Park is shut all day), listen out for an unusual \u2018Mind the Gap\u2019 message \u2014 recorded by the King.7am-8amThe 2,200 ticketed guests will already be filling the Abbey. At 7.30am, BBC1 viewers will join Kirsty Young for the start of seven-and-a-half hours of non-stop coverage on both BBC1 and BBC2 (the latter with sign language).8am-9amThe last non-VIP guests will be taking their seats, even though there are still hours to go before the service begins. All regular guests have been told to be seated by 9am.\u00a0Viewers will recognise some of the personal guests such as Ant and Dec or Lionel Richie, as well as the county representatives, the Lord-Lieutenants and a small cluster of MPs and peers drawn by lottery (with 50 seats for each chamber \u2014 and no plus ones).\u00a0At 8.30am, ITV viewers will join Tom Bradby and Julie Etchingham. Those along the route will effectively be locked in position as the processional route is declared \u2018sterile\u2019 from 9am onwards.9am-10amStreet-lining troops are now taking up their positions and will all be in place by 9.40am. From 9.30am, TV viewers will start to see heads of state, prime ministers (and British former prime ministers) and junior foreign royalty take their seats.\u00a0",
        "Huw Edwards will be the BBC\u2019s commentator inside the Abbey. \u2018Very limited toilet facilities\u2019 inside will shut at 10am and will not reopen until 1.30pm.10am-11amBy now, everyone will be glued to the royal arrivals, especially that of the Dukes of Sussex and York. Last into the Abbey before Their Majesties will be the Prince and Princess of Wales with their two younger children. As a page to the King, Prince George will be lining up separately.At precisely 10.20am, the King and Queen will set off for the Abbey in the Diamond Jubilee State Coach. The newest addition to the Royal Mews, it is a masterpiece of engineering by Australian coachmaker Jim Frecklington.",
        "The monarch with the most illegitimate children at his Coronation was William IV, who invited four of his ten children by the actress Mrs Jordan.William, who was 64, declared he wanted his 1831 Coronation to be a cut-price event.\u00a0It was called a \u2018half-crown ceremony\u2019 by his enemies, although it cost \u00a32 million in today\u2019s money.\u00a0",
        "It is a travelling museum of our history, with everything from fragments of the Stone of Destiny to slivers of the climber\u2019s ladder which helped the conquerors of Everest to the summit in 1953.The crown on top is from HMS Victory and conceals a hidden \u2018coachcam\u2019 for a CCTV camera.\u00a0",
        "The journey to the Abbey, called the King\u2019s Procession, will progress at a walk, with a much smaller following than the great cavalcade which follows later in the day. This is a reflection of the monarch arriving in humility, with the grandeur and splendour yet to come.Clare Balding will take over the BBC commentary. At 10.53am precisely the coach arrives at the Abbey and the King and Queen Consort emerge to line up for the royal procession, assisted by their pages who will help carry their robes of state.11am-12 noonThe service opens with the traditional sound of the scholars of Westminster School, high in the triforium, shouting/singing \u2018Vivat Rex\u2019 and \u2018Vivat Regina\u2019. For the first time, they include female voices since the school now has a co-educational sixth-form.We hear the soaring I Was Glad by Sir Hubert Parry (one of the King\u2019s favourite composers) as the vast procession streams through the Abbey. Britain old and new is here in force. Following the junior heralds (pursuivants) in their tabards, come the orders of chivalry and gallantry.Next come the quarterings of the Royal Arms (look out for the young Duke of Westminster in this bit) and the Royal Standard, carried by Francis Dymoke, the Hereditary King\u2019s Champion, whose family have been part of every coronation since William the Conqueror.",
        "Next up come the clergy, the heralds and the procession of the regalia. The latter has virtually emptied the Jewel House of the Tower of London.Its keeper, Brigadier Andrew Jackson, carries the ring, perhaps the smallest element in a priceless parade of crowns, sceptres, swords, armills and spurs.\u00a0The Great Officers of State are all here \u2014 and, for the first time, a woman will be among them: Penny Mordaunt, Lord President of the Council and bearer of the Sword of State. Here too are women bishops, officiating at a Coronation for the first time.",
        "The King reaches his Chair of Estate, the first of three thrones he will use during the service. And the first voice we hear will be that of a child.\u00a0Chorister Sam Strachan of the Choir of the Chapel Royal will welcome the King on behalf of everyone, to which the King replies: \u2018I come not to be served but to serve.\u2019 It is one of a few new elements introduced to a service rooted in rituals laid down in the 10th and 14th centuries, plus elements of the Old Testament.The service then follows the time-honoured rituals of the Recognition and the Oath. Listen out for an additional oath promising an \u2018environment in which people of all faiths and beliefs may live freely\u2019 \u2014 articulating the King\u2019s long-held view that a monarch should be a defender of \u2018faiths\u2019.",
        "A lesson read by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is followed by something we have not seen at a Coronation for many reigns: a sermon by the Archbishop of Canterbury.12 noon-1pmDepending on the length of Justin Welby\u2019s address, we will be hitting the great anointing moment at around noon. By now, the King has moved to his second - and principal - Throne, St Edward\u2019s Chair, facing the altar. Here is the one part of the entire proceedings off-limits to everyone, even members of the Royal Family.",
        "Elizabeth II went to her Coronation in the Golden State Coach, but in 1761 the 22-year-old George III and 17-year-old Queen Charlotte were carried to the Abbey in sedan chairs.\u00a0At that ceremony, the Archbishop of Canterbury\u2019s sermon was almost inaudible because the congregation were opening bottles of wine and eating.\u00a0",
        "Soldiers from each regiment of the Household Division step forward carrying a special screen - embroidered with the names of every country of the Commonwealth - to shield the moment when the Archbishop dabs holy oil on the King\u2019s head, chest and arms. This is a moment between the King and the Almighty.Next, comes the investiture as members of different communities and Christian denominations present the King with the regalia, piece by piece.Finally, the moment has come. Addressing the ultimate monarch, \u2018King of Kings, Lord of Lords\u2019, the Archbishop lifts up St Edward\u2019s Crown and crowns Charles III.\u00a0The Abbey erupts with God Save The King. From Horse Guards to the Tower of London, to saluting stations around the nation, in Gibraltar and on ships at sea, 21-gun salutes will be fired simultaneously. The bells of the Abbey ring.The King is then enthroned, moving to his third seat of the day, the Throne Chair. Here, he receives a much-shortened homage \u2014 just the Archbishop and the Prince of Wales.\u00a0At which point, we are all invited to join in. This is the bit that has aroused hours of needless squawking. If you don\u2019t want to pledge allegiance in front of family and friends, make a cup of tea.Next comes the anointing of Queen Camilla - a scaled-back version but one which will be on camera - and her crowning. Listen out for Andrew Lloyd Webber\u2019s magnificent new anthem, Make A Joyful Noise. The couple then retire backstage to the Chapel of St Edward to remove their crowns for Holy Communion.",
        "Finally, they retire again and emerge in their Robes of Estate. Look for all the gold embroidered gardening imagery on the Queen\u2019s train.\u00a0Royal Kremlinologists will now be scanning the rear of the royal party for any signs of a rapprochement as the Duke of Sussex walks down the aisle before heading for home.1pm-2pmCoronation Procession time. The Gold State Coach, the gilded Georgian Cinderella-style monster, is at the Great West Door.The Waleses, their children and the other working members of the family climb into three carriages behind \u2014 minus the Princess Royal. She will be on her horse with the other Household Division colonels.",
        "Mary Tudor was the first woman to be crowned Queen in her own right.\u00a0She was accompanied into the Abbey on October 1, 1553, by her only living stepmother, Anne of Cleves, and her half-sister Elizabeth.\u00a0For her procession to the Abbey she wore a gown made out of gold and silver thread.\u00a0",
        "At the moment the King and Queen start moving, the front of the parade will already be at the top of The Mall.\u00a0With every unit of the three Services, every Commonwealth realm and almost every Commonwealth nation represented, this procession will be a collector\u2019s item.Made up of eight groups, it features no less than 19 bands. The coach is expected at Buckingham Palace at 1.45pm, at which point the King and Queen proceed through to the West Terrace overlooking the lawn.The entire parade, on reaching the Palace, will have formed up here for a royal salute.2pm-3pmThe King and Queen must make haste for the opposite side of the Palace and the mandatory East Front balcony appearance \u2014 still, we hope, in robes and crowns.\u00a0That wing of the Palace is still a building site so they will need to tread warily. Shortly before 2.30pm, expect to see the curtain flicker and the door open. Out will come the royal party. The royal anoraks will be scrutinising the line-up to see who makes an appearance.Finally \u2014 weather depending \u2014 it is the turn of the airborne arms of all three services, especially the RAF, led by three Juno helicopters and four more waves of rotary aircraft. Expect great excitement from the Wales children as Daddy\u2019s old colleagues come by.Next come the fixed-wing brigade led by the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight \u2014 the mighty Lancaster and a pair of Spitfires and Hurricanes.\u00a0The fastest come last followed, of course, by the Red Arrows and their red, white and blue smoke. A final crowning moment to a truly crowning day.Coronation order of service: Full list of hymns, music, prayers and readings revealed The Procession of The King and Queen",
        "Following the choir, religious and Commonwealth leaders, Their Majesties will enter Westminster Abbey to the anthem I Was Glad, a version of Psalm 122 set to music by Sir Hubert Parry, the composer of Jerusalem. Parry\u2019s setting contains the cry \u2018Vivat Rex!\u2019 (Long Live the King!) which will be proclaimed by scholars from Westminster School.A Moment of Silent PrayerThe Royal Couple take a moment to reflect and pay homage to God.Greeting and IntroductionThe Archbishop of Canterbury welcomes the congregation with a blessing.The RecognitionThis is the first element of the traditional English Coronation Rite in which the congregation affirms support for the King by exclaiming: \u2018God Save King Charles.\u2019The Presentation of the Holy BibleA copy of the Bible is gifted to the King, symbolically setting the \u2018word of God\u2019 above all human laws. The Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland will tell the King: \u2018Here is Wisdom; This is the royal Law; These are the lively Oracles of God.\u2019 This tradition dates back to the Coronation of William III and Mary II in 1689.The OathsThe Oaths are vows to support people of all faiths and beliefs. The Archbishop asks Charles III if he is willing to take the Oaths and to \u2018promise and swear to govern\u2019, to which the King will reply: \u2018I solemnly promise so to do.\u2019",
        "The King\u2019s PrayerThe Monarch offers a specially composed prayer which draws inspiration from Galatians 5 and the much-loved hymn, I Vow To Thee My Country.CollectAnother prayer, written especially for the Coronation, addressing the theme of loving service.The EpistleColossians 1 9:17Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will read from the first chapter of the Epistle (which translates as \u2018letter\u2019) to the Colossians.GospelLuke 4:16-21The Gospel \u2014 derived from the Greek for \u2018Good News\u2019 \u2014 is St Luke\u2019s account of Jesus at worship in the synagogue.SermonThis is an opportunity for The Archbishop to place the ceremony within a broader religious context, and explain how the themes of the celebration relate to both the public and the monarch.",
        "The AnointingAs The King prepares to be anointed upon the Coronation Chair, he removes the Robes of State \u2014 signifying his humility in front of God.The Archbishop will anoint The King on his hands, breast and head. This sacred part of the ceremony will be held behind a screen and is not broadcast on TV.Meanwhile, the choir sing Handel\u2019s anthem Zadok The Priest, which he composed for the Coronation of George II in 1727.It has been sung prior to the anointing of the sovereign at the coronation of every British monarch since then.The Presentation of RegaliaPeers from the House of Lords and senior Anglican bishops will present various symbols of royalty. Non-Christian peers will present regalia which does not bear explicit Christian motifs, affirming the different faiths that will serve under the King.The OrbA representation of Sovereign power, the Orb is placed in The King\u2019s palm.",
        "The RingSimilarly to rings exchanged during a marriage ceremony, the Coronation Ring is a symbol of the monarch\u2019s promise and commitment to God. The Archbishop will tell King Charles that the ring represents \u2018the covenant sworn on this day between God and King, King and people\u2019.",
        "The Sceptre and RodAnother piece of regalia loaded with significance, the Sceptre represents temporal power and authority. The Rod of Equity and Mercy represents the Monarch\u2019s spiritual role and his pastoral care of the people.",
        "The CrowningMade of solid gold and set with precious stones, St Edward\u2019s Crown (made in 1661) represents the King\u2019s vocation before God, and is a reminder of the promises and vows he has made to the people.As he crowns the King, the Archbishop will lead the congregation in declaring \u2018God Save the King!\u2019 \u2014 a loyal exclamation that has been part of the Coronation ritual since 1689.FanfareRichard Strauss\u2019s famous Vienna Philharmonic Fanfare will follow the crowning and then the Abbey bells will ring for two minutes, followed by a Gun Salute fired by The King\u2019s Troop Royal Horse Artillery as well as all Saluting Stations throughout the Kingdom, including in Bermuda, Gibraltar and on ships at sea.The BlessingThe Archbishop and other Christian leaders will deliver the blessing. It is the first time the Blessing has been shared by clergy from different denominations \u2014 a reflection of Britain\u2019s ecumenical progress.Enthroning The KingThe King is settled on the throne while the Archbishop commands him to \u2018stand firm, and hold fast from henceforth this seat of royal dignity, which is yours by the authority of Almighty God\u2019 \u2014 phrasing which dates back to the coronation of King Edgar in 959.HomageThe Church of England, followed by Prince William, pays homage to the King. This is then followed by a new tradition: the opportunity for the public to swear their \u2018true allegiance\u2019 to the Monarch and his heirs. A chorus of millions will participate \u2014 from members of the congregation and subjects in the streets outside to people up and down the country \u2014 in this solemn and joyful moment.Coronation of the QueenIn a shorter sequence to that of the King, Queen Camilla has her own Coronation, which begins with a brief anointing.The last sovereign consort to be crowned was the late Queen Mother in 1937. It is an honour that is bestowed only on female consorts, and therefore His Late Royal Highness Prince Philip had no such ceremony.The CrowningQueen Mary\u2019s Crown is placed upon her head. The crown has been embellished with jewels from her Late Majesty\u2019s personal collection, including the Cullinan III, IV and V diamonds.Enthroning The QueenCamilla is seated beside the King, symbolising their joint vocation before God. A significant moment of music comes next, as the choir will sing Andrew Lloyd Webber\u2019s coronation anthem, Make A Joyful Noise as the King and Queen are united in their joint vocation. This setting of verses from Psalm 98 was commissioned for this service.Offertory HymnGifts of bread and wine are brought before the King.Eucharistic PrayerThis prayer recalls the words of Jesus at the Last Supper.SanctusWith words dating to the fifth century, the Sanctus will be sung to music composed by Roxanna Panufnik, a British composer of Polish heritage, one of the King\u2019s 12 commissions for the Coronation.The Lord\u2019s PrayerThe Archbishop will invite everyone to join him in prayer, wherever they may be, in whichever language they wish. The Our Father was Jesus\u2019s gift to his followers when they asked how they should pray.",
        "Prayer after CommunionTaken from the Book Of Common Prayer, this prayer asks God to direct us in His holy ways.The Final BlessingThe Archbishop of Canterbury leads a final blessing, praying: \u2018Christ our King, make you faithful and strong to do his will, that you may reign with him in glory\u2019.Te DeumThis Latin hymn dates back to the 4th Century and is sometimes called The Hymn Of The Church. It is sung as Their Majesties go to St Edward\u2019s Chapel to be vested in the Robes of Estate and Charles puts on the Imperial State Crown.The term \u2018Imperial State Crown\u2019 dates back to the 15th century, when English monarchs chose a crown design closed by arches to demonstrate that England was not subject to any other earthly power.The National AnthemGod Save The King has been the national anthem for more than 250 years. It is both song and prayer, calling on God to protect the Sovereign and ensure their wise rule. The eponymous phrase is far older than the song, appearing several times in the King James Bible.Greeting of faith leaders, representatives and the governor -generalsIn an unprecedented gesture marking the significance of the religious diversity of the Realms, the Sovereign will spend his final moments in the Abbey receiving a greeting from the leaders and representatives from the major non-Christian faith traditions: Jewish, Hindu, Sikh, Muslim and Buddhist.In a historic first, the complete coronation will be recorded and released as an album on the very day of the ceremony.Bombed by suffragettes, covered in ancient graffiti... secrets of the 700-year-old Coronation chairBy Nigel Jones\u00a0For over seven centuries, it has been the chair on which history is made. Today, it will be so again.Made of oak, and with a lion at each of its feet, this high-backed seat of majesty, commissioned by King Edward I in 1296, is the most ancient artefact involved in King Charles III\u2019s Coronation: the Coronation Chair.King Edward\u2019s (or Saint Edward\u2019s) Chair, to give it its correct name (it was named in honour of the 11th century monarch Edward the Confessor), is the oldest piece of furniture in the United Kingdom still used for its original purpose. It\u2019s also the oldest we have a named craftsman for \u2014 the painter and carpenter Master Walter of Durham.Walter decorated the chair with gilding, stained glass, and decorations of foliage, animals and a king \u2014 believed to be either Edward I or Edward the Confessor. Today, these details have been all but lost.The intervening centuries have not always proved kind. \u2018It wouldn\u2019t look out of place in the Steptoes\u2019 junkyard,\u2019 commented a recent visitor to Westminster Abbey of the throne\u2019s appearance.",
        "The chair was originally commissioned by Edward I to house the Stone of Scone, also known as the Stone of Destiny, a highly significant spoil of his wars in Scotland. The stories of the throne and the stone have become so intertwined it is impossible to separate them.",
        "Final preparations are being made for a major transport operation ahead of hundreds of thousands of people descending on central London for the Coronation.Roadworks on major roads across England have been lifted and train services will be beefed up to cope with demand. People arriving in the capital tomorrow are being urged to consider walking to viewing areas as public transport will be very busy.Road closures will be enforced in large parts of central London, affecting motorists and bus users.National Highways has lifted more than 700 miles of roadworks on England's motorways and major A roads ahead of the weekend, meaning 96 per cent of its network is fully open. These include routes which will be used by thousands of people driving to London for the coronation.Eleven miles of roadworks were lifted on the M1 around Hemel Hempstead and Dunstable, and 12.5 miles of works were removed from the M11 around Cambridge and Harlow.The cones will not be put back until after Monday.Some train operators will run additional services and longer trains.Great Western Railway has added extra services to London Paddington from major stations in South Wales, south-west England and the Thames Valley area on Saturday morning.Southeastern will run additional trains between Dartford and London Charing Cross, and longer trains on the Maidstone East Line and between London Victoria and Gillingham.Govia Thameslink Railway - which operates Gatwick Express, Great Northern, Southern and Thameslink - said some of its services will have more carriages than normal.Transport for London (TfL) advised people to 'avoid driving in central London if you possibly can', and 'if you travel into London by national rail, consider walking to the viewing areas if you are able to'.It warned that safety measures on London Underground such as queuing, closures, trains not stopping or changes to the way people enter or leave stations 'are likely to be necessary, especially in central London' on Saturday.Some Tube stations are expected to be 'very busy', including Westminster, Green Park, Charing Cross, Embankment, Victoria, Hyde Park Corner, Knightsbridge, Leicester Square, Piccadilly Circus, Temple and Marble Arch.St James's Park station will be closed and Hyde Park Corner station will be exit-only until the crowds disperse.There are no planned London Underground closures or work affecting train services on lines serving the capital on Saturday.",
        "Before Edward got his rapacious royal hands on it, what looks like an ordinary rectangular block of sandstone had for centuries been used as the seat upon which kings of Scotland were crowned.The Stone of Destiny had been housed at Scone Abbey, in Perthshire, before Edward removed it during one of his campaigns and had it taken to London as a potent symbol of Scottish submission.It was, after all, his successful warring north of the border which won the King the epithet \u2018Hammer of the Scots\u2019. His tomb in Westminster Abbey bears that inscription in Latin.The first king whom historians are confident was crowned on the coronation chair is Edward I\u2019s great-great-grandson, Henry IV, in 1399.From then onwards, the coronations of English monarchs (and from 1603 that also meant Scottish monarchs, and since 1707 British monarchs) took place on the throne and the stone.\u00a0For two inanimate objects, they have had a lively and dramatic history.In the 1650s, during the short-lived republic that followed the English Civil War, throne and stone were taken to Westminster Hall where the military dictator Oliver Cromwell sat upon them for his installation as Lord Protector of England.Cromwell\u2019s is not the only common posterior to have rested upon the chair. Until the 1850s, members of the public were allowed to sit on it briefly, if they paid a few pence for the privilege.Over time it has suffered at the hands of initial-carving vandals, leading to regular restoration work.\u00a0In the 18th and 19th centuries, the chair suffered particularly badly from graffiti. One impudent visitor carved: \u2018P. Abbott slept in this chair 5-6 July 1800\u2019.After a thick brown varnish was added in 1887 for Queen Victoria\u2019s golden jubilee \u2014 wrecking the remaining gilding in the process \u2014 it\u2019s no wonder the great Gothic Revival architect Sir Giles Gilbert Scott described the chair early in the 20th century as \u2018mutilated\u2019.In June 1914, on the eve of World War I, militant suffragettes fighting for women\u2019s right to vote exploded a bomb in the Abbey.No one was injured, but it damaged a corner of a lion leg. In World War II, fears of a German invasion \u2014 or damage from the Blitz that was raining bombs on London \u2014 led to the chair being removed for safe keeping to the crypt of Gloucester Cathedral for the war\u2019s duration.The presence of the Stone of Destiny in Westminster Abbey was a source of contention for Scottish nationalists, and on Christmas Day 1950, four students from Glasgow University broke into the Abbey and retook the stone.\u00a0While struggling to get it out, they dropped it, breaking it in two.The students gave the two pieces to the Scottish Covenant Association, who were campaigning for a Scottish Parliament, and they had it repaired. Four months later, they handed it over to the police, who returned it to Westminster.There it remained until 1996, when, on the 700th anniversary of Edward seizing it, John Major\u2019s government returned the stone.\u00a0It is now on display in Edinburgh Castle along with the Scottish Crown Jewels.\u00a0Major returned the stone to its native land on one condition: that it would come back to Westminster whenever it was needed for a coronation.Today it takes its former place beneath the Coronation Chair as His Majesty Charles III prepares to sit where so many of his predecessors have sat before."
