        "Taylor Swift's ex Joe Alwyn will reportedly continue to benefit financially for years to come due to the songs that he co-wrote with the singer.\u00a0",
        "The actor, 32, used the\u00a0pseudonym William Bowery to help create the songs Betty and Exile on her album Folklore in 2020.He also contributed to Champagne Problems and Coney Island from Evermore and last year he co-wrote Sweet Nothing on her latest No1 album Midnights.Taylor, 33, split from Joe earlier this year and is now rumoured to have moved on with The 1975 star Matty Healy.\u00a0A source told The Sun: 'Joe will be raking in a fortune from these songs for years.",
        "'Taylor's albums sold millions and continue to be huge on streaming services.'He will easily be making a five-figure sum every year from his contributions. Writing six songs for albums as big as Taylor's guarantees a healthy income stream for life.'Representatives for both have been contacted by MailOnline comment.\u00a0On Sunday night Taylor was pictured for the first time with her rumored beau Matty\u00a0in photos exclusively obtained by DailyMail.com.The rumored couple were pictured arriving to Taylor's condo at 12:30AM on Sunday morning following her Eras concert in Nashville, Tennessee.They sat beside each other in the back of their chauffeured vehicle, where Matty, 34, was still wearing the same bracelet he sported earlier that evening while attending her concert\u00a0alongside members of Taylor's girl squad, Gigi Hadid and Lily Aldridge.",
        "The new romance comes less than a month after Taylor split from her boyfriend of six years, actor Joe.\u00a0Only last month, Taylor's inner circle - including her brother Austin, Gigi and the Haim sisters - reportedly unfollowed her now-ex Joe.",
        "Many Swifties \u2014 her loyal and eagle-eyed fans \u2014 claimed that some of the songwriter's besties reportedly broke ties on Instagram just shortly after being spotted hanging out with the star and perhaps learning what really happened.The bold moves on social media appeared to suggest that there may be more to the breakup than the public is aware of.Just after catching up over dinner with longtime friends Blake Lively and her husband Ryan Reynolds, for instance, the Deadpool actor allegedly immediately unfollowed Alwyn.The obvious snub was a shocking move considering Ryan had previously gushed about the British actor and their six-year-long friendship in a TIME100 Next article published in September 2022. (His wife does not currently follow Alwyn.)The latest sighting comes shortly after The Sun reported earlier Thursday that the rumored couple had plans to confirm the romance over the weekend during her Nashville stop.According to the outlet, Healy is slated to perform two of her popular songs, with a source stating, 'Taylor and Matty have been planning their 'coming out' for a few weeks now, and are really excited just to go public with their love.'",
        "The insider further revealed, 'Neither of them want any secrets, or to hide away. The plan is for Matty to walk out on stage mid-show and play two songs.''They will chat to the audience and, at present, the idea is for them to confirm their romance with some kind of PDA \u2014 public display of affection. It won't be anything remotely cheesy though.'And on Saturday, Matty strummed on his guitar as he made an appearance with Taylor's supporting act during the show. Whether he will hop onto the stage once again to perform with the Blank Space hitmaker has yet to seen.Taylor and Matty's rumored romance first came to light earlier this week on Wednesday, with a separate source telling The Sun, 'She and Matty are madly in love.''It's super-early days, but it feels right. They first dated, very briefly, almost ten years ago but timings just didn't work out,' the insider added.In regards to her ex, the source informed the publication, 'Taylor and Joe actually split up back in February, so there was absolutely no crossover.''Both Matty and Taylor have been touring over the past few weeks, so it's been a lot of Face-Timing and texting but she cannot wait to see him again,' and added that the two stars, 'are incredibly supportive of their respective careers.'",
        "'They are both massively proud and excited about this relationship and, unlike Taylor's last one \u2014 which was very much kept out of the spotlight, deliberately \u2014 she wants to 'own' this romance, and not hide it away.'While Taylor focuses on her Eras Tour, which is slated to conclude later this year in August, Matty is also in the middle of touring with his band, The 1975.Before making a surprise appearance to join the opening act, the Robbers musician was seen making a quick Starbucks run after reportedly spending time at Taylor's Nashville condo earlier Friday night.As the British-born singer exited the popular coffee shop chain on Saturday, he carried a warm drink in his hand while also looking through his smartphone as he was led by a security guard to a sleek, white SUV parked near the coffee shop.",
        "After grabbing a drink to get a boost of energy, Healy was later seen arriving at Nissan Stadium in the heart of Nashville ahead of Taylor's Saturday night performance in the city.Earlier on Friday, he was seen dancing along to Swift as she sang her hit track, Shake It Off, amongst fellow concert-goers in a secured area on the floor section of the venue.The video was posted on Twitter and quickly went viral amid rumors that Matty and Taylor have started a budding romance.",
        "Despite the speculation that the two have entered a relationship, both singers have yet to publicly confirm they are dating.\u00a0"
