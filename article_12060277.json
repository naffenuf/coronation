        "Irish deputy prime minister Micheal Martin has defended comments he made in relation to China, which the Chinese embassy criticised as misleading.",
        "Speaking during a keynote address to the Royal Irish Academy International Affairs Conference last week, Mr Martin spoke about the \u201cvalue\u201d of Ireland\u2019s relationship with China while also warning that it should be monitored.The Tanaiste told the conference \u2013 entitled \u2018Human (In)Security in an Unsettled World\u2019 \u2013 that Ireland must be \u201cclear-eyed\u201d about China\u2019s objectives, and said that Ireland\u2019s \u201cinterests and values differ\u201d from those of China.After highlighting common goals, Mr Martin said \u201cwe are not naive\u201d, and said the private sector and academia need to assess their relationship with China and areas where they may need to \u201cde-risk\u201d.He also said \u201cwe do not intend to be silent when we see evidence of core principles being undermined\u201d.While also issuing those warnings, the Tanaiste emphasised the 34.5 billion euro two-way trading relationship in 2021.",
        "He said Ireland\u2019s engagement with China on global issues increased during the pandemic years, largely due to Ireland\u2019s two-year tenure on the UN Security Council.\u201cWe were most successful in finding solutions when we were frank in our views \u2013 and clear with each other \u2013 about where we were willing to compromise, and where we were not,\u201d he said.The Chinese embassy in Ireland responded by acknowledging the positive comments, but criticised other parts of the address as \u201cover-exaggerated\u201d and \u201cmisleading\u201d.",
        "Responding to Mr Martin\u2019s calls that China has not acknowledged that Russia started the war, and his call for China to push for its end, the embassy said \u201cChina always stands on the side of peace\u201d.It also said that China would \u201cnot sit idly by, nor would it add oil to the fire, still less exploit the situation for self gains\u201d.Speaking to reporters in Cork on Monday, Mr Martin said that his speech was \u201ca very measured and balanced presentation\u201d.He said: \u201c\u2026in respect of our relationship with China and the relationship with the European Union and China into the future, to be clear-eyed about it, to be clear on the importance of maintaining strong economic, social and cultural ties with China, but also then to be in a position to look at everything through the prism of an international rules-based order which also involves raising and articulating issues pertaining to personal freedoms and human rights, also.\u201dMr Martin was also asked about the comments by the Russian embassy in response to the death of an Irishman in Ukraine.\u201cAgain, my own perspective on that at the time was there was a family mourning and a family grieving the loss of their son and I didn\u2019t want to say anything at that time to cause any additional trauma for the family,\u201d the Foreign Affairs minister said.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s terrible for them and I think the Russian ambassador in my view shouldn\u2019t have commented.\u201cI think, as we have said, his comments were a distortion, were unacceptable and in my view were not reflective of either my position or the country\u2019s position more generally.\u201dDespite those criticisms, Mr Martin downplayed the presence of four Russian ships in Irish waters last week.He said: \u201cI think this is ongoing in terms of over the years and indeed in more recent times, various vessels and ships from Russia indeed can enter into the Irish Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).\u201cIt\u2019s carefully monitored by Ireland and indeed by others, and that\u2019s an ongoing scenario where people track what\u2019s happening within international waters and indeed within the Irish Exclusive Economic Zone which is quite large in itself.\u201cSo I don\u2019t see it as a threat, it\u2019s something that we\u2019re conscious of and we keep a very close eye on.\u201d"
