        "Murray won 6-4 5-7 6-3 as the second round tie at the Open Aix Provence Credit Agricole turned into a marathon affair lasting two hours and 42 minutesThe 35-year-old three-time major champion \u2013 ranked 52 in the world and 135 places higher than Lokoli \u2013 shaded a tight first set on the French clay.It looked as if the fifth seed would make short work of the contest in the second set when he broke serve for a 5-2 lead.But Murray failed to take two match points and Lokoli, who was animated and waved his arms in the air to rev up the home crowd, battled back to make it 5-4.Another two match points came and went for Murray in the next game with Lokoli\u2019s drop shots proving a powerful weapon against the Scot.",
        "Lokoli soon took the second set with Murray unable to halt a five-game losing streak.Both players served impressively in the deciding set until Murray applied the pressure and seized a third break point to lead 5-3.Despite Lokoli producing a stunning forehand winner to save a fifth match point, Murray eventually wrapped up victory \u2013 much to his obvious relief.It was the first time he had secured back-to-back wins since Indian Wells in March.",
        "Having beaten Gael Monfils in the first round, Murray will face a third French player, Luca Van Assche, in the quarter-finals on Friday."
