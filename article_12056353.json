        "During Saturday's episode, the notoriously badly behaved character showcased his magic tricks - and covered the judge in pink gunge.After performing a card trick, Blobby pulled the show's head judge Simon, 63, up onto the stage, placing him into 'Mr Blobby's Disappearing Box'.Simon was seen taking a seat before Mr Blobby closed the door, with the crowd cheering.However, things took a turn for the worse for the music mogul, as when Mr Blobby was seen closing the door, pink slime poured out and deluged Simon.\u00a0",
        "Simon warned: 'Don't touch me! Get away from me!'As fellow judges Amanda Holden, 52, Alesha Dixon, 44, and Bruno Tonioli, 67 were left astonished - viewers made a guess on who the person behind the costume might be.'Mr Blobby was definitely David Walliams #BGT2023 #BritainsGotTalent,' one viewer wrote.Another one added: 'Is Mr Blobby David Walliams in disguise? #bgt #bgt2023 #BritainsGotTalent.'Another user wrote: 'Now take your Mr Blobby head off and reveal yourself David Walliams' #BGT.''That's so @davidwalliams in the Blobby costume. #BGT,' another fan said.",
