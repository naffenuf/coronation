        "May 17 (Reuters) - Some oil and gas companies in Canada's main crude-producing province Alberta were forced to re-curtail output as tinder-dry weather and shifting winds on Tuesday elevated the risk of spreading wildfires in the Canadian oil-producing province.",
        "At one point the fires pushed more than 30,000 people out of their homes while oil and gas producers shut in at least 319,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), or 3.7% of national production.Following are the latest from Canadian energy companies:** Pipestone Energy CorpThe Calgary-based energy company said that about 20,000 boepd of production has been temporarily curtailed since the evening of May 12.** Razor Energy CorpThe company said that it has shut its operated and non-operated production of about 2,500 boepd in Kaybob and Swan Hills areas.** Crescent Point Energy CorpThe company said it has shut-in its Kaybob Duvernay production due to the ongoing wildfires.A portion of this production was reactivated last week, however, Crescent Point is temporarily shutting back-in the remainder of its 45,000 boepd of production in the area as a precautionary measure.** Baytex Energy CorpBaytex said ongoing wildfires are impacting its operations in the Peace River and Peavine regions of northwest Alberta.About 20,000 boepd of production has been shut-in since the morning of May 13. In addition, in west-central Alberta, approximately 4,000 boepd remains shut-in since the evening of May 5 as a result of the shut-in of third-party infrastructure.** Obsidian Energy Ltd",
        "Obsidian said it took the Peace River area fields at Seal, Walrus and Nampa offline on May 12 and shut-in the Peace River Harmon Valley South field on May 14.The Harmon Valley South field was being restarted. The company added that about 1,200 boepd of production in Peace River would remain temporarily curtailed until the remaining wildfire threat had subsided.** Athabasca Oil CorpThe company said it had shut-in two of its facilities at Kaybob and added it estimated about 2,300 boepd of temporary production downtime.** Cenovus Energy IncCenovus said about 85,000 boepd of production, primarily dry gas, had been impacted in the company's Rainbow Lake, Kaybob-Edson, Elmworth-Wapiti and Clearwater operating areas.** Paramount Resources LtdParamount said a third-party gas processing plant and some Paramount fields were shut due to the fires, and it had curtailed 45,000 boepd.** NuVista Energy LtdThe company said it had temporarily shut in and depressured all operations proximal to the ongoing fires in the Grande Prairie region. The temporary production impact is about 40,000 boepd.** Vermilion Energy IncVermilion said it had restored about 60% of the 30,000 boepd of production that was temporarily shut-in.As a result of production being offline, the Canadian energy producer expects second-quarter production to average 80,000 boepd to 83,000 boepd, compared with a previous forecast of 84,000 boepd to 86,000 boepd.",
