        "'Literally one minute later' the mum came back to Mikaela and berated her.'I'm going to be honest you've been on this machine for like forever now, I've been waiting,' the woman said before Mikaela assured her she wouldn't be much longer.\u00a0'It's just really annoying because I pay for a membership here and I've been waiting like the whole time I've been here,' the mum complained before calling Mikaela's actions 'annoying'.\u00a0'I don't have a tonne of time, I have kids at home. I just need to hop on this machine and get it done. Can you please just get off so I can have it?'",

Karen can take her misplaced anger somewhere else,' a second chimed in.''I'm about to go to the front desk' okay, they are gonna tell you to wait your turn,' a third pointed out.\u00a0Some said the 'entitled' mum could have used other equipment instead of the shoulder press.\u00a0\u00a0'She could use free weights and get her shoulder presses in\u2026 like I would never!' one gym junkie wrote.\u00a0'LMFAO like girl go on a different machine for God sakes. So embarrassing for her to act like that,' a second replied.\u00a0Others praised Mikaela for being polite to the 'rude' mum and joked they would refuse to let her on the machine.\u00a0\u00a0'I would have shoulders of steel because I would not move off that machine until she left that gym,' someone quipped.\u00a0\u00a0'I wouldn't get off that damn machine if my life depended on it after that,' a second agreed.\u00a0",
        "'WHY were you so nice to her?!?! I literally would've gone off,' a third asked.\u00a0\u00a0"
