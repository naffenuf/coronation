        "A well-traveled pass rusher who entered the NFL as an undrafted free agent from Miami in 2018, Harris had 15 career sacks with the Hurricanes and landed with the New England Patriots, sticking on the practice squad as a rookie. Harris helped play the role of Aaron Donald for the Patriots ahead of their Super Bowl LIII win over the Los Angeles Rams.An outside linebacker for the Houston Roughnecks, Harris had 7.0 sacks to lead the XFL in 2023, including four in Week 1.The Broncos were 5-12 last season and their top two sack leaders, Dre'Mont Jones (6.5) and Bradley Chubb (5.5), are no longer on the roster. Denver posted just 36 total sacks in 2022 after recording 17 in the first five games of the regular season. Chubb was traded to the Miami Dolphins in October.Harris has 2.0 career sacks and 34 tackles in the NFL.He was claimed off waivers by the Miami Dolphins in September 2019 and spent parts of 2020 and 2021 with the New York Giants before unfruitful cameos with the Ravens and Raiders in 2022.--Field Level Media"
