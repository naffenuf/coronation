        "Tiny room put up for rent for in Sydney CBDDesperate renters struggling to find homes\u00a0Australia's housing crisis has reached new lows, with a windowless closet that can barely fit a single bed being advertised for a staggering $300 rent a week.",
        "A picture of the room listing shared to social media Tuesday advertises it as being inside a penthouse in the Sydney CBD and shows the narrow room with a single bed inside touching three of the four walls.While the listing, which was taken down by Wednesday morning, says the price is $300-a-month, the Aussie who shared it said they had spoken with the person who posted the ad, and it was really: '$300-a-week to sleep in a CBD apartment pantry room'.Rents have been spiking all over Australia as low housing supply and flow-on effects from 11 consecutive mortgage rate rises combine with borders re-opening and waves of foreign workers and students returning.Between March 2022 and March 2023, the median unit rent jumped 24 per cent in Sydney, equivalent to an extra $120-a-week, according to the Domain Rent Report.",
        "Melbourne rose by nearly as much, surging by 23.1 per cent, while Brisbane rents rose by 16.3 per cent.Adelaide and Perth rents grew by 13.5 per cent and 12.5 per cent respectively and Darwin and Hobart grew by about 6 per cent each.Commenters were seething at the 'audacity' of the landlord and questioned whether it was a fire hazard.'This is a cupboard not a bedroom,' one person wrote.",
        "'Is the travel time really worth being squished into a tiny space?' another wrote.'This is how far Sydney has fallen,' a third added.Another said the room wasn't unusual lately, pointing to a recent AirBnB listing they found in which a person had setup a 'apartment' within their loungeroom.The 'private' room was sectioned off from the rest of the loungeroom with blankets and doonas and features a single bed on the floor.It is available to rent for a minimum of four-nights at a cost of more than $300.",
        "The Community Housing Industry Association NSW (CHIA) says the only way to correct the escalating crisis is for the government to urgently invest in social and affordable housing.'This is not the sort of record anyone in Australia wants to break,' CEO Mark Degotardi said on Wednesday.'It is yet more proof that renters in NSW and across the country are at crisis point.'The housing emergency is growing more and more dire.'Landlords would pass on the the cost of Tuesday's interest rate rise to tenants, he said.'And the vacancy rate in NSW is also at a record low, so we can expect rents to climb even further.'The Real Estate Institute of NSW is calling for an 'immediate and expeditious inquiry'.",
        "It says the government and industry need to work together to build thousands of homes to prevent a housing catastrophe.",
        "CEO Tim McKibbin says the disparity between demand and supply is set to worsen, putting unprecedented pressure on a housing market already unable to cope.'It's time for action and this means government and industry working together now,' he said.The NSW Greens and their federal counterparts continue calling for a rent freeze, closing loopholes which allow bidding wars between prospective tenants.The NSW government has said it is committed to banning no-grounds evictions and secret rental bidding, meaning real estate agents have to disclose when prospective tenants up their bids at rental property inspections.The state government will also install a rental commissioner to advocate for tenants and a portable bond scheme allowing renters to transfer their bonds from one property to another.Federal Housing Minister Julie Collins will meet her state and territory counterparts in Canberra on Wednesday, where they will discuss pathways to strengthening renters' rights."
