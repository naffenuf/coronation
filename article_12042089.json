        "Rishi Sunak thinks it is \u201cobviously disappointing\u201d that partygate investigator Sue Gray chose not to engage with a Government process looking into her move to a senior Labour role, Downing Street has said.",
        "But Labour has defended the former senior official for not co-operating with the \u201cpolitical gimmick\u201d review and prioritising the \u201cstandard\u201d process carried out by Whitehall\u2019s anti-corruption watchdog.It came after the Cabinet Office on Tuesday released an update on Ms Gray\u2019s departure from her high-ranking Whitehall position, which, contrary to briefing to the press, did not say that she had broken rules by speaking to the opposition while still working for the Government.Instead, Cabinet Office minister Oliver Dowden said the Government would \u201cconsider next steps\u201d after she \u201cchose not to\u201d engage. It is obviously disappointing that Sue Gray was offered to co-operate and has chosen not to do so  PM's press secretary  He said the Government had submitted a \u201cconfidential assessment\u201d to the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba).The independent watchdog will recommend a cooling-off period between three months and two years to avoid any conflict of interest once it concludes its own separate review.News in March that Ms Gray was leaving her senior Civil Service role with plans to become Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s chief of staff sparked anger among Tory MPs.Sky News reported that the Labour leader first contacted her about the position in October, at least four months before her appointment was announced.",
        "Sir Keir has repeatedly refused to disclose the timeline of their communications. Asked about Sky\u2019s claim, Labour said: \u201cAll the information has gone to Acoba and not going to comment during an active process.\u201dThe Times reported that Ms Gray had questioned the standing of the Cabinet Office probe into her departure and the rules by which it was to be conducted.The Prime Minister\u2019s press secretary said she did not \u201crecognise\u201d reports that the former mandarin declined to engage with the internal inquiry because it was on shaky legal ground, and that this may have contributed to Cabinet Secretary Simon Case blocking plans to release a fuller assessment on her job move.",
        "She told reporters in Westminster on Wednesday: \u201cThe Prime Minister is not obviously involved in this process. But it is obviously disappointing that Sue Gray was offered to co-operate and has chosen not to do so.\u201cI think what is more disappointing is that Keir Starmer is in a position where he could clear up very quickly when contact was made by his office or by him to Sue Gray to uphold the integrity of the Civil Service and ensure that it is transparent and open.\u201dSir Keir\u2019s spokesman stressed that Labour is \u201cfully supporting\u201d the anti-corruption watchdog\u2019s deliberations on Ms Gray\u2019s job move.",
        "Earlier, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves described the internal inquiry as a \u201cpolitical gimmick\u201d launched by the Government to pursue a \u201cvendetta\u201d against the ex-civil servant who had looked into allegations of parties in Downing Street during pandemic lockdowns.The Labour frontbencher told Times Radio: \u201cThe issue here is that there are two inquiries going on. There\u2019s the usual one \u2013 the Acoba process, which Sue Gray is co-operating with fully \u2013 and then there\u2019s the political gimmick one set up by Government ministers to pursue this vendetta they\u2019ve got against Sue Gray.\u201d",
        "Asked about the revenge claim, Mr Sunak\u2019s press secretary said: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think that is the case at all.\u201dSir Keir has insisted he was \u201cconfident\u201d Ms Gray had not broken any rules.The Labour leader said he \u201chad no discussions with her while she was investigating Boris Johnson whatsoever, I don\u2019t think anyone is suggesting that\u2019s the case\u201d.The Prime Minister\u2019s official spokesman declined to comment on reports that Cabinet Secretary Mr Case, who initially backed the release of findings critical of Ms Gray\u2019s departure, blocked the plans amid concerns over publishing a politically charged report into a former official just days before the local elections when the Government is meant to observe \u201cpurdah\u201d rules on political impartiality.",
        "\u201cI\u2019m not going to get into speculation along those lines,\u201d the PM\u2019s spokesman told reporters."
