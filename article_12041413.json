        "Leeds have sacked manager Javi Gracia and appointed Sam Allardyce to take charge for the rest of the season as they bid to avoid relegation from the Premier League.",
        "Having already removed director of football Victor Orta, the Yorkshire club announced the departure of Spaniard Gracia on Wednesday morning along with his backroom staff.A poor season at Elland Road sees the club languishing in 17th, and only goal difference keeps them out of the relegation zone.Leeds have lost four in a winless run of five matches and have four games left to save themselves.A club statement read: \u201cLeeds can confirm Javi Gracia will leave the club after 12 games in charge.\u201cZigor Aranalde, Mikel Antia and Juan Solla, who joined alongside Gracia, will also leave the club.\u201cWe thank Javi and his team for their efforts under difficult circumstances.\u201cThe remaining four games of the season will be overseen by experienced head coach Sam Allardyce.\u201dFormer MK Dons, Charlton and Oxford boss Karl Robinson will be Allardyce\u2019s assistant.",
        "Leeds travel to leaders Manchester City on Saturday, before hosting third-placed Newcastle. A trip to West Ham and an Elland Road encounter with European hopefuls Tottenham round out the season.Allardyce takes charge after suffering his first Premier League relegation with West Brom, when he left six months into an 18-month contract.The 68-year-old former Bolton, Newcastle, West Ham and England boss becomes Leeds\u2019 third permanent manager of the season after Jesse Marsch and Gracia.",
        "Allardyce is reported to have agreed a basic salary of \u00a3500,000 for his four games in charge, with a \u00a32.5million bonus if he can keep Leeds up.Gracia, who replaced Marsch in February, collected 10 points from his first six games in charge, but a dreadful run of results in April left Leeds in a downward spiral.The clubs have lost five of their last seven games, with Sunday\u2019s 4-1 reverse at Bournemouth following 4-1, 5-1 and 6-1 defeats to Arsenal, Crystal Palace and Liverpool respectively earlier last month.",
        "The 23 goals Leeds conceded during April is a Premier League record for a single month.On Sunday, fans\u2019 group the Leeds United Supporters Advisory Board issued a vote of no confidence in both the club\u2019s board and Gracia.The players subsequently issued a statement on Monday apologising for their performance at Bournemouth and for failing to acknowledge fans at the team hotel."
