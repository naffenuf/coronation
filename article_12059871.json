        "Interim Walsall boss Mat Sadler believes he is ready for the job full-time after the Saddlers handed him his first win in management with a final-day 2-1 victory over Doncaster.",
        "Goals from Conor Wilkinson and Isaac Hutchinson earned Sadler his maiden triumph at the third attempt after last month\u2019s sacking of Michael Flynn.Sadler has been a coach at the club for the past four years under four different managers and confirmed he was interested in succeeding the Welshman.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of conversations going on in the next week \u2013 for me it was just important that we won and finished the season well,\u201d the 38-year-old said.\u201cBut the club has to get this next appointment really right, they are going to be doing a lot of due diligence, a lot of hard work over the next five to seven days in getting the right person in charge.\u201cThe owners are desperate for success and they are not going anywhere until they\u2019ve got it.",
        "\u201cThat\u2019s what is most important for me. I think I\u2019ll have a conversation about it. I\u2019ve thoroughly enjoyed the last two to three weeks, I\u2019ve enjoyed every aspect of it.\u201cI know football and I enjoy working with people and I think they are the two biggest things that football management is all about. No qualms on that.\u201dVictory over Doncaster ended a nine-game winless run and meant Walsall finished 16th in League Two.\u201cIn the first 20 minutes we could have scored two or three goals and that wouldn\u2019t have flattered us at all,\u201d Sadler added.",
        "\u201cThe players have been absolutely fantastic for me, through every minute of the last 270 minutes\u2019 worth of football, and I\u2019m delighted we got that win today which was thoroughly deserved.\u201dDoncaster, meanwhile, finished 18th after an 11th defeat in 16 matches, despite Bobby Faulkner\u2019s half-volley pulling one back late on.But keeper Louis Jones had kept them in the game with several fine stops and boss Danny Schofield said: \u201cThere was not a great deal in the game and certain moments went Walsall\u2019s way today.\u201cFinishing 18th is really disappointing. We want to finish up as high as possible. The aim is always play-offs and it\u2019s not materialised.\u201cWe were in and around that up until the end of February and really fell off it in March and April which is not good enough.\u201cWe need to make sure we reflect and have discussions with everyone at the club and see where we go taking the club forward.\u201cIt is an accumulation of things. We\u2019ve been competitive in a lot of the games and moments and haven\u2019t gone for us. You lose a bit of confidence. In certain moments in games, we have fell short collectively.\u201d"
