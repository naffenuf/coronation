We (picked this spot) because there are no trees so you can see the Red Arrows.\u201dOther soldiers were spotted parading in Parliament Square and practised changing position as Big Ben chimed.Artillery regiments rehearsed moving cannons on horseback and soldiers were seen pretending to fire the ceremonial weapons.",
