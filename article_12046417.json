        "LONDON, May 4 (Reuters) - The flow of new money into European funds marketed as very sustainable slowed to a record low in the first three months of 2023, as regulatory confusion prompted asset managers to be more cautious about their claims, Morningstar said on Thursday.",
        "The data provider said a European Commission clarification in April that there would not be minimum requirements for sustainable investments should halt the slowdown, and eventually see managers market funds again under the EU's top sustainability classification.The EU's Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), a key plank in its efforts to reach a net zero economy, came into force in 2021 and aims to tackle misleading claims from asset managers over their sustainability efforts.But many managers have been uncertain about what qualifies as a 'sustainable investment' and the confusion encouraged them to downgrade funds to a lower category requiring sustainability to be only one of the factors informing investment decisions.In its latest report on the industry, Morningstar said so-called Article 9 top-sustainability rated funds attracted 4 billion euro ($4.42 billion) of inflows between January and March, the lowest since SFDR came into force in 2021.By contrast, lower rated Article 8 funds amassed more than 25 billion euros of net new money, double the previous quarter amid a revival in broader demand for environmental, social and governance (ESG)-friendly funds.Critics say confusion around SFDR has made it harder for investors to pick genuinely environmentally friendly funds.Hortense Bioy, Morningstar's Global Director of Sustainability Research, said investors should brace for further reclassifications after the European Commission's clarification.",
        "\"In this context and given the flexibility afforded to asset managers in assessing the proportion of sustainable investments in their products, investors should remain prudent and do proper due diligence,\" she said.Morningstar said total assets in Articles 8 and 9 in the first quarter reached 4.9 trillion euros, giving them a record 57% market share.
