        "ORTONA, Italy (AP) - Pre-race favorite Remco Evenepoel stormed to victory in the opening time trial of the Giro d\u00b4Italia on Saturday.",
        "The world champion will hope to still be wearing the pink jersey when the Giro finishes in Rome on May 28.An impressive ride from Evenepeol saw him obliterate his main rivals over the 19.6-kilometer (12-mile) route from Fossacesia Marina to Ortona in 21 minutes, 18 seconds.The Soudal Quick-Step rider was 22 seconds faster than Filippo Ganna and 29 ahead of Jo\u00e3o Almeida.\"Super happy. It\u00b4s the best result we can get for the first day,\" Evenepoel said. \"I said I needed a time of 21'30\" to win and I did 21'18\" so I was quite close to my guess.\"I felt from the start that I had a good rhythm, always the same gear, the same cadence, so I think I\u00b4m just super happy with what I can do.\"",
        "Primoz Roglic, who is considered Evenepoel\u00b4s strongest challenger, endured an early blow as he finished 43 seconds behind the Belgian.\"It was hard but now it\u00b4s behind, so happy,\" Roglic said. \"I felt good, I\u00b4m super happy, optimistic for the upcoming days.\"For me, it was just to do my best. I did, I\u00b4m happy, 20 stages to go eh?\"Evenepoel had a 20-second advantage by the halfway point, while Roglic was already 26 seconds slower than him.\"I wasn\u00b4t really focusing on the gap with him, I just wanted to go and try and win the stage and in the end we won it so mission one accomplished,\" Evenepoel said.",
        "\"Now full focus, try to get safe through this first week and save as much energy for the next time trial.\"Sunday\u00b4s second stage is a 202-kilometer route from Teramo to San Salvo.___More AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"
