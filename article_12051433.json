        "Steven Naismith is hopeful that the improvement Josh Ginnelly has enjoyed at Hearts will help persuade the attacker to commit his future to the club.",
        "The former Burnley, Walsall and Preston player \u2013 approaching the end of his third campaign with the Jambos \u2013 has emerged as a key man this term and is the Edinburgh side\u2019s second-highest scorer with 11 goals to his name.Ginnelly is out of contract at the end of the season and supporters are eager to see the club tie down the 26-year-old Englishman to a new deal.\u201cI\u2019m not sure whether he will stay or go,\u201d said interim manager Naismith when asked for an update. \u201cI think the club will want to keep him. He\u2019s had the most consistent season since he\u2019s been at the club.\u201cThe years he has been here, he has progressed from being a new guy in with good attributes, to building his consistency and then becoming a more experienced character in the group. All these factors have been good for him and for the club.\u201cIn his previous moves, he\u2019s signed on thinking one thing and very quickly it\u2019s developed into something else which has not been great for him and he\u2019s not played his best stuff, hence why he came up to Hearts.",
        "\u201cI think this period of his career has probably been the most enjoyable. The club I\u2019m sure are trying to keep him, and Gino\u2019s got a decision to make.\u201d",
        "Naismith was handed the reins until the end of the season following the sacking of Robbie Neilson last month as Hearts search for a new permanent manager.Asked if he had any input into which of the out-of-contract players the club will attempt to retain, the 36-year-old said: \u201cI make recommendations and stuff like that but at the same time those players could have been speaking to clubs since January.\u201cIt\u2019s been made clear that with the players out of contract, it will be towards the end of the season that things are confirmed one way or the other.\u201dNaismith has been helping plan a pre-season even though it remains unclear whether he will be part of the new managerial set-up.\u201cIn terms of pre-season, there needs to be a programme there,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether I\u2019m the manager or somebody else is the manager, if we get to the summer and we don\u2019t have that, we\u2019re in big trouble because you\u2019re not going to get a pre-season trip or schedule as you want it.\u201cAs much as we can, we\u2019ve made the decisions, no matter which manager is in place.\u201dHearts, who are trying to chase down Aberdeen in the battle for third place in the cinch Premiership, host Celtic this Sunday and Naismith is hoping his team are able to prevent Ange Postecoglou\u2019s rampant side settling into their rhythm early on.",
        "\u201cThat\u2019s been consistent with Celtic since the manager came in, that he wants to start really fast and get ahead early in the game, which gives them a lot of control,\u201d said Naismith. \u201cThat\u2019s a threat we need to come up against and be brave enough to keep the ball and cause them as many problems as they cause us.\u201cIf we start fast and get the crowd something to back, then they\u2019ll back it and it will be a great atmosphere. Every game at home, that\u2019s what we need to do to get ourselves the backing of the fans which then gives us more confidence on the pitch.\u201cWe did it well against Ross County and hopefully we can do it again on Sunday.\u201d"
