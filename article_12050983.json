        "The King has taken part in a final coronation rehearsal on the eve of his historic day.",
        "Charles was spotted being driven away from Westminster Abbey where a 2,300-strong coronation congregation, and a television audience likely to be in the tens of millions, will watch him being crowned on Saturday.The final preparations come as broadcaster Jonathan Dimbleby, a friend of Charles who wrote his authorised biography, said the monarch would find the Homage of the People \u201cabhorrent\u201d.",
        "For the first time, those watching the coronation ceremony will be invited to make their own homage to Charles, replacing the traditional homage of peers, but some commentators have criticised the new element as divisive.Mr Dimbleby told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cI can think of nothing that he would find more abhorrent.\u201cHe\u2019s never wanted to be revered, he\u2019s never wanted \u2013 so as far as I know \u2013 to have anyone pay homage to him except in mock terms as a joke.\u201cHe wants, I think, to feel that people will share in the event and I don\u2019t quite know how this might have happened.\u201dThe King has a busy day with a series of diplomatic duties and has been joined by working royals at a special lunch for realm prime ministers and governors general at Buckingham Palace.",
        "Charles, who is head of the Commonwealth, will also attend a Commonwealth Heads of Government leaders\u2019 meeting and garden reception at London\u2019s Marlborough House the same day.",
        "Also on the eve of the coronation, the King and the royal family will host a glittering reception for foreign royalty and other overseas dignitaries at the Palace.Those travelling across the UK on public transport are being reminded to \u201cmind the gap\u201d by the King.Charles and Camilla have recorded an announcement which is being played between Friday and Monday at every railway station across the UK and all London Underground stations, industry body the Rail Delivery Group said.In the message, the King begins by telling passengers: \u201cMy wife and I wish you and your families a wonderful coronation weekend.\u201dCamilla then says: \u201cWherever you are travelling, we hope you have a safe and pleasant journey.\u201dThe message concludes with Charles adding: \u201cAnd remember, please mind the gap.\u201dIt was recorded at Highgrove earlier this year by the audio team from Transport for London."
