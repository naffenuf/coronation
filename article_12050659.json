        "The Scottish Police Federation (SPF) said it has been \u201cinundated with complaints\u201d over a new policy from Police Scotland that will require officers to be clean-shaven in order to wear protective masks.",
        "Speaking to BBC Radio Scotland\u2019s Good Morning Scotland programme on Friday, SPF general secretary David Kennedy said the plan has caused \u201cconsiderable angst\u201d among officers, adding he has \u201cnever seen so many complaints come in\u201d during his time as a full-time official.Police Scotland said the policy is being brought in to \u201cprotect those on the frontline\u201d as wearing the FFP3 mask properly requires the face to be clean-shaven.Mr Kennedy said the SPF, which represents rank-and-file officers, does not believe police would have to wear the masks often, which is the \u201croot of the problem\u201d which is \u201ccausing the angst for several police officers\u201d. Some officers may have to shave twice a day for these masks to work  David Kennedy, Scottish Police Federation  He added: \u201cThe health and safety executive guidance is that a policy like this should only be utilised as a last resort and there have been relevant questions raised by officers as to why this policy is now being proposed.\u201dPolice Scotland said there will be exemptions to the clean-shaven rule on religious or medical grounds, but Mr Kennedy claimed no equality or human rights assessment has been carried out on the policy.He said: \u201cPeople would be facing misconduct if they didn\u2019t shave. Some officers may have to shave twice a day for these masks to work.\u201d",
        "He said there has been no consultation on the policy as yet, and he believes Police Scotland will impose it.Mr Kennedy added he hopes the force will revisit the policy, arguing there are \u201cother health and safety issues\u201d it should be focusing on.Police Scotland said the policy will come into force in the next few weeks.",
        "Assistant Chief Constable Alan Speirs said: \u201cThe safety of our officers and staff is a priority and the policy around the use of respiratory equipment (RPE) is being implemented to protect those on the frontline.\u201cSignificant learning from the Covid pandemic identified that the FFP3 mask \u2013 which is face-fitted and requires users to be clean-shaven \u2013 offers the most appropriate and effective respiratory protection to officers and staff.\u201cWhile the risk from coronavirus has lowered, wider risks remain to those attending calls, such as fires, road accidents and chemical incidents which require PPE to be worn.\u201cThe respiratory protective equipment policy mandates that, where it can be reasonably foreseen that an officer or member of staff will use an FFP3 mask in the course of their duties, they should be clean-shaven.\u201cThe exception to this policy covers officers and staff who cannot shave for religious, cultural, disability or medical reasons. In these circumstances, Police Scotland is seeking to introduce an alternative type of respiratory protection.\u201d",
        "Later on Friday, the force said it would carry out a full consultation on the policy.Mr Speirs added: \u201cWe understand the frustrations among those affected on the frontline, but the use of RPE is absolutely necessary to protect officers and staff from serious health risks.\u201cWe are listening to a wide range of views on this matter and will undertake full consultation with all relevant staff associations ahead of implementation.\u201cA full human rights impact assessment is also being carried out as part of this process.\u201d"
