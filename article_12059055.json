        "The start of the new rulemaking process is set to be announced on MondayDemocrats have been pushing to require airlines to improve customer service\u00a0The Biden administration is working on new regulations that would require airlines to compensate passengers and cover their meals and hotel rooms if they are stranded for reasons within the company's control.",
        "The aim of the rules would be, for the first time, to require airlines to pay compensation beyond a ticket refund and to cover expenses that consumers incur, including rebooking on another flight, if the airline causes a cancellation or significant delay.The White House said President Joe Biden and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg would announce the start of the rulemaking process on Monday.The rulemaking pledge continues a push by the Democratic administration to require airlines\u00a0to improve customer service, and it comes just weeks before the start of the peak summer travel season.'When an airline causes a flight cancellation or delay, passengers should not foot the bill,' Buttigieg said in a statement.",
        "Currently, when an airline cancels a flight for any reason, consumers can demand a refund of the unused part of their ticket and certain extras that they might have paid to the airline, such as fees for checking a bag or getting a seat assignment. Airlines often try to persuade consumers to accept a travel voucher instead of a refund.After widespread flight disruptions last summer, the Transportation Department posted an online dashboard that was designed to pressure the airlines to improve customer service. The site lets consumers check each airline's policy on refunds and compensation when flights are canceled or delayed.",
        "Each of the 10 largest US airlines quickly promised to provide cash or vouchers for meals when a cancellation forces passengers to wait at least three hours for another flight. Nine of the 10 - all but Frontier Airlines - also promised to pay for accommodations for passengers stranded overnight.Questions arose again around reimbursing consumers for out-of-pocket costs after Southwest Airlines canceled nearly 17,000 flights during a December meltdown in service.\u00a0Desperate passengers were forced to sleep in terminals surrounded by growing mounds of lost luggage after being stranded at airports when the airline canceled more than 80 per cent of its flight schedule, causing President Biden to weigh in.",
        "Distressed travelers, some of whom were not be able to return home for nearly a week, bemoaned the frantic scenes in airport terminals as Biden's Administration vowed to 'ensure airlines are held accountable' for the disarray caused by Southwest.\u00a0The Transportation and Justice departments are investigating whether Southwest scheduled more flights than it realistically could handle.\u00a0The Transportation Department says it is working with the airlines to reduce cancellations and delays this summer, when air travel could exceed pre-coronavirus pandemic records.A report last month from the congressional Government Accountability Office blamed airlines for many cancellations, but the Federal Aviation Administration has also created disruptions due to technology outages and staffing shortages.\u00a0",
        "The FAA recently encouraged airlines to reduce flights to and from major New York airports this summer because it doesn't have enough air traffic controllers at a key facility."
