        "Peter Haring is hoping Hearts can spoil Celtic\u2019s cinch Premiership title party on Sunday.",
        "A victory at Tynecastle \u2013 or a Rangers slip-up at home to Aberdeen \u2013 will ensure the Hoops secure the trophy for the second year running, but the Jambos\u2019 Austrian midfielder is determined to prevent that scenario.\u201cAs a player you don\u2019t really think too much about that but obviously we want to try and stop that,\u201d said Haring.\u201cFirst and foremost, we want to win and get three points but no-one wants to have another club celebrating anything at Tynecastle. We hope we can avoid that.\u201cIt\u2019s always a great game against Celtic, especially at home. At home we\u2019ve got a chance against anybody in this league. We haven\u2019t beaten them this season yet but it\u2019s about time. We have to be confident and full of energy.\u201dHaring has played in two victories over Celtic since joining Hearts in the summer of 2018 and has featured\u00a0 in several close matches between the teams.",
        "\u201cEvery win is different and some taste sweeter than others but obviously beating Celtic, who have been by far the best team in Scotland since I got here, always feels really good,\u201d he said.\u201cYou need to be defensively very solid and disciplined. That\u2019s key. You need to try and play the game in the opposition half because when they dominate possession, the pressure increases and it gets harder.",
        "\u201cThey\u2019re very good at moving the ball quickly so once they\u2019ve pinned you back, it\u2019s really hard to get control of the game again. We\u2019ve worked on a gameplan and everyone needs to be ready. Energy and belief in yourself are the two main things.\u201dHaring, who recently returned to action following almost six months out with concussion issues, is due to run out of contract this summer.\u201cI hope so,\u201d the 29-year-old said, when asked if he expects to be at Hearts next term. \u201cThe full focus is on the next five games and then we\u2019ll see what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d"
