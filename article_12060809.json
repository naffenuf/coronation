        "Letecia Stauch was found guilty on Monday of murder in the first degree, guilty of murder of a child under 12, guilty of tampering with a deceased human body and guilty of tampering with physical evidence in the death of 11-year-old Gannon.Stauch, who worked as an elementary school teacher for special needs children,\u00a0will be sentenced later on Monday afternoon.\u00a0Prosecutors say she killed Gannon because she was resentful about being used as a glorified babysitter. She Googled the phrase 'I hate my stepson.'\u00a0",
        "Stauch stabbed Gannon 18 times before beating him across the head four times and shooting him in the jaw in January 2020, 'obliterating' the young boy's skull, according to prosecutors.\u00a0She killed Gannon while they lived in El Paso County, in the youngster's bedroom.\u00a0Stauch then hid his remains in a remote area nearby, and later rented a van to drive the little boy's body to Florida, where she dumped it under a bridge in Pensacola.It wasn't found until March, around three months after he vanished.\u00a0\u00a0The killer stepmom had tried to blame mental illness on her behavior, with her defense attorneys claiming she'd suffered a 'psychotic crack.'",
        "Her attorneys claimed it was the result of sexual abuse she'd suffered as a child.\u00a0\u00a0But prosecutors said the extent of Gannon's injuries showed that she acted with intent, and that she was mentally-competent when she killed him.\u00a0",
        "Prosecutor Dave Young told the court: 'What does that tell you? Use your common sense. It\u2019s not psychotic. It\u2019s just strategic.'Distressingly Gannon tried to fight off his killer stepmom despite being drugged with hydrocodone, prosecutors say.\u00a0Stauch is said to have wanted to end her marriage to Gannon's father, Al.\u00a0Prosecutors say a photo she snapped of Gannon laying in his bed on the morning of his murder was further evidence of the fact she'd pre-meditated the plot.",
        "She texted it to Al, who was away serving with the National Guard at the time.\u00a0\u00a0They say she used it to try and cover her tracks, by claiming she'd left Gannon in bed to go for a hike, only to come home to find he'd vanished.\u00a0After killing Gannon, Stauch scrubbed the walls and floors of his bedroom, then put her bloody shoes and clothes in the washing machine.Prosecutors said this was further evidence that her crimes were pre-meditated.\u00a0District Attorney Michael Allen said of Stauch's crimes: '(Gannon) deserved to live. He deserved to grow up and become a young man and someday have a family of his own. She took it all away.'",
