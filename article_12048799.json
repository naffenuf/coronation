        "'He's just so in tune, he's such a brilliant guy anyway, like he's so learned in so many things, and you can just tell when he's had his kids, he read every book and everything you could possibly learn about children, and he applies it and is present and that's all you can ask for, is a present, loving dad who cares and who shows up every single day, and that's who he is.'Jennifer and Ben combined their families after tying the knot last year - the Waiting For Tonight songstress has 15-year-old twins Emme and Max with her ex-husband Marc Anthony, while Affleck has\u00a0Violet, 17, Seraphina, 14, Samuel, 11, from his previous marriage to Jennifer Garner.\u00a0Now a mother of teenagers, Jennifer said it has been difficult watching her children starting to 'individuate' themselves from her.\u00a0",

        "'A little bit younger, let's just say it. And it's exciting to be able to do it now, I think for me, it's really kind of empowering and makes me feel strong and good.'The Jenny From The Block singer described how her background in\u00a0dance helped her pick up the fight routines.\u00a0'It was regular fight training, but it was choreographed. You have to be efficient, I can't be fighting eight hours a day. After an hour, I'm like, OK!\u00a0'So they had to be real efficient and we choreographed almost like a dance, which is good for me since I'm a dancer, so I can kind of do it step by step and I just learn it from there.'"
