        "Lee Westwood has accused the DP World Tour of being \u201cfully in bed\u201d with the PGA Tour after announcing his resignation from the European circuit.",
        "Westwood and fellow Ryder Cup stars Ian Poulter and Sergio Garcia have resigned their membership and are therefore no longer eligible for the biennial contest against the United States.The trio were among the players fined \u00a3100,000 and suspended for two tournaments after playing the first LIV Golf event last year without permission.Westwood and Poulter were also among the 12 members of the Saudi-funded breakaway who lost an appeal against the sanctions last month and were deemed to have committed \u201cserious breaches\u201d of the DP World Tour\u2019s code of behaviour by a three-man arbitration panel.Westwood confirmed he has paid the fine and is keen to \u201cmove on\u201d, but reiterated his criticism of the way the PGA Tour and DP World Tour have reacted to the emergence of LIV Golf.\u201cI\u2019ve been a dual member of the European Tour and PGA Tour, but always said I was a European Tour member first and foremost and that I had fears about the US circuit basically being bullies and doing everything it could to secure global dominance,\u201d Westwood told The Telegraph.\u201cCheck my old quotes, it\u2019s all there.",
        "\u201cBut now, in my opinion, the European Tour has jumped fully in bed with the PGA Tour and even though Keith (Pelley, the chief executive) says he hates to hear it, it is now a feeder tour for the PGA Tour.",
        "\u201cThe top 10 players on the tour, not already exempt this year, have a pathway to the PGA Tour \u2013 that\u2019s giving our talent away. That was never the tour\u2019s policy before this \u2018strategic alliance\u2019.\u201cSorry, I don\u2019t want to play under that sort of regime.\u201cI mulled it over and just didn\u2019t like the thought of the tour continuously hitting us with more fines and bans that would have been hanging over me.\u201cI\u2019ve paid my fine out of respect for the arbitration panel and have then taken the decisions out of the tour\u2019s hands. I honestly want to move on.\u201d"
