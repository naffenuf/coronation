        "For those wondering why The Kardashians producer-star Kylie Jenner decided to wear Jean Paul Gaultier at Monday's Met Gala and why the French luxury fashion house chose her to front its new Flowers Collection campaign, the answer is Haider Ackermann.",
        "The 52-year-old JPG guest designer just so happens to be an extremely close friend and collaborator of the 25-year-old Kylie Cosmetics CEO's rumored boyfriend, Oscar nominee Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet.'Haider is one of my closest friends and a creative from a lost era,' the 27-year-old native New Yorker gushed to System Magazine last fall.'His is the rare passion that cares about the purity of design, shapes, colors, textures, and the feelings they evoke. He couldn't possibly pretend to care about a fashion cycle or algorithm-influenced trends - his talent and creativity are set to last because he is following his own drum beat, no one else's.'Haider said of Timoth\u00e9e: 'Sometimes you meet someone, and you just know you can build a story together and have a moment together that may really last.'",
        "Chalamet has been wearing Ackermann's designs as far back as February 2017, when he was still designing for the Italian luxury house of Berluti, and they were introduced by his agent Brian Swardstrom.In 2021, the Bones and All producer-star and the Colombian-born Frenchman co-designed a hoodie benefitting the feminist non-profit organization, Afghanistan Libre.Timoth\u00e9e and Haider affectionately call each other 'big bro' and 'lil bro.'It was previously believed that Chalamet - who served as Met Gala co-chair in 2021 - styled himself for events, but Ackermann has clearly been a major influence.",
        "'I hear about celebrities who have stylists, and that blows my mind,' the Entergalactic actor marveled to Time Out back in 2018.'It's certainly not why I act, but I can wear cool clothes from some of the nicest designers in the world. So why am I going to pay someone to figure out what I should be wearing? That's the fun part.'On Monday, Kylie bared her right arm and leg in the red and blue gown and strappy pumps custom designed by Haider to attend The Metropolitan Museum of Art's $50K/ticket Costume Institute benefit in Manhattan.Jenner is clearly close with Ackermann as they both showcased in their behind-the-scenes snaps from the star-studded fashion festivities.",
        "Haider was dutifully by the Calabasas socialite's side when she wore his black custom JPG gown to Diddy, Doja Cat, and Richie Akiva's Met Gala after-party at the Box - but they were turned away because it was 'over capacity,' according to Page Six.And on Tuesday, Kylie flashed her bra and corset beneath a sheer floral frock designed by Ackermann for the launch of JPG's ready-to-wear Flowers Collection, which drops this Friday at noon.There have been unconfirmed reports that Jenner and Timoth\u00e9e met as far back as 2019 at Nobu Malibu before ringing in the New Year in Aspen, attending Paris Fashion Week in January, and dining on Tito's Tacos in LA as recent as April 14.",
        "Chalamet - who's fluent in French - previously romanced his The King leading lady Lily-Rose Depp, Mexican actress Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez, and Madonna's eldest Lourdes Leon.The GLOW paid partner has two children - daughter Stormi, 5; and son Aire, 15 months - from her on/off five-year relationship with disgraced Astroworld founder Travis Scott, which ended in December.The Independent Spirit Award winner will next reprise his role as Duke-turned-Fremen Paul Atreides in Denis Villeneuve's sequel Dune: Part Two, which hits US/UK theaters November 3.The ensemble also features Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Josh Brolin, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd, Dave Bautista, Stephen McKinley Henderson, Charlotte Rampling, Javier Bardem, Florence Pugh, Austin Butler, L\u00e9a Seydoux, and Christopher Walken.The Canadian 55-year-old filmmaker's critically-acclaimed first installment - based on Frank Herbert's 1965 sci-fi novel - amassed $402M at the global box office in 2021.",
        "Kylie and her famous family will next compete for the best docu-reality show trophy at the 2023 MTV Movie &amp; TV Awards, which air next Sunday.The Kardashians face heavy competition against Jersey Shore: Family Vacation, The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, Family Reunion: Love &amp; Hip Hop Edition, and Vanderpump Rules.In the trailer for season three - premiering May 25 on Hulu - Jenner surprisingly told her sisters: 'All of us just need to have a bigger conversation about the beauty standards that we\u2019re setting.'",
        "The selfie enthusiast - who's only ever admitted to having lip fillers - cryptically said she didn't want her daughter 'to do the things I did' seemingly to adapt the same hip and rear-boosting tactics as her half-sisters Kim and Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian.Kylie - who's also an executive producer - admitted to her similarly-enhanced gal pal Anastasia 'Stassie' Karanikolaou in the preview: 'I wish I'd never touched anything to begin with.'"
