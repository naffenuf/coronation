        "The actress, 35, played the role of\u00a0Tina McIntyre from 2008 until 2014, before moving onto other successful TV roles.She has now told the Radio Times how leaving the popular show was 'always a risk' and that at the time she had to come to terms with 'the idea of not acting again'.\u00a0The beauty - who is married to former TOWIE star Mark Wright, 36, - explained: 'When I decided to leave Corrie, I remember coming to terms with the idea of not acting again.\u00a0'I always said to myself, 'If I don't get a job after this, at least I've had a good run: not many people can say they've had this career for six and a half years.'\u00a0",
        "'The decision to leave was always a risk but it was the right thing for me at the time, so I'd never have regretted it. If it hadn't worked out, I'd have done something to do with dogs \u2013 that's my happy place.'She was cast in the soap after only her second ever audition and has now described what it was like going back to auditions when she left the popular ITV show.\u00a0Michelle explained: 'It was terrifying. I never in my wildest dreams thought I'd get Corrie so I went along to that audition with the mindset that it would just be good experience.\u00a0",
        "'Then, after seven years, to go back into the big wide world again was scary. A soap is so safe.'Michelle is next starring in the 1950s drama Ten Pound Poms as nurse Kate Thorne which was filmed in Australia last year.\u00a0The upcoming BBC show that dramatises the famous Assisted Passage Migration Scheme, which brought more than a million people to Australia after World War II.During the chat with the Radio Times Michelle also touched on whether she is still typecast for certain roles.Ten Pound Poms premieres May 14, available only on Stan.\u00a0",
        "She said: 'Yeah. Don't get me wrong, I'm very lucky with the roles I've chosen but there have been brilliant scripts which are very similar to something I've just done.'You think, 'This would be great at another time but let's try and change it up a little bit.' It's hard to say no, though.'It comes after earlier this week Michelle\u00a0shared a series of behind-the-scenes shots from filming Ten Pound Poms.\u00a0Taking to Instagram to post the slideshow of images, Michelle looked stunning as she posed in a vintage purple tea dress in one shot.\u00a0Another photo showed the star and members of the cast grinning in 1950s finery as they relaxed on set.",
        "Elsewhere in the gallery were snaps of the scenery for the BBC show, a pretty sunset and an image of Luna Park, a theme park in Melbourne.She captioned her post: '1 week to go before Ten Pound Poms takes you back to 1956.'\u00a0It came after\u00a0Michelle opened up about the daunting task of spending months away from home and husband Mark as she filmed the new series.The actress, who wed the reality star in 2015, described travelling alone as 'quite scary' as she left behind her life and loved ones in the UK, as filming took place throughout last summer.\u00a0Recalling the production process she said: 'I absolutely loved filming in Australia. I mean, when I first got there the weather wasn't great, I'm not going to lie, but as a country I really enjoyed it.'In fact, in a way my journey to Australia has parallels with Kate's. It was my first time too and I didn't know what to expect, I came on my own which was quite scary, but it's been such an incredible experience.'Mark did manage to make trips to visit his wife down under\u00a0and the pair shared snaps of their romantic reunions on social media last year.\u00a0Back in July discussing their 'tough' long distance relationship,\u00a0Mark told MailOnline:\u00a0'If you're in love and in a happy relationship you will be happy to see each other'.",
        "'You have to learn that you've been together for a long time and not seen each other in three weeks so it's exciting at first but then it goes back to being a 10 year relationship.'The longer you go, the more pressure there is because the longer it's been. But I was in LA and had a dinner with Piers Morgan and I told him it was hard. He said: 'I had this with my wife and we have a 3 weeks rule so don't let it go past 3 weeks.'\u00a0Before going on say: 'It's tough though with Australia, it's a lot of flying.'Michelle also discussed what she loved about the country ahead of the show's upcoming premiere.Gushing: 'The Australian actors are so brilliant and they bring a different energy to the set'.\u00a0'The thing I miss most about Australia is the people. I know it's such a clich\u00e9d thing to say, but everyone out there is so lovely, friendly and welcoming. The crew really got on and it was such a nice working environment - and of course I miss the cast'.",
        "Discussing the show's difficult subject matter she said: 'Ten Pound Poms will definitely take the audience on a journey'.\u00a0'I think for me and for the viewers, the script is like a history lesson. I didn't know a lot about the Ten Pound Poms before being part of this project but I did a lot of research into it'.\u00a0",
        "Before adding: Now I've talked to lots of people who say: 'Yeah, my grandmother was a Ten Pound Pom and I have family in Australia' and that all stemmed from what happened in the 1950s.Earlier this week the show's trailer debuted, featuring actors\u00a0Faye Marsay (Game of Thrones) and\u00a0Warren Brown (Luther).\u00a0They play a married couple, The Roberts, who come to Australia in 1956\u00a0after paying just \u00a310 for their passage out.The Australian government promise them a better house, better job prospects and a better quality of life Down Under, far away from dreary post-war England.But the family soon discover the grim reality of migrant life as they battle\u00a0the poor living conditions in a hostel for 'New Australians', as well as prejudice.The series will premiere Sunday May 14 at 9pm on BBC1."
