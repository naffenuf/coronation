        "Guto Harri, who served as No 10\u2019s director of communications under the former prime minister, claimed Mr Johnson told him he \u201cwent in quite hard\u201d on the then-prince.Mr Johnson disputed his long-standing ally\u2019s account as \u201cinaccurate\u201d, with a source saying he \u201cdeplores\u201d any commentary on conversations with royals.Charles and Mr Johnson discussed the King\u2019s reported criticism of the scheme as they met in Rwanda\u2019s capital of Kigali at a Commonwealth summit in June.",

He had obviously expressed some criticism, and though he tried to play it down, Boris pointed out the obvious, (saying): \u2018If you didn\u2019t say it we both know your people could ring the newspapers and kill the story.

It does not accurately reflect any conversation\u201cWe would never comment on these matters and Mr Johnson deplores any attempt to do so.\u201d"
