        "At the top of the second inning Baddoo tried to steal a base for his team, when the Cleveland catcher\u00a0Mike Zunino took the pitch at\u00a0Miguel Cabrera and fired the ball towards second.Baddoo was scrambling to get there in time and made a desperate slide to get to the base before the ball, only for the ball to hit him right where it hurts.And if matters weren't painful enough for the 24-year-old, the ball then bounced off his groin and into the glove of Guardians second baseman Andes Gimenez.Baddoo was recoiling in pain on the floor after the hit and initially, commentators thought he had hurt his ankle or leg until they saw a replay.",
        "And the Guardians themselves didn't want to celebrate too excessively for getting Baddoo out.They tweeted the clip out and said: 'We don't know what to say. Just watch.'Baddoo played on for his team though, despite the very obvious pain that he was in.
