        "The actress, 36, who plays the film's main character Elphaba, was easily recognisable due to her painted green skin, which was reminiscent of the iconic witch.Filming took place over the weekend on Hankley Common in Surrey and will become the backdrop for Munchkin Country.Munchkin Country is the fictional eastern region of the Land of Oz and home to the famous Yellow Brick Road, which members of the crew were seen building.While they laid the yellow bricks, Cynthia and her body double were pictured filming a flight seen where the character flies through the air.",
        "Cynthia, 36, was wearing a tall black witches hat teamed with long robes and a leather trench coat, while her long wig cascaded down he back.At one stage she could be seen wielding a broomstick, which was likely being used for the scene where she flies through the air.Cynthia or her body double were then strapped into a harness and suspended from two supportive ropes in order to safely shoot the scene.The role of\u00a0Elphaba\u00a0was originated by\u00a0Idina Menzel\u00a0in the 2003 Broadway production, while\u00a0Tony winning actress Carole Shelley played\u00a0Madame Morrible.It also\u00a0starred\u00a0Kristin Chenoweth\u00a0in Ariana's role of Galinda/Glinda.Excitement on the movie has been building after it was revealed that early scenes were shown at CinemaCon in Las Vegas, wowing audiences - however, it is not scheduled to be released until November next year.",
