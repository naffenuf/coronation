        "Sam Allardyce claimed he is as good a manager as Pep Guardiola, Jurgen Klopp and Mikel Arteta as he was unveiled as Leeds\u2019 new boss on Wednesday.",
        "Leeds have turned to former England manager Allardyce, 68, in a last-ditch bid to retain their Premier League status after sacking Javi Gracia with four games remaining.Allardyce, relegated from the top flight for the first time in his 30-year managerial career in his last job at West Brom two years ago, said: \u201cFar too many people think that I am old and antiquated, which is far from the truth.",
        "\u201cI might be 68 and old, but there\u2019s nobody ahead of me in football terms. Not Pep, not Klopp, not Arteta.\u201cIt\u2019s all there with me. They do what they do, I do what I do. In terms of knowledge and depth of knowledge, I\u2019m up there with them. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m better than them, but certainly as good as they are.\u201dFormer Bolton, Newcastle, West Ham and Everton boss Allardyce takes charge of his first game for Leeds at Guardiola\u2019s title-chasing Manchester City on Saturday.Having already removed director of football Victor Orta, Leeds announced the departure of Gracia on Wednesday morning along with his backroom staff.Allardyce said: \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of responses from many people that I know sending their congratulations. A few others said I must be mad.\u201cBut I enjoy the game so much and to try and save this club and keep it in the Premier League is a big responsibility and a big challenge. But it\u2019s one I\u2019m prepared to take because of who Leeds are.\u201d",
        "Allardyce is the club\u2019s third permanent manager of the season, with Gracia having replaced Jesse Marsch in February.The former England boss is hoping for an immediate response from a demoralised squad who are languishing in 17th place, out of the relegation zone only on goal difference.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s probably only the biggest challenge (of my career) because of the shortness of games that are left,\u201d he said.Allardyce is reported to have agreed a basic salary of \u00a3500,000 for his four games in charge, with a \u00a32.5million bonus if he can keep Leeds up.When asked if there was a chance he would stay at Elland Road beyond the remainder of this season, he said: \u201cNever say never.\u201cIt depends what happens at the end of the four matches and what the conversation is all about, how I feel and more importantly how my wife feels.\u201d",
        "Former MK Dons, Charlton and Oxford boss Karl Robinson will be Allardyce\u2019s assistant and ex-Leeds striker Robbie Keane has also joined the backroom staff.Allardyce had hoped to have been assisted by Sammy Lee, who is unavailable after being refused permission to cancel jury duty.\u201cThe judge has left Sammy unemployed and wouldn\u2019t let them off,\u201d Allardyce added. \u201cI think it\u2019s very poor judgment indeed. It\u2019s a real shame because he loves being with me and I love having him with me.\u201d",
        "After Allardyce\u2019s first game at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday, Leeds face Champions League hopefuls Newcastle at Elland Road the following week.The final two games of the season are a trip to West Ham, one of Allardyce\u2019s former clubs, and the visit of Tottenham, who are bidding to qualify for Europe.Leeds have lost five of their last seven games, with Sunday\u2019s 4-1 reverse at Bournemouth following 4-1, 5-1 and 6-1 defeats to Arsenal, Crystal Palace and Liverpool respectively last month.On Sunday, fans\u2019 group the Leeds United Supporters Advisory Board issued a vote of no confidence in both the club\u2019s board and Gracia.The players subsequently issued a statement on Monday apologising for their performance at Bournemouth and for failing to acknowledge fans at the team hotel.",
        "Gracia leaves Leeds after only 11 league games in charge. The Spaniard collected 10 points from his first six fixtures, but a dreadful run of results in April left the club in a downward spiral.Gracia said in a statement: \u201cI\u2019m grateful for this opportunity and proud of the team, both players and coaching staff. That\u2019s how I would like to summarise my time at Leeds United.\u201cI would have preferred a different moment, but the circumstances have changed. We arrived on a short three-month contract, and we did it because we believed in this team.\u201d"
