        "Celtic full-back Alistair Johnston might play again this season while Cameron Carter-Vickers is expected to be back for the start of next term.",
        "Canada international Johnston joined the post-match celebrations at Hampden on crutches after suffering a lower-leg injury following a challenge on Rangers defender Borna Barisic in Sunday\u2019s Scottish Cup semi-final.Carter-Vickers was the best player on the park despite playing through a knee injury which has ended his campaign but Celtic have received positive news following his operation.Johnston will sit out Sunday\u2019s game against Hearts at Tynecastle as Celtic bid to get a win which will secure a second cinch Premiership title under Ange Postecoglou.But the 24-year-old could be fit ahead of the Scottish Cup final against Inverness on June 3.\u201cHe got a significant knock,\u201d Postecoglou said. \u201cWe will see. There is still a chance he will be available before the end of the season but it will be a week-by-week thing and we will see how he goes.",
        "\u201cCameron (Carter-Vickers) will be out until the start of next season and James Forrest is probably a week away.\u201cThe only other new one is Stephen Welsh who picked up a knock in training. Everyone else is good to go.\u201dCentre-back Carter-Vickers looks set to be fit to join his team-mates for pre-season training.\u201cHe has already had the surgery and the reports are that it went really well and he should be right for the start of the season, to begin the season, which is great news for us,\u201d Postecoglou said.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s something he has carried for a significant part of this year but he was really keen to play, particularly up until last weekend knowing what the game meant for our season.\u201cBut it\u2019s fair to say he hasn\u2019t been able to train at the levels he wants to and can sometimes perform, but he has never used that as an excuse.\u201cHe was outstanding for us this year and it\u2019s great for him to get it seen to now and know that at the start of the season he will be ready to go.\u201dJapanese central defender Yuki Kobayashi is set for a run in the team after making four appearances since his arrival in January.\u201cHe is ready to go,\u201d Postecoglou said. \u201cHe has done well for us every time we have called upon him.\u201cWe brought him in in January to use this second half of the season to bed him in in terms of our football and how we train, to let him adjust. Yuki is ready to step up and play a significant role.\u201d"
