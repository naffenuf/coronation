        "Pep Guardiola has said Kalvin Phillips\u2019 Manchester City future is in his own hands.",
        "The \u00a342million summer signing has made only eight Premier League appearances for City, all as a substitute, and will be eager to make a ninth when his former club Leeds visit the Etihad on Saturday.Phillips suffered an early setback in his City career with shoulder surgery in September, but since returning in November he has found it impossible to dislodge Rodri from the base of Guardiola\u2019s midfield, with John Stones now also stepping out of defence into a more advanced position.The England midfielder\u2019s lack of playing time has prompted speculation that the player and club might part ways this summer, but Guardiola said no decisions would be taken now.",
        "\u201cIt depends on the players,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cAt the end we\u2019re here, I try to be honest with the questions and my feelings.\u201cMy feelings sometimes change. But at the end it belongs to the players, they have to convince themselves and the team and not because I say something.\u201cThey have to earn my confidence. All of them, not just Kalvin, all of them how they perform. Teams change a lot and players for previous seasons who were incredibly important but this season less important. It\u2019s how they perform, many things can happen.\u201dCity continue to compete on three fronts. They can move four points clear of Arsenal at the top of the Premier League if they beat Leeds, with the first leg of their Champions League semi-final away to Real Madrid on Tuesday immediately following, and an FA Cup final against Manchester United booked for June.",
        " They have to earn my confidence. All of them, not just Kalvin, all of them how they perform  Pep Guardiola  Guardiola said the tightness of the Premier League title race has worked against Phillips.\u201cI\u2019m not complaining about Kalvin because when you don\u2019t play much it\u2019s difficult to take the rhythm,\u201d Guardiola said.\u201cJohn we\u2019re seven years together, Rodri is (four) years together. I don\u2019t have to tell them anything. Just little details \u2013 a movement here or there.\u201cKalvin if maybe in the past he\u2019d played more minutes he will get that but Rodri was in exceptional form. That role is so, so important, that\u2019s why the lack of minutes makes the circle more difficult. But he always pays attention, in the training sessions he is always open-minded to get it.",
        "\u201cBut being behind Arsenal, we cannot drop points. We haven\u2019t had that situation of being eight, 10 points in front \u2013 in the past it happened. He can do it, but in that moment I always had the feeling Rodri knows exactly what to do in the role.\u201dGuardiola also cited that relentless schedule when he said he had not given any thought as to whether Phillips has a long-term future at the club.\u201cWhat happens next season, I\u2019m not concerned for one second now,\u201d he said.",
        "\u201cWe will see at the end of the season. We\u2019ll sit with the players. Maybe they want more minutes or maybe they are not happy with the situation. But right now I\u2019m not going to discuss anything.\u201d",
        "City have failed to win only twice at home all season, something Guardiola put down to the \u201cvibe\u201d they are enjoying in front of their fans.As they play on the day of the King\u2019s Coronation, the Catalan said he was eager to make sure that continued.\u201cThere is no time to keep something in the fridge,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to give everything, it\u2019s so close.\u201cWe still have one game in hand, important tough games. We saw Brighton (beat Manchester United) and we still have to go there.\u201cWe have just two games at home \u2013 Leeds and Chelsea \u2013 and we need our people. Please come at 3pm if you don\u2019t have anything better to do. There are important things in this country but anyway, if you don\u2019t have anything more then come and help us because we need it.\u201d"
