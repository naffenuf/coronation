        "It's easy to sign up for these services - and they're great if you end up using them on a regular basis - but unless you're super organised you could be paying hundreds of pounds a year for services you may no longer use.For example, while the Magic Tiles app is free to download, upgrading to the VIP version costs \u00a33.99 per week, or \u00a3207 per year.",

        "If you use lots of different Apple services such as Apple Music, Fitness+ and Apple TV+ it's worth considering switching to an Apple One account. These plans bundle in a number of platforms for a cheaper price.",

There's also this same plan available with family member access for \u00a322.95 - saving \u00a39 per month.Finally, those wanting the best of everything can sign up for Apple's Premier plan which adds Apple Fitness+ and Apple News+.This costs \u00a332.95 - that's a saving of \u00a323 when compared to signing up for each service individually.If you've not checked your subscriptions for a while it's worth taking a look.
