        "Pharmacies will be asked to issue more prescriptions to free up appointmentsMinisters fear that some councillors will blame the Government for their defeat\u00a0Rishi Sunak will publish long-awaited proposals to improve access to GPs next week, in a bid to bounce back from yesterday\u2019s local elections.",
        "Downing Street has drawn up plans for a health-focused mini-relaunch in the coming days to demonstrate that the Prime Minister is focused on delivering on the public\u2019s priorities.The package will include the Government\u2019s delayed primary care plan which is designed to free up hundreds of thousands of GP appointments by asking pharmacists to issue more prescriptions.Mr Sunak was last night braced for the Conservatives to lose hundreds of seats in council elections across the country. Ministers fear that some councillors will blame the Government for their defeat.A Savanta poll yesterday found that 25 per cent of Conservative councillors are \u2018dissatisfied\u2019 with the leadership of the party, compared with 63 per cent who say they are satisfied. Some 34 per cent said they were unhappy with the direction of the country.",
        "In a damage-limitation exercise ahead of the poll, the PM acknowledged that the elections were \u2018going to be hard for us\u2019. \u2018Good councillors will lose their seats because of all that has happened over the past year,\u2019 he said.But he insisted that a \u2018tough night\u2019 should not \u2018dishearten\u2019 activists, adding that the Tories were still the party with \u2018energy and ideas\u2019.A senior Tory source said: \u2018The circumstances mean this round of elections was always going to be very difficult for us. We are mid-term and the country want us to deliver on their priorities.",
        "\u2018I think that after the Coronation you will see the Prime Minister move on pretty quickly to do exactly that.\u2019",
        "Ministers have faced calls to ease the difficulties faced by people trying to get a GP appointment, and end the \u20188am rush\u2019 which sees phone lines to surgeries jammed every morning.\u00a0Under plans to be published next week, pharmacists will be given wider powers for prescribing medicines to take pressure off GP practices.\u00a0GPs will also be encouraged to sign up to online triaging services which divert patients to the most appropriate care, reserving face-to-face appointments for patients in need.Ministers hope the focus on delivery in a key priority area will quickly overshadow the impact of the local election results.\u00a0Experts have predicted the Tories could lose up to 1,000 seats while Sir Keir Starmer is under pressure to pick up at least 700 Labour seats. Yesterday\u2019s election was the first national poll held with voter ID requirements.But despite warnings millions of voters could miss out, early reports suggested only a small number were turned away from polling stations for not having suitable ID.The Association of Electoral Administrators said polls had been \u2018running as smoothly as usual\u2019."
