        "Rob Edwards was happy to extend Luton\u2019s unbeaten run to 14 games after a much-changed side were held to a goalless Sky Bet Championship draw by Hull.",
        "The Hatters boss swapped eight of his players with an eye on Saturday\u2019s play-off semi-final first-leg clash against Sunderland, but those selected kept a 20th clean sheet of the season.Edwards said: \u201cToday was about resting key players, let\u2019s be honest.\u201cIt was about making sure we didn\u2019t risk anyone unnecessarily and it was about giving some players some game time as over the next couple of games, if they\u2019re needed, we want people up to speed, so I think it was twofold and overall it was a successful day.\u201cI want to say well done to (Hull manager) Liam Rosenior and what they\u2019ve done this season as well because he\u2019s building a good style there and they\u2019re difficult to go and press at times.\u201cFor some of the lads who haven\u2019t played that much, to do a lot of double runs and a lot of pressing was good and also when we had the ball, especially in the first half, we showed some good control, and were brave with it.",
        "\u201cWe did create one or two decent chances and moments but the game fizzled out a little bit towards the end.\u201dA quiet first half saw Allahyar Sayyadmanesh\u2019s shot deflect onto the post for Hull, before Joe Taylor\u2019s header drew a great save from visiting keeper Matt Ingram.",
        "Adama Traore was denied by Luton stopper James Shea and Hatters substitute Luke Berry saw his chip from just inside the visitors\u2019 half drop narrowly over the bar.Tigers boss Rosenior said: \u201cThe final game sums up where we are.\u201cWe played some breathtaking football at times, I was pleased with the first two-thirds of our game in terms of our build-up, we caused problems, they had to change everything, which is what teams are having to do against us.\u201cBut when we got into the final third into some unbelievable positions, it just fizzled out, and that\u2019s no disrespect to our players, I\u2019ve got no strikers.\u201cIn those critical moments against very good teams you need that cutting edge and that\u2019s something I\u2019m going to work really, really hard in the summer to address.\u201cThey had one chance where Matty\u2019s made a really good save from the header from a cross, I can\u2019t remember another real threatening moment in the game for us.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of positives to build on, anyone who understands the game can see I\u2019ve got a group of players who completely understand the way we want to play.\u201cWe\u2019re building, so there\u2019s a lot to be excited about.\u201d"
