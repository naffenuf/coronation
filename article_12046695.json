        "The finance-to-property group has said it plans to cease production at the site in Selby after years of weak demand.It is understood that the group has launched consultations with all 475 staff at the L&amp;G Modular Homes business, with plans to make the majority of workers redundant.The firm said it will review and assess \u201cpotential strategic options\u201d for the division after halting operations.L&amp;G blamed \u201clong planning delays\u201d and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic for weakness in the firm\u2019s pipeline of orders for new homes. Without the necessary scale of pipeline it is not sustainable to continue producing more modules  Bill Hughes, Legal &amp; General Modular Homes  It added that the group has not been able to \u201csustain the significant running costs of the large factory in Selby\u201d as a result.",
        "Bill Hughes, chairman of Legal &amp; General Modular Homes\u2019 board, said: \u201cLegal &amp; General is proud of what we have achieved in bringing forward a new approach to construction through our factory.\u201cHowever, without the necessary scale of pipeline it is not sustainable to continue producing more modules.\u201cWe are therefore reluctantly proposing to reduce business activity and cease production of new modules at the factory.\u201cRegrettably, this includes commencing consultation with all employees around the proposal to make the majority of modular homes roles redundant.",
        "\u201cWe recognise this will be a challenging and uncertain period for our staff and we will be actively exploring redeployment opportunities and supporting them during this difficult time.\u201d"
