        "Royal superfans camping out ahead of the coronation are wearing thermals to keep warm and organising shifts to keep their front-row seats to see \u201chistory in the making\u201d.",
        "Alongside the tents lining The Mall, Union Flags are draped next to cardboard cut-outs of the late Queen and the occasional inflatable corgi.Their occupants will be close to the action when the coronation procession leaves Buckingham Palace for Westminster Abbey on Saturday.",
        "Clutching a small King figurine, Jenny Smart, from Chiddingfold, Surrey, said: \u201cI\u2019m having a really good time actually. Just taking part in the atmosphere and so I came last night to check it all out. But I came this morning to set up my camp.\u201cThe coronation in a way doesn\u2019t mean anything because he\u2019s already our King. He\u2019s already acceded to the throne the moment the Queen died, so actually the coronation doesn\u2019t mean anything. It\u2019s just an enjoyable event and ceremony.\u201cThe country I would say is very split between monarchists, anti-monarchists and those who are somewhat indifferent.\u201cSo I think for a large part of the country it\u2019s just a nice extra holiday, but there\u2019s certainly a very strong contingent who love everything royal and are doing crazy things like this.\u201d",
        "Alyssa Whaanga, 23, who is originally from New Zealand but lives in London, said she was part of a \u201creally committed\u201d shift system of 20 people.Friends through the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, the group had been working in shifts since Tuesday to keep their spot.",
        "She said: \u201cI\u2019m going to be here until the coronation for the next two nights, so we\u2019ve got our tents set up here and food supplies coming.\u201cPeople coming in shifts also, so we\u2019re really committed to it. There\u2019s like 20 of us coming but we\u2019re all coming at different times. Most people will be here on Friday because people have jobs and a life.\u201d",
        "Ms Whaanga added she had also enjoyed meeting the other campers, even though she and her friends were younger than many of their neighbours.She said: \u201cYou meet some really cool people, super diverse.\u201cThere is a bit of an age demographic going on, so you\u2019ve got to, you know, represent the young\u2019uns.\u201dGwenda Griffiths, from Swansea, South Wales, was also sharing the experience with friends, who she made at the late Queen\u2019s funeral.Ms Griffiths, a nurse, also visited the capital for the jubilee celebrations last summer and has tickets for the coronation concert in Windsor on Sunday.",
        "She said: \u201cVarious friends I made at the Queen\u2019s funeral are joining me later today, hence why we\u2019ve taken up so much space.\u201cThen on Sunday, we\u2019ve been fortunate enough, my sister and I, to get tickets in the ballot for the concert at Windsor Castle. So we\u2019re fully doing the full shebang.\u201d",
        "Although Ms Griffiths said she was \u201cvery much\u201d looking forward to the big day, she said the weather had been tricky and she had a raincoat packed for Saturday.She added: \u201cIt was very cold last night. But thermals, woolly hat \u2013 the only thing I took off was my shoes.\u201dBraden Miller, 17, flew for 10 hours to visit London with his mother Rebecca, from Vacaville, California.",
        "The mother and son have also reunited with a friend they met while camping out for the jubilee last summer.Mr Miller, who is staying on The Mall until Saturday morning, predicted a rise in popularity for the royal family.He said: \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to seeing them on the balcony. It\u2019s a new era really. So I\u2019m really looking forward to seeing history in the making.\u201cI think the royal family is always changing, people\u2019s perception of it is always changing.\u201cI think we\u2019re going to see a growth in popularity honestly, when it comes towards like William and Catherine.\u201cI know a lot of people don\u2019t like Charles and Camilla but I think they\u2019ve really grown on people and clearly a lot of people love them here.\u201d"
