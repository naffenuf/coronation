        "Fulham boss Marco Silva is feeling smug about his side\u2019s Premier League position after recalling pre-season predictions that they were destined for relegation.",
        "This might be one of the closest survival battles in recent memory, but last season\u2019s Championship winners are not one of the teams worrying about a potentially heart-breaking end to the campaign.Instead, Silva\u2019s men are 10th, maintaining their top-half status despite picking up just seven points in their last 10 league contests.He said: \u201cYou have to be pleased. You have to be really proud, because I knew what everyone was saying at the beginning of the season about Fulham. I knew we were the favourites (to be relegated).\u201cSome people even without a doubt said we will be the first ones to get relegated, and of course we have to be pleased. Not because of what the people said, because they have to comment, they have to give their opinions, but much more for ourselves.\u201cFirstly for our fans because the last two seasons in the Premier League they were really tough for them, and they deserve much more, and the other because I believe, and I said from the last days of last season that I felt that this football club belongs in the Premier League and we showed that during the season.\u201d",
        "In Leicester, Fulham face an opponent in a very different fight from leaders Manchester City and Europe-chasing Liverpool, who got the better of Silva\u2019s side in their most recent meetings, but the Portuguese intends to approach Monday\u2019s meeting with the same overall\u00a0philosophy.",
        "He said: \u201cIn terms of preparation nothing is different. We always prepare ourselves the same way, with different strategies, of course.\u201cAgainst City we knew that we probably wouldn\u2019t have the ball as often as we would like, Liverpool more or less the same thing even if they are slightly different.\u201cAnd against Leicester of course playing at the Cottage we are going to try to have control of the game even though you know you are going to face a team with a lot of quality around the pitch.\u201cIt will be a different game definitely than the previous two matches but it will be a tough game in the same way. The approach will be the same. We are going to prepare ourselves to be at our best level.\u201d"
