Aluminium fell 1.9% to $2,321 per tonne.\"The market has been caught up in the general nervousness regarding the global economic outlook,\" Saxo Bank strategist Ole Hansen said.Commodity markets were under pressure on Wednesday with oil prices plunging as much as 4.8% as the Fed is expected to raise interest rates on Wednesday and the European Central Bank is expected to hike rates on Thursday.\"Markets are fearing demand destruction from tighter monetary policy,\" said WisdomTree analyst Nitesh Shah.Copper might be doing better than aluminium because its market is tighter in the long term, he added.The copper market is expected to be in deficit this year with improved Chinese demand, the International Copper Study Group said last week.
