        "If you associate chicken with dry, bland childhood dinners, you probably were eating boneless, skinless breast. It does the job, but it\u00b4s inherently flavorless and easy to overcook.",
        "That\u00b4s why we often call for boneless, skin-on chicken thighs. Not only is darker meat juicier and more flavorful, its higher fat content makes it more forgiving in the pan. Combine that with an elegant but simple classic French preparation, and you won\u00b4t have to worry Mom is forcing a smile during dinner on Mother\u00b4s Day.In this recipe from our book \"Tuesday Nights Mediterranean,\" which features weeknight-friendly meals from the region, we take inspiration from artichauts \u00e0 la barigoule. This classic Proven\u00e7al braise combines fresh artichoke hearts with aromatic vegetables, herbs and white wine. In our version, we sear chicken thighs on the stovetop, then finish cooking them in the oven. Meanwhile, we used canned artichokes in a simplified barigoule with carrots, garlic and onion that serves as both a vegetable accompaniment and a flavorful sauce.For subtle lemony notes, we simmer strips of zest with the artichokes. A Y-style vegetable peeler is the best tool for removing zest in strips from the fruit, but try to take only the yellow peel, as the white pith underneath is bitter. In this recipe, it\u00b4s best to avoid jarred marinated artichoke hearts; the seasonings will overpower the other ingredients.Be sure to serve this with warm, crusty bread to dip in the sauce. To complete the meal, toss some mixed greens and halved cherry tomatoes with a drizzle of olive oil and squeeze of lemon juice.",
