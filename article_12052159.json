        "While Neil Smith is revving engines as the Kansas Motor Speedway's NASCAR grand marshal on Sunday, his alma mater pushed the recruitment of three-star athlete Keelan Smith across the finish line.",
        "Keelan Smith, a \"hybrid\" receiver who can play running back or tight end, committed to Nebraska and coach Matt Rhule on Friday. The Missouri native had 11 touchdowns as a junior last season and is expected to remain in the Class of 2024 rather than reclassify. At 6-3, 209, he's viewed as a prospect at outside linebacker in addition to the offensive role.Neil Smith's college teammate, Danny Noonan, also has a son in the Huskers' 2024 recruiting class: defensive end Maverick Noonan. Danny Noonan was the No. 12 pick in the 1987 NFL Draft by the Dallas Cowboys. He was a contract holdout, but overcame injuries to unseat Hall of Famer Randy White at defensive tackle.Smith had offers from Missouri, Kansas and others but opted to join a Top 25 recruiting class that is even deeper on NFL bloodlines.Linebacker Willis McGahee IV, son of the two-time Pro Bowl running back, is also in Rhule's '24 class.Neil Smith played defensive tackle at Nebraska and was the No. 2 overall pick in the 1988 NFL Draft by the Kansas City Chiefs. After registering 85.5 sacks in nine seasons with the Chiefs, he joined the division rival Denver Broncos and won back-to-back Super Bowl rings alongside John Elway. Smith retired after the 2000 season with 104.5 career sacks.",
