        "May 3 (Reuters) - Fast bowler Shabnim Ismail has announced her retirement from international cricket, a further blow for recent Twenty20 World Cup finalists South Africa who had relied heavily on the pace and guile of the quickest bowler in the women\u00b4s game.",
        "Ismail, 34, played in 241 international matches across one-day Internationals, Twenty20s and tests, and last appeared in February\u00b4s World Cup final loss to Australia at Newlands.She broke the record for the fastest ball recorded in women's cricket during that tournament when she was clocked at 128 kph (80 mph) against England in the semi-finals.\"After 16 years proudly representing my country, I have come to the difficult decision to retire from international cricket and move on to the next chapter of my life,\" Ismail said in a statement on Wednesday.\"I really believe that reducing the amount of cricket I play will enable me to do this, and playing in global leagues is the only way I see to be able to fit in both family and cricket.\"Ismail\u00b4s 191 wickets in ODIs is second only to India\u00b4s Jhulan Goswami (255) on the all-time list.Her retirement follows that of a trio of South African stalwarts from the last 15 years in former captains Dane van Niekerk and Mignon du Preez, and batter Lizelle Lee.(Reporting by Nick Said, editing by Ed Osmond)"
