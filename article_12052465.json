        "It was the footage that shocked America \u2013 and put New York City on edge: for two long minutes, video captured a Marine veteran holding a homeless man in a chokehold on the floor of subway car.",
        "The video from Monday showed 24-year-old Daniel Penny restraining 30-year-old Jordan Neely.Witnesses say Neely was throwing trash, yelling that he wanted to 'die' or 'go to jail' and menacing other subway riders.It\u2019s still unclear what occurred immediately before the men began wrestling, but apparently Penny tackled Neely and put him in a chokehold lasting longer than two minutes.Penny can be seen restraining him for 45 seconds even after Neely appears to go limp, and as a bystander warned: \u2018You're going to kill him.'Neely was later pronounced dead at the hospital. He had been known over the years for his Michael Jackson impersonations, but also more than a dozen run-ins with police - many related to his mental health struggles.Progressive politicians, like Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, have called for Penny to be prosecuted for murder, while fellow Democrat, New York City Mayor Eric Adams, has urged people to wait for the facts of the case to be establishment before making any judgments.However, many have already taken a position.Protesters demanding that Penny be charged have demonstrated in the downtown Manhattan subway station where the incident occurred, and more protests are expected this weekend.Amid all this DailyMail.com went into the city\u2019s streets and subways to ask ordinary New Yorkers \u2013 who ride the underground rails everyday \u2013 how they are reacting to this tragedy.",
        "\u2018THINGS HAVE GOTTEN WORSE\u2026 ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU\u2019RE A GIRL\u2019\u2018This week\u2019s killing was a result of the city, and they need to do a better job,\u2019 Rashad, a delivery worker who travels the trains for work, told DailyMail.com.Overall, New Yorkers who spoke to MailOnline agreed that, while disturbing incidents have always occurred on the NYC\u2019s trains, things have noticeably deteriorated since the Covid-19 pandemic began in 2020.Jay, an engineer living in downtown Brooklyn, just several subway stops away from the station where Neely, who was reportedly schizophrenic, was rendered unresponsive, said every time that he rides the subway, he encounters the mentally ill.\u2018They\u2019re just walking back and forth, so I don't feel safe,\u2019 he told DailyMail.com.Though while most men said that they do generally feel safe, they concede that it\u2019s very different for women.\u2018My wife's five feet nothing, and Asian, so it\u2019s not so safe for her,\u2019 said David, a retired public transportation worker. \u2018I\u2019m her security detail every time she's got to take the subway any place.\u2019Brianna, a young woman from downtown Manhattan, said she often faces sexual harassment. Yvette, a street vendor from Harlem, told DailyMail.com that she was even attacked while riding the subway two months ago.",
        "\u2018A homeless man punched me in the face after I accidentally touched him. I said I was sorry, but he got up screaming and punched me. He was arrested,\u2019 Yvette recalled. \u2018Things have gotten worse. It's not easy, especially when you're a girl.\u2019",
        "NEW YORKERS BECOMING \u2018DESENSITIZED\u2019 TO SUBWAY VIOLENCEOne fear many that New Yorkers shared with DailyMail.com is that they feel trapped when subway cars are traveling between stops, because in that time things can go horribly wrong.\u2018Police should be inside the train instead of outside because we have to wait until we stop to get any help,\u2019 Yvette said, recalling her harrowing assault.\u2018I was being attacked for about 3 to 5 minutes until the next stop, and then the cops intervened. [Bystanders] were running to the other side of the train. They were scared and nobody knew what this guy had on him.\u2019New Yorkers are so used to these troubling episodes that at least one woman was not even surprised to hear about Neely\u2019s death.\u2018To me, that's normal at this point. It\u2019s how the city is,\u2019 said Brianna from downtown Manhattan.Darrio, who lives in Long Island City in the nearby borough of Queens and works in Manhattan, compared his reaction to the tragedy to the desensitization that Americans experience after school shootings.\u2018In the beginning, you were flabbergasted. And then after a while, you stop getting so surprised,\u2019 he explained. \u2018Unfortunately, something happens, and you move on.\u2019",
        "Still, despite the constant danger, New Yorkers expressed sympathy for those living on the streets with mental illness.",
        "SYMPATHY FOR HOMELESS AND UNDERSTANDING FOR MARINE VET\u2018It\u2019s especially hard for the homeless because the cops mistreat them and then they\u2019re attacked by other homeless people, too,\u2019 said Yvette, even though she had been the victim of an attack herself. \u2018On top of being homeless, they\u2019re getting mistreated by everybody around.\u2019At the same time, many of the city\u2019s residents, including Jay, the engineer from Brooklyn, were not quick to condemn the Marine veteran who restrained Neely.\u2018I feel the person that did it tried to do something good and protect everybody around him,\u2019 he said. \u2018But I think he overdid it, and he just lost it. He held on to the person too long and when the person was unconscious, he should've realized the person wasn't a threat.\u2019Some even defended Penny, like former MTA worker David, who believes the veteran \u2018did the right thing\u2019 in a \u2018scary situation.\u2019Others were firm in their belief that Penny should face swift justice.\u2018I think he should be prosecuted,\u2019 said Karen, a social worker from Queens who avoids taking the train as much as possible because she doesn\u2019t feel safe. \u2018He took a life.\u2019Dario agreed, saying \u2018100 percent [Penny should at least be charged]\u2026 No matter his reason or logic as to why that was happening at the moment, we need due process.\u2019",
        "New Yorkers though could agree on one thing - the city is not doing enough to protect them.\u2018THE POLICE ARE NOT DOING THEIR BEST\u2019\u2018[New York City] tells us that they're trying\u2026 but, you know, at the end of the day, it's the same old stuff,\u2019 Dario told DailyMail.com. \u2018The pandemic and everything really put a damper on things in respect to the safety of trains, because it was already s**t.\u2019Indeed, subway crime rose dramatically during the pandemic, though it is still less dangerous than it was during the 1980s and 1990s - decades that saw more than two dozen murders every year.",
        "That said, the underground carnage is difficult to write off. There were 10 murders on the train last year, compared to about two murders annually over the last five years prior to the pandemic.One New Yorker said she felt so unsafe, and so distrustful of police that she wants to arm herself.\u2018At this point\u2026 we should be allowed to walk around with the weapons because it is very dangerous,\u2019 said Moody, from Brooklyn.\u2018I've had situations where I've always been attacked by men on the street late at night, and I feel like the police are not doing their best patrolling way to keep us safe.\u2019",
        "\u2018The police are clearly not helping us, our system is not working, I feel like the only people who can protect us is us,\u2019 she told DailyMail.com.For now, the investigation into the incident is ongoing and an attorney for Daniel Penny tells DailyMail.com they have contacted the DA's Office and the NYPD to cooperate.But regardless of the outcome of this case, New Yorkers certainly believe that the dangers they regularly face have not been addressed."
