        "May 7 (Reuters) - Olympique Lyonnais beat Montpellier 5-4 with a 100th-minute winner from the penalty spot after Alexandre Lacazette and Elye Wahi scored four goals each in an entertaining Ligue 1 match on Sunday.",
        "Lacazette opened the scoring just after the half-hour mark before Wahi scored four goals in the span of 15 minutes either side of halftime to give the visitors a 4-1 lead.Lacazette responded with two more goals to complete his hat-trick while Croatian defender Dejan Lovren also got on the score sheet as Lyon erased the three-goal cushion to make it 4-4.The French striker then stepped up for a spot kick in the 10th minute of injury time to fire his effort into the top corner for his fourth goal to spark wild celebrations at the Groupama Stadium.Lacazette's four goals propelled him to the top of the Ligue 1 goal-scoring chart with 24 strikes, one ahead of Kylian Mbappe who could reclaim his place at the top when Paris St Germain play Troyes later on Sunday.The game marked only the second time in France's top division that both teams had one player score at least four goals after Carlos Bianchi scored five for Reims in an 8-4 victory over AS Monaco, for whom Delio Onnis scored four, in May 1974.
