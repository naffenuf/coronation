As we gain life experience, we often realise that we need to unlearn some of what we were taught! We never stop learning and discovering. You\u2019re wondering whether you\u2019re prepared enough to deal with your situation. You\u2019re worried you\u2019ll \u2018get it wrong\u2019. But the only person judging you is\u2026 you! Why are you being so hard on yourself? This week, a problem only matters if you think it matters. Investigate more before making a decision.\u00a0The Coronation Eclipse brings positive potential! For great news, call 0906 751 5601.\u00a0TAURUSApril 21- May 21\u00a0We\u2019re not always as nice to each other as we could and should be. We complain and criticise, coax and cajole. Then wonder why our relationships aren\u2019t as healthy and fulfilling as we\u2019d like them to be! Or why we\u2019re surrounded by tension and angst. One of the reasons we treat others badly is because we\u2019re too harsh on ourselves. This week, as your ruler changes signs, inspiring events come along. As you get more comfy with your own abilities, your connections with others will grow sweeter and happier.\u00a0It\u2019s Coronation Eclipse week! Be guided to the future you dream of. For great news, call 0906 751 5602.",
        "GEMINIMay 22 - June 22Power comes hand-in-hand with responsibility. And responsibility brings pressure. And pressure reduces our ability to focus. And when we\u2019re distracted we lose power. Which is perfect! Otherwise, we\u2019d achieve what we want once and forever. And then what would we do? We\u2019d be so bored. Be thankful that you\u2019re not all-powerful. And don\u2019t be sparing with the power you have. Not only do you have less responsibility (in a tricky situation) than you imagine; you\u2019ve got less of a problem than you think.\u00a0How will the Coronation Eclipse transform your life? There\u2019s inspiration in your forecast. Call 0906 751 5603.\u00a0CANCERJune 23 - July 23In order to vastly improve your life you don\u2019t have to take dramatic action. You just have to do something that\u2019s almost too simple. You need to accept a change you\u2019re trying to oppose. Or let go of a dream you don\u2019t really believe in. As Venus moves into your sign, a decisive development is about to take place. It will liberate you from a state of doubt and expedite much-needed progress. Your task is to accept what seems to be rolling in so fast \u2013 and let go of whatever is keen to roll out of your life. You\u2019ll like what happens next!\u00a0",

Yet this week, your ability to rise above conflict and fear won\u2019t be as consistent as usual. It\u2019s likely that you will feel under pressure and frazzled. Although your strength will be tested, you\u2019ll find it easy to pass this test. By demonstrating patience and forgiveness (with yourself as well as others) you\u2019ll open the way for other people to offer you the support you so freely give. Hooray!\u00a0",

In these moments, we get so caught up in the cycle that we forget life can sometimes be straightforward, with a clear, obstacle-free path ahead. We almost expect disappointments.

        "SCORPIOOctober 24 - November 22Sometimes life seems short and sometimes it feels long. Some moments are over in the blink of an eye, while others seem to take an eternity. Our perception of the passage of time is subjective. So is our view of what\u2019s important. Despite the pressure you feel subject to, the doubts you\u2019re experiencing and the frustration you are starting to feel, this week brings tangible proof of why exactly the right amount of time is being taken, and the right result is about to be attained.

For good news, call 0906 751 5608.SAGITTARIUSNovember 23 - December 21Those fairytales we heard as kids (and watch on Disney films) have a lot to answer for. Princes and princesses. Gleaming castles. Magical forests. Ogres, giants and wish-granting genies. We\u2019re subjected to so many of these stories that we start to believe in them. But they can\u2019t be true\u2026 can they? This certainly isn\u2019t going to be a happy-ever-after week. But I\u2019d like to predict a \u2018much-happier-than-you-have-been\u2019 time. It will come about through a series of unlikely events.

Shadows are replaced by colours. It\u2019s astonishing how much our perception can be altered by a little information. Even though it can reveal faults that were indiscernible, knowledge is always valuable. This week, as your ruler, Saturn, links to Mercury and Venus, your understanding of a difficult situation improves. It brings you closer to making a life-changing decision.",
