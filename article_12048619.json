        "TV providers insisting on imposing high costs for publishers to access footageDespite outlets reaching\u00a0agreement with the Royal Household to use imagesMajor broadcasters were last night accused of continuing to hold UK news publishers to ransom over access to live footage of the Coronation, even though publishing outlets have now reached an agreement with the Royal Household to use the livestream.",
        "Despite publishers being given the go-ahead by the monarchy to use images from tomorrow, TV providers, including the BBC, ITN and Sky, continue to insist on imposing high costs to access the footage.\u00a0This has led to claims that they are trying to cash in on the historic event, rather than let it be seen as widely as possible.\u00a0It is also at odds with the precedent set at the Queen\u2019s funeral when British newspaper websites were given free access to the \u2018pooled\u2019 footage.A deal between the News Media Association, which represents UK national, regional and local news groups, and the Royal Household, says publishers would use the footage respectfully but there is frustration at the broadcasters\u2019 high fees for it.",
        "Earlier this week one industry executive said: \u2018We are being held to ransom.\u2019Insiders have said it is \u2018wrong\u2019 for the BBC to be \u2018seeking to profit\u2019 from coverage it will already be making, when sharing it with others would not involve any extra cost.They added that news publishers wanted to \u2018serve their existing readership\u2019 given the \u2018public interest of this historic occasion\u2019.A joint statement by the BBC, Sky and ITN previously said: \u2018UK broadcasters are investing heavily in the coverage of this complex and historic event and have asked for a fair and reasonable financial contribution from any third parties wishing to access the live coverage for their own use.\u2019"
