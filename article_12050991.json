Send your pictures and videos to pictures@mailonline.co.uk\u00a0King Charles III is\u00a0travelling to his coronation\u00a0in a sleek, air-conditioned coach, however, he will return to Buckingham Palace in its 200-year-old counterpart.",
        "Charles and Camilla arrived at Westminster Abbey at 11am in the Diamond Jubilee State Coach.This modern coach was originally meant to commemorate Queen Elizabeth II's 80th birthday, but its construction was delayed and so it was instead made to mark 60 years of her reign in 2012.\u00a0However, the King and Queen Consort\u00a0made the return journey to Buckingham Palace in the even grander Gold State Coach, used at the coronation of every monarch since William IV in 1831.King Charles's decision to choose the Diamond Jubilee State Coach for today's procession up to Westminster Abbey is a break from tradition but is thought to be a nod to his late mother because it was the last coach made during her reign.Here, MailOnline compares the Gold State Coach to the Diamond Jubilee State Coach, detailing all you need to know ahead of today's coronation proceedings...",
        "AgeThe Gold State Coach\u00a0Now over 260 years old, having been built for King George III in 1762, the Gold State Coach's first\u00a0outing was for his Opening of Parliament on 25 November 1762.Only the monarch and their consort are permitted to travel in the gilded carriage.The older coach has survived through two World Wars and yet it still looks almost exactly the same now as it was when it was originally built.",
        "The Gold State Coach is the third oldest surviving coach in Britain, following the Speaker of the House of Common\u2019s Coach which is the oldest dating from 1698 and the Lord Mayor of London\u2019s Coach was built in 1758.The Gold State Coach\u00a0has been used at every coronation since William IV\u2019s 1831 - a tradition the King is not looking to break today.The Diamond Jubilee State CoachThe Diamond Jubilee State Coach, on the other hand, was built in Australia by Jim Frecklington and then bought by the Royal Collection Trust. It was finished in 2010, but due to funding issues it did not arrive in London until March 2014.Yet, while it may be a newer build, the interior wooden panels of the coach are made from objects donated by more than 100 historic sites and organisations from across Britain.The window frames and interior panels include material from the Tower of London, Westminster Abbey, Balmoral, Kensington Palace Caenarfon Castle, Canterbury Cathedral, the Mary Rose (Henry VIII's flagship), 10 Downing Street and the Antarctic bases of Captain Scott and Sir Ernest Shackleton.The seat handrails are from the Royal Yacht Britannia, the vessel that was beloved by the Queen until it was retired from royal service in 1997.The coach also incudes a fragment of the bronze cannon from which every Victoria Cross is cast, and a piece of metal from the wreckage of a 617 Squadron Dambuster.",
        "SizeThe Gold State Coach\u00a0The iconic gilded carriage, which is 23feet long (seven metres) and stands at 12feet (three point seven metres), weights almost four tons and is pulled by eight horses.Due to its age and weight, this carriage only ever travels at walking pace.\u00a0But while Queen Elizabeth II had to endure a two-hour, five-mile route back to the palace via Regent Street, Oxford Street and Park Lane, her son and heir has decided on a much more direct procession via Whitehall, Admiralty Arch and The Mall.\u00a0Martin Oates, senior carriage restorer at the Royal Mews, will walk behind the four-tonne carriage in the King's coronation procession and act as the 'brake man' pulling the hand-held T-bar at the back to secure it in place when it stops.It will take 20 people to push it out of its permanent home in the Royal Mews into the courtyard ready for the coronation, and a window and a door will have to be removed to create enough space for the huge carriage to pass through into the open air.\u00a0",
        "The Diamond Jubilee State CoachThe newest coach at the Royal Mews, however,\u00a0is more than 16feet (five metres) long, weighs more than three tons and needs only six horses to pull it.",
        "Comfort\u00a0The Gold State CoachAt 260 years old, however, the Gold State Coach is 'not very comfortable', according to the late Queen. Elizabeth II spoke candidly about the coach in 2018, saying: 'Horrible. Not meant for travelling in at all.'I mean it's just not... it's only sprung on leather.'She described how, at her coronation in 1953, they travelled 'half way around London' in the carriage during the royal procession, covering around five miles at a walking pace.It has been reported that Royal Mews staff strapped a hot water bottle under the seat on the day of the Queen's coronation, because the day was unseasonably cold and wet.Queen Elizabeth was not the only monarch to not be particularly fond of this coach - Queen Victoria was also not a fan and, after the death of Prince Albert in 1861, did not make use of it again.",
        "Queen Victoria much preferred to use the more comfortable State Landau coach on subsequent occasions following her own Coronation Day, for instance for both her gold and diamond jubilees and her wedding.\u00a0The Diamond Jubilee State CoachWhile its unrivalled in how rich and beautiful it looks, the newer Diamond Jubilee State Coach combines traditional craftsmanship with the benefits of modern technology.",
        "Said to be one of the most comfortable royal coaches, it has an aluminium body, electric windows, air-conditioning and it is upholstered in yellow silk.What's more, it is prevented from swaying by six hydraulic stabilisers, while the gilded crown on top, carved from the oak of HMS Victory, can hold a camera to film journeys.Cost\u00a0The Gold State CoachThe Gold State Coach, built in 1762, was most recently used during Her Majesty's Platinum Jubilee celebrations in 2022 and was fitted for the day with a hologram of the monarch in the coach windows.Designed by William Chambers and made by Samuel Butler, the coach is made of giltwood, which is a thin layer of gold leaf over wood.\u00a0",
        "It features gilded sculptures including three cherubs on the roof, which represent England, Scotland, and Ireland, and above each wheel there is a massive triton figure.Also decorating the outside are incredibly ornate panels of Roman gods and goddesses painted by Giovanni Battista Cipriani.The Gold State Coach is the third oldest surviving coach in the UK, coming only after the Speaker of the House of Common's Coach, dating from 1698, and the Lord Mayor of London's Coach, built in 1758.\u00a0The Gold State Coach cost \u00a37,661, 18 shillings and 11 pennies when it was first built in 1762, which would be around \u00a32 million today.",
        "\u00a0The Diamond Jubilee State CoachThe Diamond Jubilee State Coach was purchased by the Royal Collection Trust for an undisclosed fee, paid by a private donation.There is also uncertainty around who commissioned the coach and how much for as the maker claimed it was endorsed by Buckingham Palace, but not commissioned.",
