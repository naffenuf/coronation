        "MADRID, May 3 (Reuters) - World number two Carlos Alcaraz stayed on course for his fourth title of 2023 by powering into the semi-finals of the Madrid Open with a 6-4 7-5 win over Russian Karen Khachanov on Thursday.Defending his title from last year, Alcaraz will be looking to celebrate his 20th birthday on Friday with a win against either Croatian Borna Coric or surprise German qualifier Daniel Altmaier in his sixth Masters 1000 event semi-final.Alcaraz managed to break the Russian's serve in the seventh game, closing the first set 6-4.However, the Spaniard began the second set a little distracted and allowed Khachanov to open up a 4-1 lead before he woke up to fight back and win the match in under two hours.\"Winning this match gives me a lot of confidence,\" Alcaraz said.\"Karen had been playing at a high level and took me to the limit, it was decided by small details.\"I will train for Friday, but with a lot of tranquillity and calm, I will not be overwhelmed and I have to be fresh.\"Alcaraz has reached 18 consecutive wins in Spanish clay-court tournaments since losing to Rafael Nadal in Madrid two years ago on his 19th birthday.His winning percentage overall on clay is already the third best since 2010 (82.3%), behind only Nadal and Novak Djokovic.",
