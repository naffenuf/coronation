        "Impersonator of Charles,\u00a0Guy Ingle, reveals he also poses as\u00a0Prince EdwardRead More:\u00a0I've been a Charles impersonator for decades and won't use the tube\u00a0A professional impersonator of King Charles\u00a0revealed that not only does he pose as the monarch, but also his younger brother Prince Edward.",
        "Guy Ingle, 63, an entertainer from Ampthill, Bedfordshire, joined Kate Garraway and Ben Shephard on Good Morning Britain to speak about life impersonating his Royal Highness.\u00a0Guy,\u00a0who was sat next to Camilla impersonator Wendy Ellis, admitted that while he's busier than ever in the run up to the coronation, he's previously starring as Edward.He said: 'Years ago I was on This Morning on a Thursday as Prince Edward, and on the Tuesday as Prince Charles.'\u00a0Elsewhere, Guy, who has been mimicking Charles, 74, since the nineties, revealed Charles sent a security guard over to him with a message at a polo match years ago.",
        "The impersonator revealed His Majesty wished him 'good luck' when they first crossed paths.\u00a0He said: 'Some years ago, I actually turned up at a polo event when he did play polo and had to do a speech, and he played polo with his sons against the Argentinian polo team.'And what happened afterwards was I actually watched him play and then the awards, and a security man came over and said, 'Prince Charles has got a message for you. He said, 'good luck to you. You've got to earn a living.'However he admitted that the impersonator business\u00a0wasn't always as lucrative and he had to pick up other jobs to get by.\u00a0",
        "He said: 'But I have to do other things as well to make a living, like during Covid, we have to do whatever, in between jobs I've worked in a caf\u00e9, I've done bar work, I've done everything.'\u00a0While in the run up to the Coronation, he has seen his workload quadruple.Guy previously said: 'Work has never been so busy since the Queen's death as Charles is now king. Meaning I no longer play a second-fiddle character to the Queen.",
        "'The workload has quadrupled, but I never let myself get dragged into any inappropriate gigs as I've got far too much respect for the royal family to do so.'I've always been a huge fan of the royals, my family were always huge supporters of them.'We were all hugely saddened by the news of the Queen's death, and I think the stress with Harry and Andrew must not have helped her I feel in her later years.'Guy - who says he doesn't use the tube because of the stares he gets from the public - has also revealed how he operates in his unusual role.He said: 'I have the same approach for majority of my gigs as King Charles.'I get my agents to give me info on the person who's booked me and what the event is so I can tailor the routine.",
        "'I learn the script and get my costume ready, I practice my lines whilst in getting the make-up done and then arrive at the venue in plenty of time.'But I rarely use the tube to avoid stares and questions from the public as I often get stopped by them.'Guy added that the best work he has ever done was in Los Angeles.He said, 'The best experience I've ever had was when I was working in Los Angeles, on the set of the Superhero Movie in 2008 with the late, great Leslie Nielsen.'I was treated like a star out there, limo trips and a five-star hotel to then be moved to an apartment in Beverley Hills.'",
        "But achieving success has not come easy to Guy.He said, 'The reason I got into this line of work was because I knew I could do better than most impersonators or lookalike.'But he added that he had many rejections.He said: 'I had constant rejection in the nineties until I finally started getting jobs with other impersonators such as Diana and the Queen.'He also lost much work in the pandemic, so his revenue increase has come as a boost."
