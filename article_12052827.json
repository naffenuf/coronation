        "I'm A Celebrity South Africa viewers took to Twitter on Friday to slam Janice Dickinson, 68, and Carol Vorderman 62, after they both refused to take part in the gold-mine Bushtucker trial.",
        "In the latest episode of the show, the camp had to split up into two teams consisting of the yellow team and the green team and were pitted against each other.Both the team captains - Joe Swash and Dean Gaffney - were forced to choose two contestants to take part in the trial.However, before the trial, hosts Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnolly revealed a cruel twist to the campmates by announcing that whichever two lost would be sent home.The green team captain Joe Swash, 41, first decided to ask his team for volunteers and tried to ask Janice.",
        "However, Janice refused to take part, while Carol, who also didn't volunteer, said she was 'not happy' with the end choice as it could mean the exit of two strong team members.After asking the camp members who wanted to volunteer Joe then proceeded to pick Andy, 42, and Toff, 28, who appeared enthusiastic, while the yellow team captain picked Jordan, 33, and Myleene, 45.The four then had to take part in the Gold Rush trial, in which they had to find gold nuggets buried inside identical mine shafts.\u00a0The object of the game was to find the nuggets and place them on scales at entrance to the mine, with each team having to find enough\u00a0nuggets to tip the scales and win a picnic for their team - with the losers going home.",
        "As the scenes played out on screen, fans were quick to take to Twitter to share their rage by criticising Janice and Carol for their behaviour ahead of the Bushtucker trial.\u00a0One angry viewer wrote: 'Janice and Carol letting their egos get in the way of putting themselves forward for the trial.'While another penned 'Carol coming out with that as if she isn't the liability of her team.'Other viewers were also quick to jump on the bandwagon by sharing comical tweets.",
        "One viewer said 'Carol wanting to disappear under a rock, not wanting to be picked... (laughing emoji) #ImACeleb.'While another wrote 'Janice not wanting to do a trial not surprised #ImACeleb #imacelebrity.'More fans of the show were also left feeling enraged by I'm A Celeb's cruel twists throughout the episode.As s soon as things began to heat up with the competition, the show then abruptly ended, so the results would not be announced until Monday.Viewers were far from impressed with the 'cruel' twist as they took to Twitter to vent their fury, with one even asking: 'What are you playing at?!'",
        "'Making us wait till Monday?!' fumed one person, while another questioned: 'What you mean NEXT TIME ???!''Literally ending it on a cliffhanger like that and we won't even find out until Monday. Nah. Livid' ranted a third.",
        "'Leaving it there and making us wait till Monday..cruel' fumed a fourth person.Another angry viewer asked: 'WHAT ARE YOU PLAYING AT?!'With an additional person adding: 'Tell us what's happening as cannot wait until Monday as it will do my head in.'The four had to take part in the Gold Rush trial, in which they had to find gold nuggets buried inside identical mine shafts.The object of the game was to find the nuggets and place them on scales at the entrance to the mine, and each team had to find enough nuggets to tip the scale and win the picnic for their team.It was a closely fought race, with Georgia and Andy initially taking the lead while Myleene struggled to find any nuggets as Jordan ploughed ahead.",
        "But things evened up when Myleene began to find her nuggets, with the competition seriously heating up as the stars desperately fought to come out on top.However, viewers will have to wait and see which two stars would be packing their bags.I'm A Celebrity...South Africa continues Monday at 9pm on ITV1 and ITVX."
