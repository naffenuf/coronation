        "A former BBC Trust chairman has suggested that there could be merit in reforming how the next chair of the broadcaster is appointed, following the resignation of Richard Sharp.",
        "Mr Sharp\u2019s resignation from the position came after he was found to have broken the rules by failing to disclose he played a part in getting Boris Johnson an \u00a3800,000 loan guarantee.Lord Patten, who said that Mr Sharp did the \u201cright and sensible\u201d thing in quitting following a report by barrister Adam Heppinstall KC, was asked on BBC Radio 4\u2019s World At One programme whether the Government should have the last word on who chairs the broadcaster.\u201cI think the case has been made very strongly and very well that the Government should go along with the idea to have a sort of all-party basis for making an appointment.\u201cBut on the whole, chairmen of the BBC have done pretty good jobs, even though very few of them have been in a position where they could help secure a loan for the Prime Minister.\u201dThe role is currently decided through an open competition of candidates who are interviewed by an advisory panel, but the Prime Minister ultimately has the final say.",
        "On Mr Sharp, the peer said: \u201cI do think that his view of what constituted a perception of a conflict of interest, and the perception that I would have and many others would have, and that the select committee of the House of Commons would have\u2026 I think there is a difference there, which would have always been rather difficult to bridge.",
        "\u201cSo, I think he did the right and sensible thing.\u201dLord Patten, who chaired the BBC Trust between 2011 and 2014, said he hoped that the controversy had not damaged trust in the BBC.\u201cOne of the things which is most important for the future of an open society, of a liberal society in this country, is to continue to have a world-renowned public service broadcaster, and it\u2019s really important that we continue to defend it and we give it more money to do what is an incredibly important job,\u201d he said."
