        "Wasps owner Chris Holland is keen to secure a lease to play at Sixways\u00a0But if loan is not repaid in 21 days then Wasps could relocate to Solihull MoorsAlso could lead to sale of Sixways for land value and official end of Worcester\u00a0Fresh doubts have emerged over the long-term future of Worcester, despite the Atlas Group\u2019s takeover of the Warriors being completed this week.",
        "Mail Sport understands that Atlas took a \u00a31.15million loan from Wasps owner Chris Holland, who is keen to secure a lease for his club to play at Worcester\u2019s former Sixways home.However, the loan is understood to only be for 21 days, and the fact Atlas had to borrow such a large sum to meet an RFU deadline to complete their purchase of Worcester raises significant alarm bells.It is understood that if Atlas can\u2019t repay their loan to Holland in the 21-day period, then Wasps will walk away from playing at Sixways and look to relocate to National League football club Solihull Moors.\u00a0That would likely lead to the sale of Sixways for land value and the official end of Worcester, rendering the Atlas takeover irrelevant.",
        "Meanwhile, England back Elliot Daly will make his Saracens comeback today, having been out of action since January with a hamstring injury.\u00a0Daly is yet to feature under England coach Steve Borthwick but is hoping to impress before next month\u2019s World Cup training camp.Daly will co-captain Saracens from full back, in the absence of rested Owen Farrell, who was yesterday nominated for Premiership player of the season alongside Rob du Preez, Ollie Lawrence and Jasper Wiese."
