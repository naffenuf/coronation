As I say, the last time I watched it, it was in black and white,\" said Mike Davies, who sat at the Queen Victoria pub, referring to the coronation of Charles\u00b4 mother, Queen Elizabeth II, in 1953.The response to Charles is in stark contrast to just eight months ago, when people lined up in front of the British Consulate General to lay flowers and pay tribute to Elizabeth.The city, which was under British rule for more than a century, was handed back to China in 1997.LONDON - The environmental activism group Just Stop Oil says around 20 of its supporters were arrested Saturday for protesting during the coronation celebrations.The group, which demands no new licenses for any fossil fuel projects in the U.K., said that the protesters were arrested on the Mall outside Buckingham Palace and outside Downing Street.It said the activists did not carry out disruptive action, and that they were only wearing \"Just Stop Oil\" T-shirts and holding flags with the slogan.",

So help me God,\" William said.Traditionally royals and lords will also kneel before their new monarch and pay homage, but this time that\u00b4s replaced by what officials have called \"The People\u00b4s Homage\" - people watching at home who wish to do so are invited to say \"God save King Charles\" at the end, or follow the words of the liturgy.LONDON - King Charles III has been crowned in his solemn coronation service and the congregation has cheered \"God save the king.\"The Archbishop of Canterbury placed the hefty gold and jewel-studded St. Edward\u00b4s crown on the head of Charles midway through the two-hour service. The crowning is the centerpiece of the coronation and it\u00b4s the only time during his reign that Charles will wear the solid gold crown.It features a purple velvet cap, ermine band and criss-crossed arches topped by a cross. It\u00b4s set with rubies, amethysts, sapphires, garnet, topazes and tourmalines.After the ceremony, Charles will swap the 2.08-kilogram (4.6-pound) crown for the Imperial State Crown, which weighs about half as much, for the procession back to Buckingham Palace.LONDON - King Charles III is preparing for his anointment, the most sacred and intimate part of the coronation rituals.Charles and Camilla will remove their crimson Robes of State and the king will be dressed in a white linen tunic and the \"Supertunica,\" a full-length gold coat - garments that symbolize both humility and splendor, meant to reflect the two natures of Jesus Christ.He will sit in the ancient oak Coronation Chair, which has been part of every coronation since 1308.

He later kissed the holy book.The service has been modified to acknowledge the change in the religious makeup of the United Kingdom.For the first time, Buddhist, Hindu, Jewish, Muslim and Sikh religious leaders are playing a part in the coronation. That reflects Charles\u00b4 vow to be \"the defender of faiths,\" as opposed to the \"defender of the faith.\"LONDON - For his coronation, King Charles III is wearing the crimson velvet Robe of State, which was worn by King George VI at his coronation in 1937. He is also wearing a crimson tunic, cream silk overshirt, and Royal Navy trousers.Camilla, the queen consort, is also wearing a crimson robe, this one originally made for Queen Elizabeth II in 1953.
