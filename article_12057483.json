        "Lionel Richie has said he thinks the King will bring a \u201cnew flavour\u201d and his \u201camazing sense of humour\u201d to the role of monarch before taking to the stage at the Coronation Concert.",
        "The US singer, who was one of the celebrity guests at the coronation service on Saturday, performed his hit tracks Easy and All Night Long at the celebratory event held in the grounds of Windsor Castle on Sunday evening.His appearance prompted a royal singalong and huge applause from the King and Queen who joined around 20,000 members of the public at the event to continue the celebrations after their crowning at Westminster Abbey.",
        "Reflecting on Charles\u2019 new role backstage ahead of his performance, Richie told the PA news agency: \u201cI think he\u2019s going to bring a new flavour.\u201cI\u2019m going say this to you honestly, a lot of people don\u2019t know this about him, but he has an amazing sense of humour that we haven\u2019t seen yet, so I think we may in the future see a little bit of a glimpse of that \u2013 and of course, inclusiveness.\u201dRichie revealed that he immediately jumped at the chance to perform at the celebratory concert, saying: \u201cThe answer no matter what you had planned for that day, the answer is yes right away. And then the second thing that comes up is you start thinking: \u2018Well, wait a minute, what am I going to wear?'\u201dThe singer admitted he did initially question if it was a joke but felt \u201chonoured\u201d when it was confirmed to be true.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s an honour because it\u2019s every 80 years, except for the Queen who just took it all the way to the end. But I mean, this is amazing,\u201d he said.",
        "Richie added that he had a chance to speak to Charles ahead of the event and revealed he was \u201cso happy\u201d and \u201creally looking forward\u201d to the concert.\u201cHe\u2019s throwing a party, think about that. This is unusual. I understand this has not happened this often where you have this kind of thing after the big one. So I\u2019m very happy about this. He\u2019s very loose,\u201d he added.As Richie took to the stage to perform a rendition of his track Easy, it prompted a singalong throughout the audience including including the King and Queen.Zara and Mike Tindall could be seen singing along to the song, with some swaying from the Duke of Edinburgh.The crowd amplified further when he struck up the chords to his classic song All Night Long, causing Prince George to dance and wave his flag alongside his sister Charlotte.The King himself also got to his feet to dance \u2013 as did the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh."
