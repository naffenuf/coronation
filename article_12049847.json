        "A record-breaking owner of one of the largest collections of royal memorabilia in the world has flown from rural Australia to join the crowds in London during the King\u2019s coronation.",
        "Jan Hugo, 64, owns more than 10,000 objects honouring the royal family and has known for months that she would be flying across the world for the \u201conce-in-a-lifetime\u201d event, she told the PA news agency.Starting in the early 1980s with a coin commemorating the engagement of Charles and his late wife Diana, Ms Hugo has amassed thousands of collectibles dating back to Queen Victoria\u2019s reign, which she displays in her home in Nulkaba in New South Wales.",
        "Ms Hugo, who owns Australia\u2019s largest collection of royal memorabilia, also used her trip to the UK as an opportunity to meet Anita Atkinson, whose museum in Crook, County Durham, houses more than 12,000 items.Ms Hugo said Ms Atkinson \u201cgave me a big hug as soon as I got out of the car\u201d and showed her Aussie counterpart objects from her impressive collection, which Ms Hugo said was a \u201clovely\u201d experience.Ms Hugo explained that she had sent Ms Atkinson a Christmas card and a letter and the English collector got in touch with her and said \u201ccome on up\u201d.She said: \u201cThere\u2019s no way I will ever catch up to her because she gets things here for a couple of pounds and for me to get things in Australia, it could be 200 dollars for the same thing.\u201d",
        "Ms Hugo\u2019s house holding her collectibles \u2013 which she said is \u201cjust like being in a museum\u201d \u2013 opened up to visitors in 2014, before closing after the Covid-19 pandemic meant it \u201cjust wasn\u2019t worth it anymore\u201d.Ms Hugo said tourists would sometimes tell her and her husband David, 66, about their memories of past royal celebrations and the couple was inspired to be among the crowds for the coronation.She said: \u201cSome of the older people would tell us they remembered Elizabeth\u2019s coronation when they were little children or, you know, their parents went to the coronation.\u201cWe thought, this is our chance now to be a part of history so we can tell our grandchildren that we were there.\u201d",
        "After travelling to England in 2011, Ms Hugo and her husband had been planning for a long time to fly back to the United Kingdom and saw the coronation of Charles as the perfect time to come.She said that the morning the date of the coronation was announced \u201cwe were on the phone booking the flights and the accommodation\u201d.She added: \u201cWe\u2019ll be too old when William becomes king so it was now or never.\u201d",
        "Reflecting on the king\u2019s reign so far, she said: \u201cHe certainly had someone who knew what they were doing, and he\u2019s followed in her footsteps so I can\u2019t see why he won\u2019t be a good king.\u201d",
        "She added: \u201cWith all the issues that people have had with Camilla, I think it might be really nice to show that she\u2019s now our queen and we should have a little bit more respect for her.\u201dNot letting the celebrations distract her from growing her collection further, Ms Hugo said she has gathered a \u201csuitcase full\u201d of more royal memorabilia to take back to Australia."
