        "Claire Aris says she could not believe it when she looked down and saw the Monarch staring back at her.The 49-year-old thinks the drink's residue looks like the King's side profile.The mother made her discovery in a Sainsbury's carpark, after buying the shake at a Plymouth store.Claire described her find as 'amazing'.",
        "She said: 'I thought today might be a good time to tell you of my amazing find of King Charles on the lid of my Banana smoothie.'I was just sat in Sainsbury's car park with my daughter and I looked down and immediately said, 'Oh my God, it's King Charles!''This was a while ago, back when we lost the Queen. But I posted it to Facebook and all my friends were telling me to go to the newspapers and now of course it's gone a bit mad with the Coronation I thought it would be the right time.'The image is similar to how King Charles is seen on newly issued coins, which entered circulation in December.The only difference is that in this picture the he is looking to his right, much like his late mother, Queen Elizabeth II, did on her currency.The latest coins show the King looking to his left as is royal tradition when one monarch takes over from another.",
        "When asked if she saw his appearance on her smoothie lid as a sign of something, Claire replied: 'Not really, no.'"
