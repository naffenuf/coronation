        "The Tasmanian government is pushing for the new $715 million Hobart stadium and redevelopment of the surrounding area to be fast-tracked.",
        "The Macquarie Point development will be nominated as a major project under legislation allowing an independent expert panel to assess the masterplan, rather than the local council.The Tasmanian Planning Commission used the same process to approve the Bridgewater Bridge project.State Development Minister Guy Barnett said the process took politics out of the decision-making process and allowed projects to be assessed on their own merits.\"Tasmanians can be assured that if declared a major project that there would be an independent process that is rigorous and which provides genuine opportunities for community engagement,\" he said.The government says the process still allows for public input and the planning minister will consult with a range of interested parties.Last week, the AFL awarded Tasmania the 19th team licence, with the men's team slated to join the competition by 2028, while details on an AFLW team are still being worked through.The controversial stadium development will get a $240 million funding injection from the federal government, while the Tasmanian government will pitch in $375 million.The remainder will come from the AFL and commercial land sales.Opponents of the development argue the choice of site is poor and the money would be better spent on housing amid a growing number of homeless people and financially stretched households in the island state."
