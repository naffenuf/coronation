        "Newcastle defender Dan Burn had no complaints over Arsenal\u2019s streetwise tactics after a tooth-and-nail Premier League battle at St James\u2019 Park.",
        "The Gunners emerged from Sunday\u2019s fiercely-contested encounter on Tyneside with a 2-0 victory on an afternoon when anything less would have all but handed the title to leaders Manchester City.In doing so, they dealt a blow to the Magpies\u2019 Champions League qualification hopes in a game punctuated by frequent delays in play and ill-tempered confrontations which prevented the home side from establishing a rhythm, something they themselves had been accused of doing in the reverse fixture at the Emirates Stadium in January.But, asked about Arsenal\u2019s approach, Burn said: \u201cOf course it\u2019s frustrating, but that\u2019s what they said we did at their place. We get a lot of stick for slowing the game down, which I don\u2019t know if we intentionally do all the time.\u201cThey did that, but it\u2019s part and parcel of football. We can\u2019t do it and then complain when it happens to us.\u201cA lot of teams tend to do that now when they feel the energy of the crowd, they try and stifle it a little bit.\u201cWhen a team like Arsenal is coming here and doing that, it\u2019s a compliment.\u201d",
        "Newcastle set off with high hopes of repeating their 2-0 home win over the Gunners last season and might have been on their way in front of an expectant home crowd had Jacob Murphy\u2019s early shot not come back off a post or had referee Chris Kavanagh not been advised to review his decision to award a penalty for handball against Jakub Kiwior.",
        "In the event, they were undone by Martin Odegaard\u2019s first-half strike and Fabian Schar\u2019s unfortunate own goal.Burn said: \u201cWe knew it wasn\u2019t going to be the same as last season, where we played them off the park. They\u2019re a lot better this year and they\u2019ve shown that all season.\u201cThey\u2019ve been unlucky that City have overtaken them, but they\u2019re a very good team who caused us problems, especially at home. We\u2019re just unfortunate we couldn\u2019t get the win.\u201d We\u2019re disappointed, but we\u2019ve got four games to go and it\u2019s still in our hands  Newcastle defender Dan Burn  Manchester United\u2019s defeat at West Ham means Newcastle remain two points clear in third place with four games remaining, although with Liverpool and Brighton making concerted bids to reel them in.Burn said: \u201cWe\u2019re disappointed, but we\u2019ve got four games to go and it\u2019s still in our hands.\u201d"
