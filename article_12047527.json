        "By Kelsi KarruliMay the force - fourth - be with you! May 4 has been branded Star Wars Day and time for fans of the franchise to celebrate the film with special deals and more.\u00a0A long time ago in a galaxy far far away, the Star Wars universe featured just a few films. Now the franchise is still growing, with 12 movies, including spinoffs, and nine TV shows.\u00a0And while movie lovers gush over the sci fi series all year round, there is one special day in the month of May that became National Star Wars Day because of the phrase, 'May the force be with you,' which was used by Jedi masters in the movies.The influence of George Lucas - the Star Wars creator - on pop culture is undeniable, with thousands of fans coming together on May 4 to celebrate. And the benefits of the special day go beyond its meme-y origins, with many retailers offering Star Wars lovers special deals on top-selling products.\u00a0Why is May 4th called Star Wars day?\u00a0Although many fans believe the fourth day of May became Star Wars day due to the turn of the phrase, 'May the force be with you,' it was primarily because of a general election.\u00a0According to Lucasfilm, the iconic slogan was initially switched around in 1978 as a way to greet others on the Fourth of July.\u00a0The emphasis on Star Wars on the fourth of the month of May can actually be traced back to the 1979 UK general election.\u00a0",
        "The following year, in 1979, May 4 became the unofficial day of the fandom when\u00a0Margaret Thatcher became Britain's first female prime minister.\u00a0To celebrate her success, her party bought a half-page ad in the May 4, 1979, edition of The London Evening News.\u00a0The issue read: 'May the fourth be with you, Maggie. Congratulations!'\u00a0And because May the fourth be with you doesn't have the same ring to it in other languages, the term Star Wars Day was adopted.\u00a0It was observed as a day for the fandom for decades, however, it wasn't until 2019 that it was officially recognized.In 2019, California lawmakers voted to declare May 4 National Star Wars Day in honor of Disney's Galaxy Edge opening.\u00a0May is also a memorable month for fans of the franchise.\u00a0The original Star Wars premiered on May 25, 1977, and George Lucas's birthday is May 14.\u00a0Get ready to laugh!
