        "The American singer, 38, relaxed with the fashion designer, 51, ahead of her performance at Windsor Castle and shared some videos to Instagram.Speaking in a strong English accent, Katy asked Stella her opinion on the ongoing debate on whether milk should be added before or after removing the tea bag when enjoying a brew.The musician, who is married to Kent-born actor Orlando Bloom, asked her followers to discuss the age-old debate in the comments and said to blame her husband.\u00a0Sparking the discussion, she questioned: 'Do I put the bag in, or do I take it out before the milk?'",
        "'Take it out before the milk,' Stella confirmed.\u00a0Moving on, Katy then asked: 'Do we put put jam or cream on the scone first?'After correcting her pronunciation of scone, the designer responded: 'Clotted cream first, double clotted cream, because if you don't the jam squishes off.'Katy captioned the clip: 'Hard hitting q\u2019s from backstage with Stella McCartney at the Coronation Concert on the BBC and\u00a0PBS for us \u2018mericans.
