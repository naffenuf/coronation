        "Harry Kane has become the Premier League's second all-time leading goalscorerThe England captain scored Tottenham's opening goal against Crystal PalaceKane's 209th Premier League strike see's him overtake Wayne Rooney\u00a0Harry Kane has overtaken Wayne Rooney to become the Premier League's second all-time record goalscorer after his strike put Tottenham in front against Crystal Palace on Saturday.",
        "The England captain scored his 209th Premier League goal to jump ahead of former Manchester United\u00a0and Three Lions star striker Rooney.Kane achieved the feat in 317 appearances for Tottenham, 174 games fewer than Rooney and is now second in the top-flight record books behind only Alan Shearer.\u00a0The 29-year-old is just 51 goals behind Shearer's leading 260 Premier League strikes and will be looking to close in further on his fellow countryman's tally between now and the end of the season.Kane got the leap on Palace defenders in the box to guide Pedro Porro's cross past Sam Johnstone on the stroke of half-time as Spurs took the lead to keep the pressure on teams above them currently occupying the division's Champions League qualification spots.",
        "Shearer has held the record since retiring in 2006 and scored 260 goals in 441 appearances during spells playing for Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle United.\u00a0Saturday's headed effort moves Kane onto 25 Premier League goals for the season during what has been a turbulent campaign for Spurs both domestically and in Europe.He is now 10 adrift of Manchester City's Erling Haaland who broke the record for most goals during a single Premier League season in his side's mid-week win over West Ham.Kane scored his first English top-flight goal for Tottenham in 2014 during a 5-1 win over Sunderland after being handed his first start in the division by Tim Sherwood.",
        "The Englishman then wrapped up his 100th and 101st strike in 2018 when Spurs came from behind to draw 2-2 with Liverpool at Anfield.",
        "He then became only the third player to score 200 Premier League goals when Tottenham beat Man City in February.The Tottenham talisman also broke the record books for England earlier this year when he became the nation's all-time leading goalscorer.However, Kane's future looks uncertain as he prepares to enter the final year of his Tottenham contract and is wanted by rival clubs in England and across Europe.Manchester United are interested in bringing Kane to Old Trafford, with Erik ten Hag keen to address his side's need for a centre forward."
