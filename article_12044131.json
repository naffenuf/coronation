        "No colt has won the Triple Crown \u2014 the 2,000 Guineas, Derby and St Leger \u2014 since Nijinsky in 1970. But O\u2019Brien went close in 2012 with Camelot, who was runner-up in the St Leger after winning the first two legs.Auguste Rodin, the 2,000 Guineas 13-8 favourite who is expected to be ridden by Ryan Moore, looks to have guaranteed stamina.His sire was the great Japanese middle-distance champion Deep Impact while his dam Rhododendron, the 2018 Lockinge Stakes winner, finished second to Enable in the 2017 Oaks.But it is his speed that will be tested over a mile at Newmarket. Asked if the race might be the toughest of the Triple Crown for Auguste Rodin to win, O\u2019Brien said: \u2018It definitely will be. The shortest he would be bred to get is a mile but we feel it would not be fair to not give him the chance do it.",
        "\u2018He has a lot of similarities (with Camelot). It\u2019s class that those horses have, which comes out as a combination of stamina and speed.\u2018If they have too much stamina they are too slow and too much speed means they don\u2019t stay. Auguste Rodin has always exuded class from the very first time he worked.\u2019O\u2019Brien\u2019s other runner in the 2,000 Guineas, Little Big Bear, has a different profile to his stablemate. His speed is guaranteed but the question mark is his stamina and he will revert to sprinting if he doesn\u2019t stay."
