        "The world No 3 attracted criticism when he followed his disappointment at Augusta by quickly withdrawing from the RBC Heritage the next week.That decision has cost McIlroy an estimated $3million in Player Impact Program bonuses as the RBC is one of the PGA Tour's 'designated events', but in breaking his silence on Tuesday, the Northern Irishman pointed to the strains of his involvement in golf's civil war across the past year.Speaking at the Tour's Wells Fargo Championship, which commences on Thursday, McIlroy told the Golf Channel: 'More for my mental and emotional well-being I needed to be at home for those few weeks. I think I'm in a better head space than I was.'I needed a break for me. Obviously, after the disappointment of Augusta, and it's been a pretty taxing 12 months mentally, so it was nice to just try to disconnect and get away from it. But it's nice to come back and feel refreshed.",
        "'You know, that run-up to Augusta is always a stressful enough couple of weeks trying making sure everything's in the right order and making sure your game's in good shape.\u00a0'I think for me it was a nice reset because I still had to realise that there's three more majors this year, there's a ton left to play for.'",
        "McIlroy left Augusta without doing any interviews after falling far short of his goal of completing the career grand slam."
