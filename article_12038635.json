        "Partygate investigator Sue Gray declined to speak to an inquiry into her discussions with Labour about a senior party role, a Cabinet Office minister has said.",
        "The internal probe into her planned switch from her high-ranking Whitehall position to become Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s chief of staff has been paused \u201cwhilst we consider next steps\u201d, Oliver Dowden said.In a written statement to the House of Commons on Tuesday, he said it is up to the anti-corruption watchdog to recommend how long to delay the former senior official\u2019s start date with Labour. Ms Gray was given the opportunity to make representations as part of this process but chose not to do so  Oliver Dowden  Labour insisted that Ms Gray has \u201cfully co-operated\u201d with the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba)\u2019s separate review of the terms of her departure and new job offer.Deputy Prime Minister Mr Dowden noted that under Civil Service guidance, any contact between senior civil servants and leading members of opposition parties should be cleared by ministers.But he did not say whether the Cabinet Office deemed her to have broken rules, as had been suggested by several reports.The Cabinet Office has made submissions to Acoba, which will \u201cconsider evidence from a range of sources to make a recommendation on any appropriate restrictions on the appointment\u201d, the statement read.The watchdog can set recommendations for when senior people leave government, including calling for a cooling-off period to avoid any conflict of interest.",
        "Mr Dowden said the Cabinet Office process \u201cinvolved interviewing relevant persons\u201d to establish \u201cfurther details\u201d on any contact between Ms Gray and Sir Keir.\u201cI can update the House that Ms Gray was given the opportunity to make representations as part of this process but chose not to do so,\u201d he said.\u201cIn order to maintain confidentiality towards an individual former employee, I am unable at this stage to provide further information relating to the departure of Ms Gray whilst we consider next steps.\u201dA Labour source told the PA news agency: \u201cSue Gray has fully co-operated with the Acoba process and is awaiting their outcome. They are the designated channel in cases like this.\u201dDave Penman, leader of the FDA union which represents senior Whitehall staff, said Ms Gray \u201chas the right\u201d to prioritise the watchdog\u2019s deliberations and stressed that she is no longer a civil servant.He told Times Radio: \u201cAcoba is really the real deal when it comes to this and who\u2019s going to make a decision. And it really should be, because it isn\u2019t doing it for political ends. It\u2019s doing it based on evidence, and I can understand why she\u2019d prioritise that.\u201dThe Civil Service Code says officials of Ms Gray\u2019s seniority must wait a minimum of three months before taking up outside employment.",
        "But Acoba could recommend a longer wait, with a maximum delay of up to two years.",
        "The committee does not have the power to block an appointment.Labour has pledged to abide by any Acoba recommendation in relation to the hiring of Ms Gray.In his \u201cupdate into the circumstances leading to the resignation of a senior civil servant\u201d, Mr Dowden said: \u201cThe decision on any recommended restrictions on the appointment is for Acoba.\u201dEarlier, Sir Keir said he was \u201cconfident\u201d Ms Gray had not broken any rules.The Labour leader said he \u201chad no discussions with her while she was investigating Boris Johnson whatsoever, I don\u2019t think anyone is suggesting that\u2019s the case\u201d.He accused the Government of \u201ctrying to resurrect a story about Sue Gray\u201d because they \u201cdon\u2019t want to talk about the cost-of-living crisis\u201d before the local elections.Sir Keir is thought to want Ms Gray in place to help ready his party for power should he win the next general election, which is widely expected to be held next year.Senior Conservative allies of Mr Johnson have previously claimed that her jump from Whitehall to an Opposition political party called the Civil Service\u2019s neutrality into question."
