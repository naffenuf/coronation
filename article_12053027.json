        "Daily Mail Australia previously revealed the\u00a046-year-old had been\u00a0diagnosed with bowel cancer about May 2021, after an earlier bout with the disease.It is not suggested the cancer killed Zonfrillo, only that he had told friends its return was detected after a routine colonoscopy.\u00a0A close friend and former neighbour of Zonfrillo told Daily Mail Australia the chef sometimes opened up to him about his 'demons' over a glass of whisky.Stuart Ayer said he and his wife struck up a close relationship with the TV star's family during the three years they were next-door neighbours in Carlton.Speaking about Zonfrillo's relationship with his wife, Mr Ayer said 'they were a really solid couple'.'The kids were the light of his life,' he said. 'They're great kids and it's such a tragedy.'Daily Mail Australia has been told Zonfrillo had been receiving treatment for bowel cancer from at least June 2021, a month after it was detected in a colonoscopy.A source said at the time: 'No one in his circle is aware of what he is going through. Neither colleagues or friends.'\u00a0'He has not wanted anyone to know as he deals with this tough journey. He is coping poorly with chemo treatment, and the effects it is having.'\u00a0In the months that followed Zonfrillo was an out-patient at the Kinghorn Cancer Centre in Sydney and Epworth Oncology in Melbourne as well as seeking treatment in Queensland, the source said.",
        "Zonfrillo underwent chemotherapy while filming his second series of Celebrity MasterChef in 2021.Daily Mail Australia, which has seen evidence of Zonfrillo discussing the diagnosis\u00a0 with a close friend, contacted the chef and members of his family in August 2021 but received no response.\u00a0Another source said Zonfrillo had been avoiding hospital and was instead being attended by a doctor who was flown in to treat him.'He claimed that each time he was getting any medical treatment there was a barrage of nurses that keep coming into his room, and he didn't want to be impolite by asking to be left alone,' the source said.Zonfrillo was settling into Italian life when he had to return to Melbourne to undertake promotional work for the latest season of MasterChef from Monday morning.",
        "A source said Zonfrillo kept his health problems from most friends and colleagues, usually receiving treatment including chemotherapy when the hit cooking show was not filming.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is understood MasterChef co-host Andy Allen had a meeting with Channel Ten executives on Thursday morning, along with third MasterChef judge Melissa Leong, to discuss how publicity for the program would be handled.Zonfrillo, who recently moved to Rome with his family, left his wife and two young children Alfie and Isla in Italy to return for the launch of MasterChef's 15th season.",
        "Network Ten has announced the series, which had been due to begin on Monday, would now premiere on Sunday with the full support of Zonfrillo's grieving family.In his 2021 memoir Last Shot he did not mention suffering from cancer, but did discuss his years of heroin addiction as a young man in Glasgow.An autopsy will now be conducted to determine the celebrity chef\u2019s cause of death."
