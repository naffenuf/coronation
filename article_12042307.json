        "Alfie Steele died with 50 separate injuries across his head, back and buttocksJurors have been played a 999 call made by the mother of a nine-year-old boy found unresponsive in cold bath water - after he had allegedly been \u2018deliberately and repeatedly\u2019 beaten to death in his 'dishevelled house'.",
        "Carla Scott, 35, and fianc\u00e9 Dirk Howell, 41, are accused of murdering Alfie Steele \u2013 leaving the boy with 50 separate injuries across his head, back, legs and buttocks.Jurors have been Alfie told was pronounced dead after Scott dialled 999 claiming her son had 'fallen asleep' and drowned in the bath in February 2021.\u00a0During the early part of the call, Scott remained calm as she told the call operator she could \u2018feel a rattle\u2019 on her son\u2019s chest.She then added: \u2018He\u2019s not breathing, but he keeps making noises.\u2019",
        "When the operator asked \u2018What noises?\u2019 Scott replied: \u2018Lots of gargling noises.\u2019At one point during the audio call groaning noises could be heard in the background and Scott was asked if that was the patient.She then replied: \u2018I can see him breathing a bit, not a lot, but I can see him breathing a bit.\u2019",
        "PC Paul Pickering, an enhanced medically trained firearms officer who was in the first 999 crew to arrive at the scene, said he found a \u2018distressed\u2019 Scott upstairs, wearing a vest and knickers. \u2018She was knelt down over a child who was lying naked on the floor\u2019, he said.The court was then played the officer\u2019s heavily-redacted bodycam footage as he attempted chest compressions \u2013 the camera view bouncing up and down as he worked on the lifeless boy, at one point urging Alfie to \u2018come on mate\u2019.",
        "Another clip showed Scott clutching her phone on the landing, as the officer asked her when Alfie had been found collapsed.Scott replied: \u2018I can\u2019t remember\u2026about an hour ago\u2019. The officer replied: \u2018You\u2019re not making much sense here. When did you come across him (like this)?\u2019Scott then clarified: \u2018About ten minutes ago.\u2019 Soon after, she could be heard wailing \u2018Oh God.\u2019Describing the bedroom where Alfie was moved to after being found in the bath, a second police officer PC Stacey Hegenbarth said: \u2018I remember it being midday and very sunny, the curtains were drawn so it was very dark in there.\u2018There was a large, dirty, badly stained mattress on the floor. No bedding, no bed.\u2018The floor was dirty and sticky. I think there was a broken wardrobe in one corner. Just very untidy.\u2019",
        "But she said that downstairs, the property looked like \u2018a show home\u2019. She added: \u2018It was spotlessly clean.\u2018It was the polar opposite upstairs, it was a completely dishevelled property.\u2019The officer then broke down as she recalled having to step outside \u2018to take a moment\u2019 as attempts to resuscitate Aflie by paramedics continued.Scott was arrested on suspicion of child neglect at the scene in Droitwich, Worcestershire, jurors were told, after Alfie was taken to hospital.",
        "Prosecutor Michelle Heeley KC had earlier told Coventry Crown Court Alfie had endured a \u2018sad home life\u2019 in the months before his February 2021 death, suffering 'assaults and cruelty, by being beaten, assaulted, punished with cold water and made to endure a life that no child should lead.\u2019Jurors were told a social services care plan barred Howell \u2013 who had been in a relationship with Scott for 19 months and engaged to her for over a year \u2013 from staying overnight at the address.But Ms Heeley said the pair \u2018wilfully and continuously\u2019 flouted the rule, and that Howell had in fact been \u2018at the house since the previous night.\u2019He was spotted by attending police in a street close to the scene of Alfie\u2019s collapse and then tracked to the town\u2019s train station, where he Howell was arrested as he attempted to board a departing train.Ms Heeley said Howell favoured \u2018physical and psychological\u2019 forms of discipline. She added that both defendants \u2018thought it was acceptable\u2019 to hit Alfie with \u2018belts, or a slider - like a heavy-duty flip flop - and use other more sinister forms of punishment\u2019.Alfie was also forced to \u2018stand outside, in the middle of the night and have cold water\u2019 thrown over him and punished by dunkings in cold water, the court heard.",
        "Scott, of Droitwich, denies murder, manslaughter, causing or allowing the death of Alfie and child cruelty offences against her son and other children.Howell, of Birmingham, has previously admitted child cruelty offences against other children.\u00a0He denies murder, manslaughter, cruelty or causing or allowing the death of Alfie.The trial continues."
