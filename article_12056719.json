        "An emotional Steve Cotterill revealed his disbelief after 10-man Shrewsbury ended their League One campaign with a 1-0 defeat at Lincoln.",
        "Town dominated for over an hour but saw Luke Leahy and Rob Street hit the woodwork while Chey Dunkley and Jordan Shipley were denied by goalkeeper Carl Rushworth.On-loan City midfielder Matty Virtue rammed home the only goal after 73 minutes, with only their second shot on target.Max Sanders should have doubled the lead at the death but saw his penalty saved by Marko Marosi after Dunkley was sent off for upending Ben House in the box.Cotterill fought back tears as he admitted how disappointed he was to head away from Sincil Bank pointless.He said: \u201cI can\u2019t believe we have been beaten. I thought we were excellent. We were good value for the points, that\u2019s it in a nutshell.",
        "\u201cTheir keeper\u2019s made some great saves, we\u2019ve hit the bar twice and I just thought we were the better team by a mile.\u201cIt is gut-wrenching because they have put in so much hard work. We wanted to finish in the top 10 and if we had won, which we should have done, it would least have put us up into 11th.\u201cIt has, though, been real progression [this season] but it just doesn\u2019t feel like it at the moment. I\u2019m sad, I feel very sad.\u201cI am very proud of them. I am quite emotional \u2013 there has been so much adversity that we have had to fight through this season and we fought right up to the last minute.\u201d",
        "Lincoln\u2019s win secured them 11th spot in the table, a position that delighted boss Mark Kennedy, who has just completed his first full season with the Imps.He said: \u201cIt is beyond my wildest expectations. I\u2019m not saying my expectations were low, it\u2019s just that there were so many obstacles to overcome, so a huge thank you to the staff, the players, the board and the fans, who have been incredible. I just played a small part.\u201dKennedy pointed to the introduction of Sanders midway through the second half as the turning point in the match, saying: \u201cMax has been phenomenal this season.\u201cHe has been a standout performer which says a lot as he hasn\u2019t played a lot of football and he knows that. He completed changed the dynamics of the game.\u201dOn match winner Virtue, he added: \u201cI was quite frustrated with him early on as he was playing far too deep but he was much better in the second half and there was no surprise he got his goal.\u201cHe has had an outstanding season and he is someone we are keen to get hold of.\u201d"
