        "Wall Street\u2019s banking giants suffered a sell-off last night after the takeover of US regional lender First Republic failed to calm market nerves.",
        "The renewed turmoil intensified pressure on the Federal Reserve, the US\u2019s central bank, ahead of a decision tonight on whether to hike interest rates again even as the crisis among lenders deepens.Regional banks such as PacWest Bancorp and Metropolitan Bank , down 28 per cent and 20 per cent, suffered the biggest declines.",
        "But the jitters also spread to Wall Street heavyweights, including Bank of America, which slid 3 per cent, Wells Fargo, off by 3.8 per cent, and Citigroup, down 2.7 per cent.In London, Barclays fell 3.1 per cent, Standard Chartered dipped by 2.8\u00a0per cent and smaller UK lender Metro Bank lost 4.5\u00a0per cent in value.The FTSE 100 Index fell 1.2 per cent, or 97.54 points, to 7773.03 in a grim start to May trading, while New York\u2019s Dow Jones sunk 1.1 per cent.Fears that the US government could run out of money \u2013 due to a stand-off between the White House and Congress \u2013 as well as weaker-than-expected jobs data added to worries about the world\u2019s biggest economy.That sent the dollar lower and pushed oil prices down by 5 per cent, with Brent crude trading at around $75 a barrel.But it was the rescue of San Francisco-based lender First Republic by JP Morgan, in a deal brokered by US regulators, that created the biggest waves.",
        "Instead of calming the waters, it seemed to intensify investor focus on who could be next. \u2018Historically, once you see a resolution of one institution, the market tends to go after who they view as the next weakest link,\u2019 said Goldman Sachs regional banks analyst Ryan Nash.",
        "Jake Dollarhide, boss of Longbow Asset Management, said: \u2018If a confidence crisis can happen to First Republic, it can happen to any bank in this country.\u2019The broader crisis began in March with the collapse of American lenders Silicon Valley Bank, Signature and Silvergate. And it spread to Europe when Credit Suisse had to be rescued by UBS.Fresh fears about the sector emerged when First Republic last week disclosed it had suffered an exodus of \u00a380billion in customer deposits.\u00a0A rescue deal patched together over the weekend left JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon claiming: \u2018This part of the crisis is over.\u2019But the renewed turbulence suggested there was further trouble to come and put the spotlight on the Fed ahead of a rates decision tonight.\u00a0It is widely expected to raise borrowing rates by a further quarter percentage point in spite of the turbulence, as it battles inflation. But investors will be watching keenly for signs of where the Fed goes next.Thomas Hayes, chairman of Great Hill Capital, said yesterday\u2019s market turmoil showed that the central bank must signal a pause in rate hikes \u2018otherwise you\u2019re going to see continued turmoil in the banking system\u2019.",
