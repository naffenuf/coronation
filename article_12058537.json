        "'Your father doesn't pay my salary, the State of Virginia does,' said the teacher, according to the transcript, which was shared by NBC12.After the student says something 'inaudible', the teacher says: 'Well she can come up here all day and I'll speak English when I see her. And she's going to speak English too. Period. You act like your mom own the world, c'mon now.''I didn't say she owned the world,' replied the student.'I know but that is very ignorant of you to throw up your mom as if it's going to change the rules in my class. English is spoken in this class. Period,' said the teacher, according to the transcript.",
        "In an interview since the incident, the student, who wanted to remain anonymous, said she didn't want other Hispanic students to experience the same thing.'I just wanted that no other Hispanic kid would go through the same thing that I did,' she told NBC12.'I told one of my friends, oh, you don't have friends in Spanish because we joke around like that, and that teacher started yelling at me, telling me I couldn't speak Spanish,' the student said.'She just kept saying that it just wasn't allowed in here in America you speak English, and if I wanted to speak Spanish, then to go to wherever that Spanish-speaking country is,' she added.\u00a0",
        "The mother of the student said despite the suspension of the teacher she was worried they would be able to come back.'I just don't trust to send my student to a school where a teacher is treating my daughter that way,' the mother told NBC12.",
        "Richmond Public Schools provided a statement on the incident and confirmed the teacher was placed on leave.'Racism, bigotry, and intolerance of any kind will not be tolerated at Richmond Public Schools,' read the statement.'The employee is currently on administrative leave pending the outcome of an internal investigation by the Employee Relations team.'While we can not comment further on personnel matters, please know that RPS happily serves a diverse group of students across many races and nationalities.'We will continue to support and advocate for them all.'"
