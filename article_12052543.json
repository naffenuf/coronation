        "May 5 - Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Austan Goolsbee on Friday said it is 'way too premature' to suggest the stronger-than-expected job gains in April mean the central bank will need to raise interest rates when it meets again in June.",
        "\"We know that credit conditions like the ones we are seeing now in the past have been correlated with recessions, credit crunches,\" Goolsbee told Fox News. \"It's way too premature to know what to do with monetary policy.\" Goolsbee voted with all other Fed policymakers on Wednesday to raise the Fed's policy rate by a quarter point to 5.00%-5.25%.
