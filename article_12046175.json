It originated through Instagram.'Jutta was already in Miami a few weeks ago\u2026 she is now back in Miami for a Jake Paul show. Then she returns home without him.'Jutta has only recently got out of a relationship, and was with fellow speed-skater Koe Verweij until last summer.In December, she said: 'I'm having fun, although I'm not the type to stay single for the rest of my life.'It's fine for now but in the end I like to really build a relationship with someone. I still have a lot of love to give.'",
