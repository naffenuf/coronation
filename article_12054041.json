Funny old thing patriotism, grabs you in a weird way.'Others were quick to point out that a gospel choir had also performed at another royal occasion - at Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, wedding.The group at their 2018 nuptials famously performed a rendition of Ben E King's Stand By Me.\u00a0",

        "Another said: 'A Gospel choir at the Coronation for the first time. I think it's the influence of Harry &amp; Meghan's wedding. Almost forgot what I was watching.'\u00a0As well as the Gospel choir, another choir joined\u00a0by opera and concert singer Sir Bryn Terfel, performed the Kyrie - which was sung in Welsh for the first time.While King Charles took the oath the opera singer\u00a0sang an anthem by 17th century composer William Byrd.The choir then sang a different version of Alleluia, also by Wiseman, when\u00a0St Augustine's Gospel Book, dating back to the sixth century, was carried to the nave.This afternoon Charles became the 40th reigning sovereign to be crowned at Westminster Abbey, in a ceremony dating back to William the Conqueror in 1066, when Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby placed St Edward's Crown on his head.\u00a0The historic crowning, watched around the globe, was a fulfilment of the King's destiny, but followed the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, last September after a 70-year reign.\u00a0"
