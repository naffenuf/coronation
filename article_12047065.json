        "MILANO, May 4 (Reuters) - Credit Agricole has not submitted any request to Italian regulators to raise its stake in Banco BPM above 10%, the head of the Italian arm of the French bank Giampiero Maioli said on Thursday.",
        "Credit Agricole emerged as Banco BPM's single biggest investor a year ago, shortly after UniCredit held fire on a buyout offer it was ready to launch. The French bank has since raised its stake to 9.9%.Banco BPM, the third-largest bank in Italy, has long been seen as an attractive takeover target in the banking sector, where more consolidation is expected.
