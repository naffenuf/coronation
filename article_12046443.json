        "The 48-year-old was followed by her cat Bertie, aged eight, when she left the house to vote in North Leeds.\u00a0Ms Pretorius, who works in social media management, described her cat as a \u201cpolitical cativist\u201d and said he was \u201cinsistent\u201d on following her to vote.\u00a0Bertie celebrated exercising his democratic rights with \u201csome catnip and a snooze on the front lawn\u201d."
