        "After the first season was a ratings hit in 2021, the network has put Ally Landon back in the hosting seat alongside parenting expert Dr Justin Coulson.The new episodes look set to include some\u00a0confronting family dynamics, with\u00a0three young boys from a 'free range' outback family shown driving cars and shooting guns.The promo opens with a mother and father posing for novelty photos with their sons and dog, all of whom are dressed in jeans, flannels and cowboy hats.\u00a0'Being outback parents, we're all about respect and freedom. The kids get to learn so many life skills,' the father says in a voice over.",
        "Footage is then shown of the eldest son, a pre-teen, holding a rifle as his father watches on, telling him: 'Finger off the trigger until you're ready, mate.'Elsewhere, the boys are seen riding dirt bikes and quad bikes before the youngest two hop into a car and drive around the farm together.'Raising kids on a farm, they become independent,' their mother says.",
        "The trailer cuts to Ally asking the family, 'Is that legal?', to which the mother replies: 'On our property, yes.'The sneak peek ends with the middle child falling off a bucking calf and crying when he hurts himself, as his father laughs and says: 'You'll be right.'",
        "A release date for season two of Parental Guidance has yet to be announced.\u00a0"
