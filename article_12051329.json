And the son she had with ex-husband Dennis Quaid, 31-year-old Jack Quaid, is a busy actor - his latest gig is on a Star Trek animated series.\u00a0",

However, they got back together before the end of that year. Then they split again.",

She doesn't feel like\u2026there's no sweat on it, man,' she told the magazine.",

Life is good, it's so good with her in it. She and Jack get along great. All of us fit together beautifully.'Meg shared in that same interview that Daisy was randomly assigned to her, per China's adoption process.\u00a0But she feels it was fate.'I am convinced, completely convinced that there was nothing random about it. She is the daughter I should have,' she said.'I never felt like I was on a rescue mission or anything like that. I just really wanted a baby; I was on a mission to connect with somebody, and Daisy and I got to meet each other this way at this time,' said the star.",

And also having the experience of having had Jack and now to have Daisy in a different way\u2014there's no difference in the love you feel.The When Harry Met Sally\u2026 star also talked being a single mother.'I mean, Jack has his dad and they're close, he'll always have that. But when you're the only one in the house with the kids, you get to be the one in charge. You're the one making the rules. There's no stress because you and some other adult don't agree on how you want to raise your kids,' she said.",
