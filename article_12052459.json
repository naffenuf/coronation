Her husband, Wes Lomnicki, is Empire\u00b4s sporting director.\"Yesterday the Board of the Chicago Red Stars ended Michelle Lomnicki\u00b4s employment effective immediately after learning about a lapse in judgment to not share important information with club leadership. The Board determined that it is in the best interest of the players, staff and organization to part ways at this time,\" the team's board said in a statement Friday.Lomnicki and Harrington did not respond to requests for comment by The Associated Press. The team's statement did not specify the reasons for her dismissal.Lomnicki told The Athletic in a statement that she had no role in hiring decisions for the Empire.In January, Harrington was among six people disciplined by the NWSL in the wake of a pair of investigations into misconduct across the league.",

Harrington and former Gotham general manager Alyse LaHue were suspended from working in the NWSL for two years, until Jan. 9, 2025.Harrington was coach of the Royals in 2020 before he was placed on leave for alleged verbal abuse.
