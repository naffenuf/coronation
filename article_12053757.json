        "The pair, who are currently on-screen presenting I\u2019m A Celebrity\u2026 South Africa, entered the abbey just before 9am in their morning suits, greeting other guests with waves and smiles.As the pair grinned and said hello to members of the congregation in the North Transept, they were welcomed with impromptu cheers.",
        "Best known for fronting shows including Saturday Night Takeaway, I\u2019m A Celebrity\u2026 Get Me Out Of Here! and Britain\u2019s Got Talent, Ant and Dec have hosted the Prince\u2019s Trust Awards 10 times and recently collaborated with the charity on a course to make the media industry more accessible.",
        "Oscar-winning actress Dame Emma, wearing a red floral jacket and her damehood medal and insignia, was accompanied by her husband, actor Greg Wise, for the ceremony.Australian singer Cave was in conversation with former Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams as they arrived at the abbey.As part of the BBC\u2019s centenary celebrations last year, Charles visited Blades for a special episode of The Repair Shop where his bracket clock and a piece made for Queen Victoria\u2019s diamond jubilee by British ceramics maker Wemyss Ware were fixed.Spice Girl Melanie Brown also spoke to ITV outside the abbey, recounting the girl group\u2019s famous encounter with Charles in 1997.She said: \u201cI think because we were all so excited on the day we all just kind of freaked out a bit, and broke protocol, and I gave him a kiss and then Geri gave him a kiss and pinched his bum\u2026 we were just overwhelmed with excitedness. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d do that again though\u2026 we were all just too excited.\u201d",
        "Fry told BBC News he was grateful to have been invited to the \u201cthousand-year-old ceremony, so rooted in the history of our islands\u201d.Singer-songwriter Joan Armatrading, who received a CBE for services to music, charity and equal rights in the late Queen\u2019s 2020 birthday honours, and magician Dynamo, real name Steven Frayne, were also pictured seated in the Abbey.Other notable faces expected to be in the audience include David and Victoria Beckham, Stella McCartney, Rowan Atkinson and Bear Grylls.Heads of state and kings and queens from across the globe, everyday heroes and family and friends of the royal couple are also on the guest list."
