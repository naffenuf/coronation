Analysts polled by Reuters expected a profit of 643 million euros.",
        "Earnings at the country's biggest lender by domestic assets were also supported by a solid performance at its insurance services business, which rose 24%.Loan-loss provisions rose 12% year-on-year and the cost of risk, which measures the cost of managing potential losses, ticked up to 26 basis points from 25 bps in December.For 2023, it lowered its cost of risk's guidance to less than 30 bps from previously less than 40 bps.By the end of March, deposits from retail clients at Caixabank fell 1.4% against December.Deposit levels at banks have come into sharper focus after the collapse of U.S. lender Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in March sparked jitters across the global banking sector.At the end of March, Caixabank ended with a liquidity coverage ratio of 192%, compared to 194% at the end of December.($1 = 0.9056 euros) (Reporting by Jes\u00fas Aguado; additional reporting by Emma Pinedo; Editing by Inti Landauro, Varun H K and Jane Merriman)"
