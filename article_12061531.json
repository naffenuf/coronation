He was that way as a leader, mentor, and friend at our organization too. He was loved and respected by his and our entire team,\" the post said.",
        "Andria Gaither, assistant manager at the mall's Tommy Hilfiger store, said she was devastated to learn that one of the dead was Christian LaCour, a 20-year-old security guard who previously worked at the clothing store and often stopped in to chat. Gaither herself had run for her life when shots rang out.",
        "Just a few nights earlier, she had called LaCour when a customer wanted to come inside after hours. He came and asked the man to leave, then offered a security escort to her and two teenage employees.\"He wanted us to feel safe,\" Gaither said.\"I\u00b4m just in shock,\" she added. \"He was very young, very sweet, came in all the time to visit with us.\"Also killed was Aishwarya Thatikonda, 26, who was from India, held a graduate degree in construction management and worked as a civil engineer at the Dallas-area firm Perfect General Contractors.She was \"always prepared to give her very best,\" company founder Srinivas Chaluvadi said in an email.He said her parents live in Hyderabad, India, where her father is a judge.\"She came to the United States with a dream to make a career, build a family, own a home and live forever in Dallas,\" Chaluvadi said.Chaluvadi said Thatikonda would have turned 27 next week and that she had become like family: \"She attended birthday parties at my home, we celebrated festivals together and we had family dinners.\"",
        "An aunt of the Mendoza sisters said their mother was still hospitalized and asked for prayers.\"Please pray for our now broken family. The girls have left a void that nothing in the world could ever fill. Please pray for their mom, my sister, and her broken heart,\" wrote Anabel Del Angel in a fundraising post verified by GoFundMe. She also asked for prayers for the girls' father.Jena Blue, who lives down the street from the Mendoza family, has been to their garage sales and seen Ilda Mendoza walk her two daughters to school.\"She just seemed like a mom just like me,\" Blue said.For Halloween, she said the Mendozas would have a screen playing movies while another neighbor would serve snacks and drinks.\"Whenever you would round the corner right by their house, you\u00b4d get like a hot dog, a treat and chips. And watch a movie,\" Blue said.Elio Cumana-Rivas, 32, was also killed, authorities said. His brother, Gregory Smith Cumana, said that Cumana-Rivas, who was from Venezuela, had moved to the U.S. \"in search of the American dream,\" ABC News reported.Authorities are investigating Garcia's motive for the attack, which ended when the suspected gunman - 33-year-old Mauricio Garcia - was fatally shot by police.An Associated Press review of his online activity shows he had a fascination with white supremacy and mass shootings, and large Nazi tattoos.",

Associated Press writers Michael Balsamo in Washington, Terry Tang in Phoenix and Audrey McAvoy in Honolulu contributed.___The contribution line has been corrected to reflect that Alvarez reported from New York, not Los Angeles."
