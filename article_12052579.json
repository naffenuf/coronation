        "Follow MailOnline's new Royals channel for all the latest news and updates\u00a0On the morning of Tuesday, June 2, 1953, Britain awoke to grey skies and pouring rain. For once, though, nobody cared about the weather. For this was the day to which millions of people had looked forward for months \u2014 the Coronation of Elizabeth II.",
        "In a country still haunted by the sacrifices of World War II, with many cities scarred by bomb damage and the economy hidebound by austerity, the late Queen\u2019s Coronation brought a welcome splash of colour and excitement.To the spectators packed into the streets of London, the pomp and pageantry made for an unrivalled spectacle. The guests included some of the most celebrated statesmen on the planet, from the indomitable lion Sir Winston Churchill to Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of a recently independent India.And the event itself was a heady blend of ancient and modern, the reassurance of tradition and the shock of the new.On the one hand, the gleaming Gold State Coach, an emblem of Britain\u2019s monarchical heritage; on the other, the roar of fighter planes hurtling overhead.",
        "Such was the mood in early 1950s Britain \u2014 a country, in many ways, astonishingly different from our own. Yet at the heart of the spectacle, then as now, was a single individual, the focus of so many ordinary people\u2019s respect and affection.While our King, at 74, is the oldest British monarch ever to be crowned, his late mother was just 27 for her own coronation in Westminster Abbey.Thanks to her youth, Elizabeth was already the object of unrivalled worldwide fascination. As Churchill, her first Prime Minister, put it, \u2018all the film people in the world, if they had scoured the globe, could not have found anyone so suited to the part\u2019.",
        "For Elizabeth, the Coronation was above all a solemn spiritual occasion. When the Archbishop of Canterbury, Geoffrey Fisher, anointed her with oil and placed the crown on her head, this was the moment she dedicated herself, body and soul, to the service of her people.The fact that Archbishop Fisher was a Victorian, born in 1887, is a startling reminder of our late Queen\u2019s extraordinary longevity.",
        "And in many respects the vast crowds who lined the streets of London, more than a million people defying the driving rain, look like figures from a vanished age. Study their pale faces in the newsreel footage, and you\u2019re immediately struck by how small and thin they seem, compared with their counterparts today.Their clothes are heavy and grey, to keep them warm in an age before central heating. And it\u2019s notable how alike they look, products of an age of collective consensus, rather than individual self-expression.This was a country of smog and fog; of thick greatcoats, stodgy food and heavy coins. It was the Britain of Stanley Matthews and Billy Wright, Aneurin Bevan and Anthony Eden, Vera Lynn and Arthur Askey.Capital punishment still had strong support. Only a few months earlier, in January 1953, the 19-year-old burglar Derek Bentley had been hanged for the murder of a policeman, despite the fact it had been his 16-year-old friend who fired the fatal shot.",
        "More than one in four people had outside toilets. Fridges and washing machines were expensive luxuries, and there were just 3 million cars on the roads, compared with more than 35 million today.Politically, Britain in 1953 was extraordinarily backward-looking. The Prime Minister, Churchill, had first entered the Cabinet in 1908, almost half a century earlier. He had suffered several minor strokes, and even his closest friends admitted that he was coasting on past glories.Much of Churchill\u2019s energy was devoted to the tasks of preserving peace in the era of the Cold War, and holding together the colonies of the crumbling British Empire.Yet by the time of the Coronation, his Foreign Secretary, Anthony Eden, was already negotiating the withdrawal of British troops from the Suez Canal (beginning the ignominious saga that would later blow up Eden\u2019s premiership).The Empire loomed large in the national consciousness that damp day in 1953, thanks not least to the troops from Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Pakistan, South Africa and Ceylon (today Sri Lanka) who joined the procession. In her Coronation Day speech, the Queen pledged to uphold \u2018the living strength and majesty of the Commonwealth and Empire; of societies old and new; of lands and races different in history and origins but all, by God\u2019s Will, united in spirit and in aim\u2019.",
        "And even the recipe created especially for the palace banquet \u2014 curried coronation chicken, invented by the food writer Constance Spry and the chef Rosemary Hume \u2014 was a reminder of the glories of the Empire in India.For those who wondered whether, in reality, the Empire\u2019s days were numbered, fate offered a dramatic rebuke. On the very morning of the Coronation, the news broke that Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay had done the impossible and conquered Mount Everest in the name of Commonwealth and Empire.",
        "To the newspapers it seemed a blessing from heaven, a sign that God was smiling on the country once again. \u2018Be Proud of Britain on this Day,\u2019 roared one headline, exulting at a \u2018stroke in the true Elizabethan vein, a reminder that the old adventurous, defiant heart of the race remains unchanged\u2019. Yet for all the idealistic talk of a New Elizabethan Age, Britain in 1953 was a tired, grey, even threadbare country, exhausted after more than a decade of austerity.London, the backdrop for the new Queen\u2019s big day, struck one visitor a year earlier as \u2018scarred and dingy\u2019, a vision of \u2018rubble, greyness, smog, poverty, garish whores on the streets in Soho, trams still running along Kingsway, tramps sleeping on the Embankment and under the Arches\u2019.",
        "The writer Cyril Connolly called it \u2018the largest, saddest and dirtiest of great cities, with its miles of unpainted, half-inhabited houses, its chopless chop-houses, its beerless pubs . . . under a sky permanently dull and lowering like a metal dish-cover\u2019. That might sound harsh. Yet only a few months earlier, in December 1952, the five-day \u2018Great Smog\u2019 had killed an estimated 10,000 people, who died of respiratory diseases thanks to the unusually cold weather, windless conditions and thick fog of coalsmoke that hung over London.The capital in 1953 wasn\u2019t just colder and damper than today\u2019s London, it was sootier, smokier and smellier. It\u2019s easy to forget, for example, that the majority of men puffed on cigarettes, cigars and pipes, including, amazingly, almost nine out of ten doctors.More than one in ten houses had no electricity, and most were heated by a coal fire in a single room. In the back streets of industrial towns and cities \u2014 as London still was in those days \u2014 smoke poured from the fireplaces of hundreds of terraced houses to mingle with the black clouds belching from factory chimneys.",
        "Coughs and colds were common; dirt clung to people\u2019s clothes. As late as 1950, one survey found that nearly half of all homes had no bathroom, with people filling tin baths by kettle instead.",
        "In other ways, too, the Britain of 1953 seems utterly different from our own. The population was smaller, at just 51 million, and much younger, with almost 22 million people under the age of 30. People married and had children earlier.And with mass immigration only just dawning, black and brown faces were relatively uncommon. Look at any newsreel footage of the Coronation crowds, and the people are almost entirely white.In some ways, therefore, Britain in 1953 was much more conservative, settled and tight-knit than it is today. In its special Coronation supplement, the Observer newspaper even declared that \u2018the country is today a more united and stabler society than it has been since the Industrial Revolution\u2019.Yet there were darker sides \u2014 not just the signs in landladies\u2019 windows (\u2018No blacks, no Irish\u2019), but the relentless persecution of people who were different. A good example is the Metropolitan Police\u2019s crackdown on homosexual activity, which was inspired by the demand to \u2018clean up the streets\u2019 in time for the Coronation.Only months earlier, the Sunday Pictorial (today the Sunday Mirror) had run a three-part series under the banner headline \u2018Evil Men\u2019, promising \u2018an end to the conspiracy of silence\u2019 about homosexuality in Britain. According to the paper, this \u2018spreading fungus\u2019 had infected \u2018generals, admirals, fighter pilots, engine drivers and boxers\u2019, and it demanded a ferocious prosecution drive before the Queen\u2019s big day.",
        "In this respect, I imagine few of us would want to see the clock turned back. At its best, 1950s Britain could be supportive and united. But at its worst, it was stifling and repressive.While it\u2019s tempting to see Britain back then as a lost world of timeless conservatism, untouched by the seismic social and cultural transformations of the Swinging Sixties, change was already under way.Indeed, the Coronation itself wasn\u2019t just a link with the hallowed past. As the first significant televised occasion in British history, it was a glimpse into the small-screen future.Though television was in its infancy, sales of new black-and-white TVs doubled in the month before the big day.And although only about 3 million people owned a set, it\u2019s estimated that about 25 million, more than half of the adult population, squeezed into their neighbours\u2019 sitting rooms to watch hours of the BBC\u2019s reverential coverage.Thanks to the Mass Observation project, in which volunteers recorded their impressions of daily life, we know what people made of what a teenage diarist excitedly called \u2018the Great Day\u2019.",
        "On one farm where half a dozen women gathered to watch the coverage, the general feeling was anxiety for the young Queen.\u2018It\u2019s a tiring day for her. Two-and- a-half hours in the Abbey. It\u2019s the whole day really,\u2019 one woman said worriedly.\u2018I expect she packs herself up a couple of sandwiches,\u2019 another said. But a third was concerned that it was all going to be a bit dull. \u2018I wish some of the ladies-in-waiting would trip over,\u2019 she said wistfully. \u2018Give us a bit of fun.\u2019When the Coronation was over, though, everybody agreed it had been marvellous. \u2018Once it started, we couldn\u2019t tear ourselves away from the set,\u2019 one woman wrote.\u2018If anyone had said beforehand we would sit spellbound for so long, I would have thought it was impossible,\u2019 another viewer reported. But \u2018it was an experience that I will not forget as long as I live\u2019.Were these viewers in 1953 so different, then, from the millions who will tune in to watch the King\u2019s Coronation? Perhaps not.After all, many of their anxieties \u2014 technological change, international unrest, the morals of the young, even the rising prices in the shops and the threat of nuclear attack by the Kremlin \u2014 sound remarkably familiar today.Their clothes, their habits, even their accents might strike many people as old-fashioned. But in their affection for the monarchy and their uncomplicated love of country, those viewers in 1953 surely weren\u2019t so different from the tens of millions of us who will raise a glass to the King today.What, wondered George Orwell a few years before the Coronation, does one generation\u2019s Britain have in common with another\u2019s? On the face of it, nothing.\u2018But then,\u2019 he went on, \u2018what have you in common with the child of five whose photograph your mother keeps on the mantelpiece? Nothing, except that you happen to be the same person.\u2019Pure sentimentalism? Perhaps.But when the crowds pour into the streets today to cheer our newly crowned King, they\u2019ll be following in the footsteps of countless Britons in years gone by, who shared many of the same hopes, dreams and fears familiar to us all.Celebrities, politicians, even individual kings and queens come and go. But the spirit of the nation remains, and the soul of Britain endures. And so amid the Coronation celebrations, let\u2019s raise a glass to those who came before us \u2014 the men and women who built the foundations on which we stand."
