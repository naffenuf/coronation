        "Chef Bae took viewers with her to Erewhon, the grocery store known for its celebrity customers and high-end organic items.\u00a0Erewhon is known to be one of the most luxurious grocery stores in all of California that contains\u00a0high-priced, locally produced and organic items.\u00a0The most elite celebrities shop at the grocery store including Kourtney Kardashian, Hailey Bieber, Miley Cyrus, and Kaia Gerber.\u00a0Chef Bae has posted several videos that see her shopping at the upscale grocery store, showing herself opting for $33 nuts, and a cart full of what many would call 'basic' items.\u00a0",
        "She filled her shopping cart to the brim, grabbing two $30 water bottles, $7 figs, 'the entire line of' $53 mushroom powder, and $35 balsamic vinegar, along with other luxury goods.\u00a0Filming herself checking out, she left viewers jaw-dropped when she revealed her total came out to $944.\u00a0In addition to her costly Erewhon haul, the chef also boasted about $200 honey she overnight shipped from New Zealand and $200 caviar from the brand Caviar Mermaid, who is known for its 'fresh river' caviar.\u00a0'I then get started on my pizza dough with beauty powder, collagen powder, Erewhon flours, Erewhon olive oil, Erewhon $30 water, and I give it a mix and give it a need and let it sit for about 30 minutes,' she said as she prepared her pizza dough.\u00a0",
        "After creating the dough, she topped it with superfood pesto, almond milk ricotta, and some tomatoes.\u00a0After baking the pie, she adds even more gold-filled pesto.\u00a0\u00a0She said the total cost of her pie came out to $1,394.48, however, she didn't include the price of the 24K gold flakes she topped her pizza with, which can range anywhere from $20 to $300.\u00a0And while she said her celebrity client - whom she did not reveal the name of - 'drooled' over the pizza that was topped with green pesto and gold flakes, her followers couldn't help but notice how the pie was 'more than [their] rent.'\u00a0",
        "One person said: 'No shade to your job, but all I can think of is how many homeless people could be fed for the cost of a pizza!''I\u2019m a teacher and I eat ramen noodles because I can\u2019t afford groceries until payday. But slay,' another person added.\u00a0Someone else wrote: 'This makes me think about how many kids go hungry at night in our country and there are others living like this.'\u00a0'It\u2019s wild to me to think about how some people can\u2019t afford water and food but then some can afford $2k pizza,' commented another person.\u00a0Another user added: 'I appreciate your job and all but why do people spend so much on groceries, filtered tap water would make that dough just as good.'\u00a0",
        "'Never in my life would I say I want a $2,000 pizza appetizer\u2026.no matter how much money I have. This is wild to me lol,' commented one user.\u00a0Someone else wrote: 'Crazy that some people don\u2019t have money to live, and others are paying people to put gold flakes on their pizza.'\u00a0Another person commented: 'This is so sad. So many people are starving but hey, let\u2019s make a $2k pizza with gold flakes. $2k could\u2019ve fed a homeless shelter.''This is so unnecessary and says a lot about the celeb. I also work for celebs as a chef, and they are definitely not extra like this,' one user added.",
        "'This is so tone deaf lol,' said someone else.\u00a0Although inflation has decreased in the past few months, it still remains high and sits at 7.1 per cent.According to consumer data firm Dunnhumby, one-third of households are skipping meals or reducing their portion sizes to save money.\u00a0",
