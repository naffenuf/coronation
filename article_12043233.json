        "Ireland\u2019s premier has urged respect for those who support the monarchy in the UK after two opposition parliamentarians questioned the time Irish national broadcaster RTE is devoting to the King\u2019s coronation.",
        "Leo Varadkar stressed that the model of constitutional monarchy is backed by a majority of people in the United Kingdom as he responded to criticism levelled by two socialist TDs in the Dail parliament in Dublin.Paul Murphy and Richard Boyd Barrett from People Before Profit-Solidarity both raised concerns that RTE One is devoting four hours of televised coverage of Saturday\u2019s events in London.Mr Murphy branded the monarchy an institution built on \u201cracism, privilege and empire\u201d and claimed the coronation was a \u201cvery obvious attempt to rehabilitate that institution\u201d.\u201cSome republicans are saying that they are going to attend this coronation on the grounds of reaching out to the unionist community,\u201d he said.",
        "\u201cWe think it is perfectly possible and necessary to build a united socialist movement of working-class people from a Catholic background, Protestant background, and a non-religious background, not on the basis of this sort of anachronistic and hated institution, but on the basis of the interests of ordinary people and the need for a socialist Ireland in a socialist world.\u201cEven in Britain only 29% of people think that the monarchy is very important, it\u2019s an increasingly unpopular institution.\u201cBut, yet, if you turn on RTE on Saturday, you\u2019re going to be treated to four hours of the coronation.",
        "\u201cWhy on earth is our state broadcaster spending four hours on a Saturday displaying this so-called coronation?\u201dMr Boyd Barrett stressed that Ireland was a republic.\u201cWhatever political differences there are, I think most of us identify with the aspect of it being republic, that we don\u2019t believe in kings and monarchs and inherited power and privilege, particularly when it\u2019s associated with empire, with colonialism, with shocking inequalities between a tiny group who have that inherited power among the royal aristocracy and ordinary people,\u201d he said.\u201cAnd against that background, while of course we all very, very much welcome the peace that arose from, or accompanied at least, the Good Friday Agreement, the idea that sort of building bridges should extend to us having an uncritical approach to a coronation, something by the way that most of the remaining royal houses in Europe have completely abandoned, they don\u2019t have coronations anymore, it\u2019s not legally required.",
        "\u201cYet this weekend, we are going to have huge amounts of public money in Britain spent on this coronation, an insult to huge numbers of people living in poverty in Britain.\u201cAnd\u2026the national broadcaster in this country is going to broadcast this for four hours.\u201cI mean, is that really an appropriate thing to be done from the standpoint of a republic?\u201d",
        "Responding during a question and answer session in the Dail, Mr Varadkar said: \u201cThe United Kingdom is a constitutional monarchy.\u201cThat position is supported by the majority of its people.\u201cI think that\u2019s something we should respect.\u201cMonarchies sometimes become republics.\u201cBarbados was the latest to do that.\u201cBut they do when their people want to change their system of government and the majority of people in United Kingdom want a constitutional monarchy with a democratically elected parliament and government and I think we should respect their choices.\u201d"
