        "Neser, 33, trapped Dawid Malan in front before then bowling\u00a0Yorkshire all-rounders George Hill and\u00a0Dom Bess.He finished with the impressive figures of 7-32 from 11 overs.The Queensland veteran also became the 11th Glamorgan cricketer to claim a hat-trick - and remains hopeful he may yet feature in the series against England.'It's disappointing not to be part of that squad, but I've got to look at the positives,' Neser told reporters.",
        "'I'm playing cricket here [in the UK], and if I do get called up, I'll be ready to go.'Having matches under my belt is far more important than bowling overs in the nets and not playing any games.\u00a0'It would be a special moment if I was selected for the Ashes squad in the back half of the tour.'Neser - who also took a hat-trick in December for the Brisbane Heat in the Big Bash - was overlooked for Scott Boland.Skipper Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc were selection certainties.In Sussex, star Australian batsman Steve Smith looked in good touch until he was given out LBW for 30.The first Test begins on June 16 at Edgbaston."
