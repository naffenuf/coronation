        "'It's now up to the players, me and the coaching staff to be together, get the willingness in and the belief that we can take it and this team has it.'You can't feel sorry for yourself, as a team stick together, as an individual take responsibility, make sure you have the energy, you have the focus, then play as a team and you get a result because we have proof of that all season.One player that might benefit from some downtime more than others is United's number one De Gea. The goalkeeper has come under fire for recent costly errors and there are reported concerns over his place in Ten Hag's starting squad.The Spaniard is currently negotiating a new deal with the club but sections of supporters want him replaced in the summer after growing tired over uninspiring performances.\u00a0"
