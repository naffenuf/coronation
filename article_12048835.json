Officials did not immediately release any details on how he was captured. The investigation into Marin-Sotelo's exact movements since his escape is ongoing, according to the agency.Marin-Sotelo escaped from the jail at about 1 a.m. on Sunday and left in a red or burgundy Ford Mustang, FBI officials said. The other escapee, Bruce Callahan, who was being held on drug charges, left the prison later that day, jail officials said. The jail superintendent said guards didn't notice the inmates were missing until about 26 hours after Marin-Sotelo escaped. Authorities have not said whether the two escapes are related.
