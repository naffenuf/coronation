        "Ariana Madix reflected on her volatile recent months as she accepted an MTV Movie &amp; TV Award on Sunday.",
        "The 37-year-old reality television star - who was recently spotted out with her new beau - won the honor of Best On-Screen Team along with Vanderpump Rules costars Katie Maloney, 36,\u00a0Scheana Shay, 38, and Lala Kent, 32.Madix called the recent time in her and the Bravo TV cast's lives 'tumultuous' as she gave an acceptance speech remotely.'Thank you, thank you, thank you. We have been through so many ups and downs. A tumultuous time in all of our lives,' she remarked.The blonde beauty was of course referring to the sudden demise of her nine-year relationship with ex-boyfriend Tom Sandoval, who had an affair with costar Raquel Leviss.",

        "The star added, 'We are truly at our best when we come together as a team. So thank you! We did it.'",
        "The trio of women donned the same black hooded sweatshirt that read in white letters: 'Everynite is VPR Nite.'Katie, who last year divorced husband Tom Schwartz, wore her dark bob haircut in a side part with a slight flip at the ends.She contributed, gratefully, 'Wow. Best on-screen team. Thank you so much, MTV, and especially to everyone that voted for us.\u00a0Scheana added, 'The team isn't just us. I mean, we have an entire production team behind us that makes the show possible.''This is so exciting. We won best team all because of you guys, the fans. Thank you so much for voting.'The mother-of-one's shoulder-length, ombre brunette and blonde hair was parted down the center and styled straight.\u00a0And Kent added in a separate video, 'Hello, my loves. Thank you all for voting for me and my most favorite girls, Scheana, Katie, and Ariana. We are beyond grateful. This is crazy. Again, thank you guys so much.'",
        "The women beamed as Ariana, whose bright locks were pulled into a casual, low bun, held the red popcorn statue.Lala joined in virtually from a different location than her three costars, donning a white sweatshirt that said, 'Send it to Daniel,' a reference to a spat with Leviss.\u00a0She was in good spirits in the pre-recorded clip, appearing with her frosty blonde locks flowing over her chest in an off-center part.\u00a0",
        "Sandoval's infidelity began in August 2022 and lasted for seven months until Ariana discovered intimate FaceTime videos on Tom's phone between him and Raquel.Raquel has since checked herself into a mental health facility.The Missouri native later admitted his relationship with Ariana was 'just lacking intimacy' and 'connection.'\u00a0He felt that they were remaining together to 'keep the optics up that [they] were solid' for their reality show and other business endeavors.\u00a0",
        "The 2023 MTV Movie &amp; TV Awards aired Sunday from the Barker Hangar in Santa Monica, California in a pre-taped broadcast amid the start of the WGA writers' strike earlier this week.Films including Avatar: The Way Of Water, Elvis, Nope and Top Gun: Maverick are among those competing for the Best Movie award, while The Last Of Us, Stranger Things, Wednesday, The White Lotus, Yellowstone and Yellowjackets are among the nominees in the Best Show category.The long-running awards show is one of the first victims of the ongoing dispute between the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers and the Writers Guild of America union.Officials from the Writers Guild had pledged to picket at the event in Southern California - which would have put celebrities in the awkward position of crossing the line - until MTV scuttled the live event Saturday evening.",
