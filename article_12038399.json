        "The job for a flood risk engineer saw a 167 percent increase, which the company attributes to\u00a0increased infrastructure spending from the government boosting job openings.Both the global and US report had customer service associate rank as third amid a time when AI is poised to take over this occupation.\u00a0'Demand for customer-facing roles is growing, as many companies are shifting away from product innovation and focusing on customer satisfaction to grow their businesses in the face of a volatile global economy,' shared Lensa.OpenAI's ChatGPT launched after the report's data was compiled, suggesting people might not search for customer service associates as a job position in 2023.The company and researchers at the University of Pennsylvania released a study in March that warns AI systems\u00a0will impact 80 percent of US jobs, with personal financial advisors and brokers, insurers and data processors at the top of the list.The team found that about 15 percent of all worker tasks could be completed significantly faster by AI and with the same level of quality.\u00a0",
        "The most 'exposure' falls on white color jobs, such as mathematicians, accountants and writers, and occupations making at least $80,000 a year.\u00a0The study analyzed 1,016 occupations and their 19,265 tasks and obtained employment and wage data from the 2020 and 2021 Occupational Employment series provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.The team then cross-analyzed the data with AI capabilities to see which positions could run smoother when done by the technology.The overall findings show 'at least 10 percent of their work tasks affected by the introduction of LLMs, while approximately 19 percent of workers may see at least 50 percent of their tasks impacted,' reads the study published in arXiv.The team looked at exposure when formulating the list of jobs at risk, which included basic skills of occupations like active listening, speaking and critical thinking that Ai is designed to perform.The study determined 86 occupations as 'fully exposed' to AI, with several receiving 100 percent scores.These include legal secretaries, clinical data managers, web designers and journalists."
