        "Frankie Bridge has taken to Instagram to share that she has been 'genuinely impressed' with the results of a heatless curls kit.\u00a0The heatless curls kit, which allows you to get curls without any heat damage, has been going viral on social media. And we've found a \u00a39.96 heatless curling set\u00a0that's almost identical to the \u00a342 Silkenberry kit Frankie used.\u00a0  Heatless Hair Curling Set\u00a0 Many of us are used to dosing our hair in heat protectant and then taking a smoking hot iron to give our hair body.\u00a0But it doesn't have to be this way. Frankie Bridge has recently taken to Instagram to share how impressed she has been with a totally heatless hair tool.\u00a0You can buy a version very similar to the one she used for just \u00a39.96 on Amazon.\u00a0Simply wrap your hair around the curlers and leave them in overnight for beautiful, bouncy curls in the morning.\u00a0 \u00a39.96\u00a0 Shop",
        "Frankie has always been a hair icon. Back at the height of The Saturdays fame, she had us all seriously considering asking for a pixie cut at our next hairdresser's appointment. These days she still stuns, but with a shoulder-length bob, which does look fab when wavy.\u00a0Frankie wrote in her Instagram post that she was 'sceptical it was going to work on shorter hair like mine, but it creates a really nice, natural wave'. So, it's great to hear that those of us with shorter hair can rock the Frankie-approved look.\u00a0",
        "She also wrote in her post: 'takes less than 5 minutes to put in place, you can sleep in it, and there\u2019s no heat damage!'\u00a0Yep, gone are the days when we need to drench our hair in heat protectant and give our arms an hour-long workout while we craft the perfect curls with a hot iron. Instead, we can wack this in our hair and hit the hay to look great.\u00a0",
        "The curling set comes with silky scrunchies and foam rod, because it's of a silky material, breakage will be minimized (you can sleep with peace of mind!). There's even a handy clip to make sure it all stays in place if you toss and turn at night time.\u00a0It's not only Frankie that is raving about this damage-free way of giving curl and body to hair. This curling set has received hundreds of five-star reviews on Amazon, some people have said it has given their hair a 'bouncy blow dry look', while others noted how easy it is to use.\u00a0'Changed my hair routine,' wrote one happy customer. 'I honestly wouldn\u2019t go without this now. Found it really easy to use and if you spray your hair with a little water the curls last all day, looks like I\u2019ve had a bouncy blow dry.'\u00a0",
        "'Easy to use,' a second wrote. 'This product is amazing, always struggled to curl my hair and it never looked nice. If you want results with minimum effort and maximum results then these are perfect.'A third penned: 'I was a bit sceptical of this because of the low price tag, but it\u2019s brilliant!! I wrapped 80 per cent dried hair around the band, as per instructions and left it for 2-3 hours - the results were amazing!'.So, if you would like to take a leaf out of Frankie's book and get bouncy waves without long-term damage, shop\u00a0 the Heatless Hair Curling Set for\u00a0\u00a39.96.\u00a0"
