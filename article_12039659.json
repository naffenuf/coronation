        "Mikel Arteta watched his Arsenal team return to the top of the Premier League table with victory over Chelsea before insisting he would not let his players\u2019 heads drop.",
        "The Gunners were eight points clear last month but had fallen behind Manchester City following a run of four winless game \u2013 a streak that ended with a comfortable 3-1 win over the beleaguered Blues.Captain Martin Odegaard scored twice before Gabriel Jesus wrapped up the win before half-time as Noni Madueke\u2019s first league goal proved a mere consolation for Frank Lampard\u2019s visitors.Despite their recent run, Arteta had refused to rule Arsenal out of the title race and this win took them two points clear \u2013 although they have played two more games than City.The Spaniard admitted he did not want to see morale fall after a galling loss at City last week saw their lead all but dashed.\u201cIt is four games to go, we are at the top right now,\u201d he said. We have to enjoy it and embrace it, maximise the opportunity that we have because we don't know what is going to happen  Mikel Arteta  \u201cWe cannot do that (let heads drop), to be where we are after 10 months against the team we are fighting against, being there and having the possibility to be top \u2013 we have to enjoy it and embrace it, maximise the opportunity that we have because we don\u2019t know what is going to happen.",
        "\u201cWe wanted to have a very different approach to the game, and we did it right from the beginning.\u201cThe team is back to its best. We wanted to prove we had that fire in the belly. I could see that in the last few days, and we prepared (for) the game well.",
        "\u201cMentally we arrived in the right mood and with the right level of energy. Everything went for us as well, which is important.\u201cWe\u2019ve had a couple of difficult weeks with very different games, with a lot of emotions involved. We\u2019re back to the top of the league \u2013 let\u2019s see what happens.\u201dWhile it was a night to remember for skipper Odegaard, it was one his predecessor will want to forget in a hurry. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang started for Chelsea for the first time since facing the Gunners on November 6 but lasted just 45 minutes before being substituted, having had nine touches \u2013 four of which were kick-offs.",
        "Arteta was full of praise for Odegaard and the example set by the Norway international.\u201cHe has 14 goals this season, his contribution to the team, his leadership skills, I\u2019m really pleased with him,\u201d he added.\u201cHe has been exceptional for us, his contribution every single day. I think he has done that (set the tone) on many occasions. What Martin has done this season deserves a lot of credit.\u201d",
        "Chelsea have now lost all six games under interim head coach Frank Lampard, who believes his players are \u201ctoo nice\u201d as they remain in the bottom half of the table. We can't change things overnight but we had better get there quickly  Frank Lampard  \u201cWe weren\u2019t good enough,\u201d he conceded.\u201cWe were too nice to play against, too passive. In possession we weren\u2019t playing balls over their press, or winning second balls.\u201cChelsea have been a big success for 20 years domestically and in the Champions League, at the moment we\u2019re not in that position.\u201cBut from the moment I\u2019ve been here it\u2019s been evident we\u2019re too nice as a team.\u201cWe can\u2019t change things overnight but we had better get there quickly because we have another game at the weekend and games to come.\u201d"
