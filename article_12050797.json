I'm glad to see he's serious about this and I can't wait to smash another legend, another former champion. He's got some good accolades and I can't wait to take that away from him, because he said this is going to be an easy fight. So what's going to happen when he loses and I make him bend the motherf****** knee?",
        "'I can't wait for Saturday because I'm going to silence the crowd again! Again! You think I can lose to a guy who dresses up in a velour suit? And his team? Look at these clowns! Sit your a** down!'",
        "As for Cejudo, 'Triple C'\u00a0 believes that he is still the current champion of the bantamweight division.\u00a0'I never lost the belt,' Cejudo said.\u00a0'So the way I see it, I'm the champ, he's the challenger, and you guys hired the right hitman. I'm here to do my job. Weight is good, I feel good. I'm doing my weight cut in the morning, I'm super light. I'm excited to put this clown six feet under.'\u00a0OddsAljamain Sterling to win - 10/11Henry Cejudo to win - 5/6Draw - 50/1All odds via Paddy Power and correct at the time of publication.\u00a0",
        "Prediction\u00a0It will be interesting to see if ring rust plays a big factor in this fight for Cejudo, seeing as he has not fought in three years.For Sterling, he may not be the best striker, but his wrestling and grappling are arguably one of the best in the division. If he can get the fight to the floor and take Cejudo's back, he can get the job done as his submission skills are second to none.",
        "Despite Sterling dominating his last fight against Dillashaw, it is fair to say that this weekend's clash with Cejudo will be his toughest yet.With Cejudo a former Olympic medalist in wrestling, Sterling may have a tough time taking him down. On the feet, Cejudo will have the edge and has proven to knock top strikers out over the years.Prediction: Aljamain Sterling via decision\u00a0"
