        "Security in London is the main focus of the royal stories as the countdown to the coronation continues.The Daily Mail splits its front page between a picture of the coronation rehearsal on The Mall and what it calls the \u201cbiggest security operation ever\u201d with 11,500 police officers and facial recognition cameras scanning the crowd.Metro says a \u201cring of steel\u201d is being placed around the King with security reviewed following the arrest of a man outside Buckingham Palace.Security is also the focus of the Daily Mirror front page as it warns police will take \u201cvery swift\u201d action against any protests which disrupt the coronation.The i takes a different royal slant, saying Charles is set to play a central role in improving relations between the UK and Europe after Brexit.",
        "A picture of the Queen Consort and a story on potential coronation protests make the front of The Daily Telegraph, but the lead focuses on a \u201cbest ever\u201d drug in the fight against Alzheimer\u2019s.That story also makes the front page of the Daily Express which says the new treatment, which slows the condition by more than a third in patients showing early symptoms, provides \u201creal hope\u201d for millions.The Times also features the Alzheimer\u2019s treatment and a coronation rehearsal picture, but it focuses on warnings from Conservative MPs that the party must avoid becoming the \u201cparty of nimbyism\u201d after dropping housebuilding targets.",
