        "Soldiers from the Royal Regiment of Scotland performing at the King\u2019s coronation have said it has been hard to find the time to practice during a \u201cseriously busy few months\u201d of combat training and exercises.",
        "Four servicemen will join a full band of 100 soldiers on Saturday as part of the pomp and pageantry in London.Drummer and Fusilier Declan Tytler, 26, from Penicuik in Midlothian, and piper Lance Corporal Ryan Steele, 29, from Auchenheath in South Lanarkshire, have spent the last few weeks learning and rehearsing new music to be performed at the historic occasion.But the soldiers said practice has not been on their minds much amid an intensive programme of combat training and exercises over the last few months.Fusilier Tytler said: \u201cYes we perform at ceremonial events, but most of the time we\u2019re either training, out on deployment, or jumping into whatever mission or military aid we\u2019re needed for. And when this is the case, drumming just isn\u2019t on the mind.\u201cI think it can be easy for the public to forget the other things we do when we aren\u2019t on their screens.\u201d",
        "L/Corp Steele said it has been a \u201cjuggling act\u201d to fit everything in.\u201cThe lead up to the coronation is certainly nothing like the ceremony and pageantry that you\u2019ll see on the day,\u201d he said.\u201cIn fact, it\u2019s a pretty quick transition from being in armoured vehicles and walking around in full 30kg kit in sweltering heat to being polished and presentable, stood in front of our new King.\u201d",
        "Both men, who also performed at the Queen\u2019s funeral last year, have recently returned from a military training exercise in Oman where they spent three months developing their core skills in challenging temperatures and terrain.",
        "Private Graeme Thomson, 22, from Eyemouth in the Borders, and Lance Corporal Ryan McAllister, 22, from Gourock, Inverclyde, will be marching as part of the ceremonial parade on Saturday.While the pressure is on to keep their steps in line, their day jobs have not stopped either.They recently engaged in a Nato readiness test with the Canadian Army, undertaking hundreds of hours of training across a vast area with challenging terrain, weather and obstacles, including mine fields and enemy camps.Pte Thomson said it had been \u201cgruelling\u201d, adding: \u201cThere\u2019s very little time for a break and you never know what\u2019s coming round the corner at any point.",
        "\u201cThere\u2019s no bed or restful sleep at the end of a day either \u2013 it\u2019s constant.\u201cWe set up tents and slept outside in the hours we could manage, but with the low March temperatures and the next test always around the corner, you\u2019re in a perpetual state of being on red alert.\u201dL/Cpl McAllister said: \u201cFinding time to practice for the coronation has had to fit in around a seriously busy few months full of exercises and our wider combat training regime.",
        "\u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\u201cI joined the Army for the challenge and the opportunities it brings, and getting to step into these events that will be marked in the history books forever is definitely a bonus.\u201cIt\u2019s something I never thought I\u2019d be doing when I signed up.\u201d"
