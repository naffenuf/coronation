        "'I was so young I had kissed, like, only one person. I had never had a high school sweetheart or anything,' she confessed.'And so I tended to date older people because those were the people I was around.'The fashion industry personality then expressed that she had matured significantly ever since her early years of dating.'I got put in situations where one day I'd wake up and be like, \"How did I get here?\" I have no idea what I'm doing, and I need help. And being able to ask for that help was amazing. That's what real growing up means, not being afraid to ask,' she said."
