        "The King must address fundamental diplomatic questions, such as foreign visitsKing Charles III may choose Australia and New Zealand as his first foreign visits following the coronation this weekend.\u00a0",
        "After being officially sworn in as monarch, the King must now address fundamental diplomatic questions, such as foreign visits to other commonwealth countries.\u00a0Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese had a private audience with the king just prior to the coronation, during which he extended a formal invitation for a state visit.\u00a0New Zealand prime minister Chris Hipkins also did the same when he was a guest at Westminster Abbey.\u00a0Both countries are growing in republican sentiment, with middle-aged voters trailing away from notions of monarchy.\u00a0",
        "King Charles and Queen Camilla appear to making plans to visit both countries before anti-monarchist movements are given the chance to build momentum.\u00a0If he was to visit the country as part of his overseas tour this autumn, it would mark the first time the former prince has been to Australia in five years.According to the Telegraph, one source close to the King said: 'He visited Canada only last year, so it would make sense for him to visit Australia and New Zealand, though the invitation has to come from them, so it's not something the King or the Government can decide unilaterally.'\u00a0He has always maintained the the decision of commonwealth countries to keep the British monarch as their head of state rests solely with the nation's own people.",
        "Regardless, he still hopes that commonwealth countries will remain as engaged as possible.\u00a0Queen Elizabeth II is the only monarch to have visited Australia during their reign.\u00a0"
