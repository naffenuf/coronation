When officers arrived he was still inside the property.The wrestler described him as being dressed in black and having a black mask on, and 'stared at her' until she started screaming.Deville said she ignored most of the messages Thomas sent until he broke into her home, checking outside the property after her alarm system was triggered.She told a judge at his bail hearing: 'He had black clothing on, and a black mask and he was just standing there staring at me. I looked up I saw him.'I was terrified! I started screaming I don't even know what I said what the 'f' are you doing here? What do you want?'",
        "Thomas sent her messages saying: 'I'm going to summer slam with you as your boyfriend' and 'Im going to force you to do what I want, You're gonna give me what I want.'Another said: 'When I get my hands on you I'll make sure you understand what pain you have put me through.'The final message she received before Thomas broke into her home said: 'Hey baby look outside, I'm by your pool and I'm going to kill that little b***h that's inside with you.'",

        "In a statement released after his sentence, Deville said: 'Thank you to everyone who has reached out today.\u00a0",
        "'After almost three years we finally got some closure last week. I am happy and healthy and have amazing people by my side.'To say it's over feels odd but I am beyond grateful for the support and help I received over the past three years from HCSO, Tampa PD, to everyone in the courts, attorneys, friends, security and so so many more.'I have a lot to say pertaining to this situation which I feel can help a lot of people in similar situations now that the legalities are over. BUT for now thank you.'"
