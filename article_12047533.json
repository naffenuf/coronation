        "Rory McIlroy feels it is a shame that Lee Westwood, Ian Poulter and Sergio Garcia will not someday captain Europe\u2019s Ryder Cup team after they quit the DP World Tour.",
        "The trio stepped aside after being sanctioned for joining rival LIV Golf, thus rendering them ineligible for inclusion when the match against the United States begins in Rome in September.On Thursday, Westwood spoke out against the European Tour following the controversy, seemingly closing the door on any hope of a return in the future.And McIlroy said: \u201cI think it\u2019s a shame that you\u2019ve got the highest points score ever in the Ryder Cup and two guys that when they look back on their career, that\u2019s probably going to be at least a big chunk of their legacy is the roles that they have played in the Ryder Cup for Europe.\u201cFor those three guys to not captain Europe one day, it\u2019s a shame. But as the DP World Tour said in their statement, at the end of the day that was their choice and they knew that these were potentially going to be the consequences of those choices and of those actions and here we are.\u201cYeah, it\u2019s certainly a shame.\u201dEurope\u2019s captain, Luke Donald, echoed McIlroy\u2019s sentiments and said he is sad that the three will not be available to represent the side.",
        "Donald, who will lead the Europe team as they seek to win the Ryder Cup for the first time since 2018, felt sorry that the situation had come to this.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s sad we\u2019ve got to this point but this was always a possibility,\u201d Donald told BBC Sport. \u201cI played with all three and they\u2019ve been stalwarts of, and given a lot to, both the Ryder Cup and European Tour.\u201cI have a little more clarity now. I know they\u2019re not an option to play in, or be any part of my team. It is a shame. They\u2019ve got a lot of history when it comes to the Ryder Cup.\u201cUltimately this is their choice and I wish them well. They feel like this was the best choice for them and now I\u2019ve got choices to make that are best for me.\u201cThere are generational shifts throughout the history of the Ryder Cup and maybe this is one.\u201cWe certainly have plenty of great players to look at and pick from and I\u2019m certainly excited about how everyone has played this year so far.\u201dDonald was made captain in 2022 after Henrik Stenson was dismissed for joining in the Saudi-backed LIV tour.He will be without three of Europe\u2019s most successful performers in the contest, with Westwood having featured as a player a record 11 times and Poulter unbeaten in singles across his seven appearances. Garcia is Europe\u2019s all-time record points scorer.",
        "Donald added: \u201cThere\u2019s great momentum with European golf. We\u2019ve already had seven winners in the US [this season] and a bunch of people who haven\u2019t played in the Ryder Cup have played great this year on the DP World Tour, so I\u2019m excited about the make-up of this team.\u201d"
