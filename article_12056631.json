        "Tory MP Penny Mordaunt played a leading role at King Charles' CoronationCORONATION LIVEBLOG: Click here to follow live updates throughout today\u00a0Penny Mordaunt played a leading role at King Charles' Coronation as she carried sword at the historic event in Westminster Abbey - but social media users were in stitches after noticing something about her outfit.\u00a0",
        "The Leader of the House of Commons, 50, was hailed a breakout star for her role\u00a0at yesterday's Coronation, where as Lord President of the Privy Council she was asked to hold the ceremonial sword.Dressed in a teal blue dress with gold detail and a matching cape, Ms Mordaunt carried the 17th-century Sword of State into the Abbey before presenting it to the King in his throne.\u00a0But social media users joked that her outfit was reminiscent of the budget retailer Poundland's logo, which also features a gold emblem on a teal blue background.\u00a0One person said: 'I\u00a0see Penny Mordaunt is giving @Poundland\u00a0free advertising today.'\u00a0",
        "Another quipped: 'Penny Mordaunt the Poundland princess'.A third chimed in: 'In for a Penny Mordaunt, in for a Poundland #Coronation'.But Ms Mordaunt's appearance at the King's Coronation seemed to win over the nation's hearts as heaped on praise for her confiedent\u00a0performance.Notable figures including a number of fellow MPs complimented her, with Labour MP Emily Thornberry tweeting: 'Got to say it, @PennyMordaunt looks damn fine! The sword bearer steals the show.'Author and columnist Caitlin Moran also commented on the social media buzz around Ms Mordaunt's role, saying: 'Penny Mordaunt's sword is the 'Pippa Middleton's Bum' of the Coronation.'Labour MP Chris Bryant said in a tweet: 'The Penny is mightier than the sword.'",
        "It was the first time in history that the Jewelled Sword of Offering has been carried and presented to the monarch by a woman.\u00a0",
        "The intricately detailed sword was made for George IV's coronation in 1821, It is encrusted with diamonds, rubies and emeralds and is decorated with jewelled roses, thistles and shamrocks.\u00a0Later in the ceremony Ms Mordaunt exchanged the Sword of State for the Jewelled Sword of Offering and delivered it to the archbishop.The second sword was briefly clipped to the King's coronation sword belt and then after a proclamation by the archbishop, the King stepped forward and offered up the sword.It was then placed on the altar and redeemed with 'redemption money' by Ms Mordaunt.The sword was later drawn and she carried it in its 'naked' form - without its scabbard - before the King for the rest of the service.The Jewelled Sword of Offering has a hilt encrusted with diamonds, rubies and emeralds and a scabbard decorated with jewelled roses, thistles and shamrocks.It symbolises royal power and being able to decide between good and evil, and the King accepting his duty and knightly virtues.Asked about being around the King with a 'big pointy sword', Ms Mordaunt admitted she did feel 'a terrible weight of responsibility'.",
        "Speaking to The Times' Red Box Politics podcast, Mordaunt disclosed she had been 'doing some press-ups' in preparation for the role.\u00a0She added she had been practising in rehearsals with weighted replicas, and her experience in the Navy helped prepare her to stand for long periods of time without fainting.\u00a0Last September, she officially announced the Queen's death and proclaimed Charles as Britain's new King in front of the Accession Council.\u00a0She was applauded online for doing an 'outstanding job' during Saturday morning's 'moving and sombre' ceremony.Twitter users pointed out that Ms Mordaunt, who was appointed to her new role by Prime Minister Liz Truss, had little time to prepare for the Accession Proclamation but still managed to be 'very polished' and spoke with 'authority', according to spectators."
