        "Hard to imagine now, but Prince Andrew was once a favourite with his rascally young nephew Prince Harry.",
        "No longer. These days, just about the only thing that unites them is their status as royal outcasts \u2014 albeit for very different reasons.The depth of the public\u2019s disapproval of its two errant \u2018spares\u2019 to the throne was revealed by the Mail yesterday. In a poll of 11,450 people commissioned by former Conservative deputy chairman Lord Ashcroft, only 22 per cent had a \u2018favourable\u2019 view of Harry, while just seven per cent could bear to favour Andrew. The survey ranked the two princes among the three least popular royals (the Duchess of Sussex had an 18 per cent rating).It\u2019s easy to forget it now, but there had been a time when they were both liked by the public and were close to each other.When Harry was a boy they bonded over their mutual interest in military feats. Time and again, he\u2019d get his uncle to talk about his heroics as a helicopter pilot in the Falklands war \u2014 which Andrew, of course, was only too willing to do. Doubtless those stories made a great impression on the young prince, who\u2019d later have his own tales to recount about shooting Afghan insurgents from a helicopter.",
        "Some of the parallels between them are uncanny. Both fell in love with minor American actresses \u2014 Meghan Markle and Koo Stark.",
        "In their youth, both led rackety lives \u2014 dating strings of beautiful women and revelling in their reputation as handsome playboys.Tales abounded, meanwhile, of the rudeness of both uncle and nephew, and of their sense of entitlement. And, of course, much of this goes back to their over-indulged childhoods.The first thing to be said is they were both Mummy\u2019s boys. In Andrew\u2019s case, he was always the Queen\u2019s favourite child \u2014 to the point that he was encouraged to kiss her on both cheeks, while Prince Charles just bowed.Like the Queen with her spare, Princess Diana indulged her own by allowing him to run wild. Although she didn\u2019t claim to have favourites, she also went to considerable lengths to make him feel important, even calling him Good King Harry.From early childhood, both spares were much naughtier than their siblings. \u2018The baby is adorable. All in all, he\u2019s going to be terribly spoilt by all of us, I\u2019m sure,\u2019 the Queen wrote presciently about Andrew in a letter to a cousin.Adorable-looking, perhaps, but his nanny called him \u2018Baby Grumpling\u2019 for his temper tantrums and Prince Philip called him \u2018The Boss\u2019 \u2014 a reference to Andrew\u2019s determination to get his own way. Appearing at a film premiere with a black eye, Philip confided that \u2018The Boss\u2019 had done it. At the time, everyone thought he meant the Queen.",
        "Rarely punished, Andrew hid the knives and forks when a footman was laying the table and tied a sentry\u2019s shoelaces together. He snuck a whoopee cushion under the Queen Mother, sprinkled itching powder in his mother\u2019s bed and climbed onto the roof of Buckingham Palace to bend the TV aerial. Despite being unable to watch one of her favourite horse races on television, the Queen thought her second son was hilarious.",
        "For the most part, Diana was equally indulgent. She just laughed when Harry tugged at his music teacher\u2019s trousers and piped up: \u2018I can see your willy!\u2019And neither she nor Prince Charles intervened when Harry and his brother tackled their royal protection officer Inspector Ken Wharfe. One of them, said Wharfe, would land \u2018punches towards my groin, which, if they connected, would make me kneel over in agony.\u2019 No prizes for guessing which prince he meant.Whenever Harry\u2019s 60-year-old nanny Olga Powell tried to reprimand him, he\u2019d snap back: \u2018Go to your room, Olga.\u2019And, of course, it was Harry\u2019s idea to run a go-kart track across his father\u2019s pristine lawn at Highgrove.\u2018We can\u2019t do that because Papa will go mad,\u2019 warned Prince William.\u2018It doesn\u2019t matter about that,\u2019 said his irrepressible little brother. Indeed, whenever William tried to restrain him, Harry would say: \u2018I can do what I like, because I\u2019m not going to be King. You can\u2019t because you are.\u2019",
        "At school, neither Harry nor Andrew were the sharpest pencils. Indeed, Harry famously managed to score only two A-levels at Eton \u2014 a D in geography and a B in art \u2014 though at least he was good at games.Not Andrew: as well as failing to impress in the classroom, he did little to distinguish himself on the sports fields of Gordonstoun, his Scottish boarding school. Not that he seemed to mind.",
        "And here we come to the first big difference between uncle and nephew. Coddled by his mother, Andrew seemed to view himself as the centre of the universe.Nothing much knocked his large ego off course, not even his relative unpopularity at school. Fellow pupils remember him as \u2018boastful\u2019 and \u2018big-headed\u2019. One recalled: \u2018He had a bit of the \u201cI am the Prince\u201d about him when he arrived . . . The ribbings he got were unmerciful.\u2019In his last year at Gordonstoun, according to former fellow-pupil Lucilla Houseman, \u2018he didn\u2019t shine at anything. Well, not quite \u2014 he loved having a good time. In fact, the story that went round the school was that he failed some O-levels because he spent all his time reading trashy magazines and comics.\u2019And Harry? At Eton, which he entered at 14, he was more focused on rebellion. Always competitive with his older brother, he reflected later that he\u2019d felt like a \u2018nullity\u2019, an \u2018unbrilliant boy\u2019 who was second-best.",
        "Some of Harry\u2019s pranks were extremely childish, like balancing a book on the top of a door so that it fell on a teacher\u2019s head. But he also got into trouble for having a hair-trigger temper, once kicking in a window during a dispute with another boy over a girl they both fancied.\u2018Harry was like a firecracker,\u2019 said one teacher. \u2018When other pupils saw him coming, they used to pass a by-now familiar warning: \u201cDon\u2019t light the blue touch paper\u201d. In other words: don\u2019t give him the slightest excuse to vent his spleen.\u2019Summer holidays were taken with the family of his friend Henry van Straubenzee at their house near Rock in Cornwall \u2014 which attracted so many public-school teenagers that it became known as \u2018Sloane Square-on-Sea\u2019. The place was awash with booze and pretty young girls.On one occasion, Harry got drunk, and started throwing around cider bottles. \u2018He was vomiting behind the wall,\u2019 said one girl.",
        "\u2018He\u2019s one of the most revolting people I\u2019ve ever come across\u2019.The teenaged Harry embraced his status as a bad boy. In pubs around Highgrove, he not only developed a taste for vodka but also started smoking marijuana. And, at Eton, he soon became known as \u2018Hash Harry\u2019 or \u2018His Royal High-ness\u2019.",
        "He could also be rude and offensive. He got into at least one fight in a pub, and was thrown out for calling its French chef a \u2018f***ing frog\u2019.Andrew was rather more careful whom he insulted. But staff and protection officers appear to have been fair game. Ken Wharfe recalled he was once moved from a window seat on a plane because he was obstructing Andrew\u2019s view. \u2018His manners,\u2019 Wharfe said, \u2018are just awful.\u2019And an aide claimed: \u2018He treats his staff in a shocking, appalling way. He\u2019s been incredibly rude to his personal protection officers, literally throwing things on the ground and demanding they \u201cf***ing pick them up\u201d.\u2019There\u2019s no denying that Andrew and Harry were girl-magnets in their late teens and 20s. As we now know from Harry himself, he lost his virginity at 16 to a woman three years his senior in a field.At the same age, Andrew \u2014 or Prince Heartthrob as he was dubbed \u2014 was visiting the Montreal Olympics in Canada with his parents, and being bombarded with telephone numbers and requests for dates. Certainly, Andrew didn\u2019t have to make much effort to have pretty girls tumbling into his arms.Nor did Harry, who used to employ the chat-up line: \u2018How would you like to come back to my palace for a drink?\u2019",
        "At 21, Andrew was named one of the world\u2019s most eligible bachelors by People magazine. Soon his long roster of girlfriends, often ravishing blondes, had earned him yet another nickname: Randy Andy.As the author Margaret Holder commented: \u2018The playboy image is not one Prince Andrew discourages. He\u2019s been seen many times on party yachts, and he thinks it enhances his reputation. Attracting luscious young ladies makes him feel young.\u2019He may have winced, however, when topless model Vicki Hodge earned \u00a340,000 from the News of the World for details of their brief fling in Barbados, as well as for a photograph of 23-year-old Andrew standing naked in the surf, swinging his swimming trunks over his head.Vicki said she\u2019d discovered why his previous affairs had been so brief: he finished far too quickly. She\u2019d told him to slow things down by counting to himself, but he\u2019d put her off by counting out loud.While Harry tended to pick girls sensible enough to shun the limelight, Andrew went for a very different sort \u2014 often models and actresses. Then, in 1981, he had his first real love affair.American starlet Koo Stark had met him in Tramp nightclub in London. Koo had approached Andrew and his friends, who were making a racket on the dance floor, and asked them to turn down the volume. \u2018Stop being so boring,\u2019 said the prince. \u2018We\u2019re having a great time \u2014 come and join us.\u2019The affair eventually petered out in 1983. His subsequent marriage to Fergie, in 1986, was passionate at first but foundered within six years.Harry also had many flings, but \u2014 unlike Andrew \u2014 went to some length to keep them out of the headlines. He was also better at choosing bed-mates who didn\u2019t kiss and tell, and had serious relationships with at least two of them.",
        "Sometimes, however, the media got wind of sleazy antics he\u2019d have preferred to keep secret. In 2012, pictures emerged of him playing strip billiards in Las Vegas.It was reminiscent of an incident in 2001, when Andrew was photographed on board a luxury yacht off the Thai island of Phuket, surrounded by a group of topless young women.He also toured the red-light district of Phuket. In one go-go bar \u2014 bearing the motto \u2018good food, cold drinks, hot girls\u2019 \u2014 he danced with half-naked young women.A regular said: \u2018You certainly wouldn\u2019t get a member of the Thai royal family in a place like this. The area is very raunchy and many of the girls are prostitutes.\u2019What does a royal spare actually do? For Harry and Andrew, there was an obvious answer: join the military. In Harry\u2019s case, this was what he\u2019d always wanted to do anyway, ever since Diana had introduced her lover Major James Hewitt into the household. From the beginning, Harry was enthralled by \u2018Uncle James\u2019 and his tales of Army life.Hewitt also had his regimental tailor run up a little camouflage uniform for the prince, which he hardly ever took off. And he took Harry to Combermere Barracks, home of the Household Cavalry. There, he clambered on a tank and announced: \u2018I\u2019m going to be a soldier when I grow up.\u2019And Andrew? Predictably he did what was expected and joined the Navy.Both Andrew and Harry did well in their military careers. But after these ended, they once again had to find something to occupy their time.",
        "Attempts to deploy Andrew as an asset for the royal Firm were not always a success. On a trip to the U.S., his behaviour was so bad that he was dubbed the Duke of Yob by the British Press.The American media called it \u2018the most unpleasant royal visit since they burned the White House in 1812\u2019.A chance to redeem himself came when he was appointed Britain\u2019s roving trade ambassador, but he proved to be a disaster. Too often, the Foreign Office said, he refused to stick to the agreed itinerary and \u2018left a trail of glass in his wake\u2019.Andrew was also burning through hundreds of thousands a year of taxpayers\u2019 money. Living up to his latest nickname \u2014 Airmiles Andy \u2014he criss-crossed the globe to attend golf tournaments and various social occasions.The rest, of course, is recent history. Andrew\u2019s disgrace, already under way when he gave that ruinous Newsnight interview about his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, was compounded when he paid millions to Virginia Giuffre.Harry fared rather better than his uncle. As he took on more royal duties in his early 30s, he seemed to show signs of maturing from spoiled prince to cheeky charmer. And then came Meghan.While Andrew was demoted by his mother, Harry quit voluntarily \u2014 then treated the world to an increasingly tiresome whinge-fest about how poorly he\u2019d been treated.Since his autobiography, his popularity has plummeted. But as yesterday\u2019s poll of how the public rates its royals shows, there is one prince who will seemingly always curry less favour, his uncle Andrew.Adapted from Windsor Spares: The Prince Harry and Prince Andrew\u2019s Soap Opera! by Nigel Cawthorne, to be published by Gibson Square on May 4 at \u00a39.99. \u00a9 Nigel Cawthorne 2023.
