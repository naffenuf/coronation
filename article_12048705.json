        "Inside Ukraine: A Portrait of a Country and its People\u00a0by Bogdan Logvynenko (Batsford \u00a325, 320pp)",
        "Prior to Putin\u2019s brutal invasion of Ukraine, Logvynenko found that when he spoke of his home country, its image was defined by football, political jokes and disasters.This led in 2016 to five years of travel around the country by the volunteers of Ukra\u00efner, an organisation that aims to explain Ukraine to its inhabitants and promote it to the wider world.\u00a0From beautiful landscapes to wild honey farmers, potters, railwaymen, artists and sheep-breeders, this book is a beautiful celebration of the land and its people \u2014 and more timely than ever."
