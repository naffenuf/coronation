        "Wales\u2019 devolved Government should be given control of Crown properties worth billions, in order to drive prosperity, Plaid Cymru\u2019s Westminster leader has said.",
        "Liz Saville Roberts said devolving control over the Crown Estate\u2019s properties in Wales could help end a \u201cbegging bowl\u201d culture, and give Cardiff more say over financial decision-making.She also suggested it could be used to provide better energy security and ease the rising cost of living in Wales.Ms Saville Roberts said it was an \u201capposite\u201d time to discuss devolution of the estate, with the King\u2019s coronation taking place over the weekend.The Crown Estate is an independent company which belongs to the monarch for the duration of their reign, though the revenue from its \u00a316 billion property portfolio flows directly to the Treasury.",
        "The Sovereign Grant, which pays for the King\u2019s official duties as head of state, is currently set at 25% of the Crown Estate\u2019s annual profits, including a 10% uplift to pay for the refurbishment of Buckingham Palace.The estate\u2019s holdings north of the border were devolved to Scotland in 2016, and its revenue now goes to the Scottish Government.The Crown Estate owns the UK seabed out to 12 nautical miles, and Ms Saville Roberts said an arrangement similar to Scotland would give Wales a direct say in how the profits from new floating wind farms planned off the Welsh coast would be spent.She told the PA news agency: \u201cThe Crown Estate should be devolved to Wales because there is now so much potential, particularly with floating offshore wind, for us in Wales, to make sure that this isn\u2019t just another extractive exercise.\u201d",
        "The Dwyfor Meirionnydd MP suggested that if the profits from this were in the hands of the devolved Government in Cardiff Bay, it could be used to provide better energy security and lower heating costs for Welsh homes.She said it could be a step in transforming Wales\u2019 struggling economy, telling PA: \u201cOne of the criticisms that any Welsh politician on the left will face is that we are forever asking for more money, that we are asking for the Barnett Formula to be revised. The Crown Estate should be devolved to Wales because there is now so much potential, particularly with floating offshore wind, for us in Wales, to make sure that this isn\u2019t just another extractive exercise  Liz Saville Roberts, Plaid Cymru\u2019s Westminster leader  \u201cI am very interested in what are the mechanisms that we could bring to Wales that would allow us to build our own economy more effectively, and not to be an adjunct.\u201dThe Plaid MP said previous attempts to raise the issue with the Conservative Westminster Government had been a \u201cnon-starter\u201d.She said her party would be \u201ccertainly pushing\u201d the cause if Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s Labour were to win the next general election.\u201cIt would be deeply hypocritical of Labour to ascend to power in Westminster, when they have held power in Wales since 1999, not to act on something where their longest standing Government have come out in favour of it,\u201d she added.",
        "Ms Saville Roberts, a member of the Privy Council who describes herself as a republican, said she had long raised the matter before it was known a coronation would take place this year.She said: \u201cIt is apposite now of course, because people are considering how the royal family are funded.\u201dSpeaking ahead of the coronation weekend, the Plaid MP said: \u201cI think in terms of the cost-of-living crisis and people making the comparison between a massive public expenditure on a coronation which is not constitutionally necessary, it does make people think about where priorities lie.\u201cThere will be people on the day of the coronation who will have a wonderful day, they will look forward to it, they will enjoy it and I really hope they do. I wish them all the best for that.\u201dShe added: \u201cI want to play my part in building Wales as a nation where we stand on our own two feet, where we are confident of moving into the future, where we are not having to put out the begging bowl, and to work with the people of Wales on small and large suggestions about how to do that.\u201cI think the devolution of the Crown Estate, it feels fair, it feels equitable, and we could do so much with this.",
        "\u201cIt could be one critical step that could make so much difference to the Welsh economy in the furthest westernmost regions of north and south Wales.\u201cI ask the Government of the day to engage with this, and I would ask Conservatives who say that Welsh Government should get on with the day job, well, this is part of the day job.\u201cGrowing the economy is part of the day job.\u201dMinisters have previously said they are not in favour of Ms Saville Roberts\u2019 proposals.While serving as secretary of state for Wales, Simon Hart last year told the House of Commons there was \u201cno public appetite at all in Wales to devolve the Crown Estate\u201d.The Conservative MP, now Government chief whip, also suggested at the time that devolving the estate would \u201c fragment the market and delay the further development of key projects\u201d in the floating offshore wind sector.A Crown Estate spokesman said: \u201cThe Crown Estate works closely with the Welsh Government and Natural Resources Wales to manage land and the seabed sustainably over the long term and to bring broader economic, social and environmental benefits to Wales.\u201d"
