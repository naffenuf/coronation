        "Northwestern guard Boo Buie said Monday that he will return to school this fall for a fifth season instead of entering the NBA draft.",
        "Buie made the announcement in a video posted to social media, adding the caption, \"Not finished.\"On April 2, Buie said he was throwing his name into the draft but would maintain his eligibility.The scoring leader on the Big Ten's second-place team averaged 17.3 points, 4.5 assists, 3.4 rebounds and 1.1 steals in 34 games in the 2022-23 season while earning first-team All-Big Ten honors in voting by the media. He knocked down 64 3-pointers while helping Northwestern reach the NCAA Tournament for just the second time in program history.Buie made 86.9 percent of his free throws as Northwestern reached the second round of the tournament, where it lost to UCLA.Overall, Buie has averages of 13.4 points, 3.9 assists and 2.6 rebounds in 115 games (94 starts) for the Wildcats. He has made 198 3-pointers and recorded 94 steals.The success comes after Buie was a largely unwanted high school player at Gould Academy in Bethel, Maine. The Wildcats were the lone major program to offer him a scholarship.--Field Level Media"
