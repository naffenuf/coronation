        "The Belgian Bullet wowed the Crucible crowd with his attacking approach on his way to winning his first World Championship title on Monday night.At the post-tournament party, World Snooker Tour president Barry Hearn said, \u2018I saw a bit of Alex Higgins coming back into my world tonight\u2019, as he welcomed Brecel to the dancefloor.The 28-year-old then paid tribute to the Hurricane - the maverick two-time world champion - by staying up drinking with his friends, family and defeated opponent Mark Selby until 4am on Tuesday morning.\u2018I saw a lot of people comparing me to Alex Higgins and that\u2019s amazing, it\u2019s a huge compliment,\u2019 said Brecel, who travelled back to Belgium later on Tuesday with a sore head but a \u00a3500,000 cheque as well as the trophy.",
        "\u2018That\u2019s the way I want to play. I want to be entertaining. Winning is not the most important thing. It\u2019s great to see the crowds enjoying it and people loving it online as well. That\u2019s the most important thing for me.\u2019At Monday night\u2019s party, Selby surprised Brecel by getting the DJ to play We Are The Champions by Queen.The gracious runner-up also hailed Brecel\u2019s victory as \u2018great for snooker\u2019 \u2013 and the Belgian believes the swashbuckling way he won could be a game-changer for the sport.",
        "\u2018It\u2019s the style the people want to see,\u2019 said Brecel. \u2018I think it can have an impact on the way the game is played.\u2018I don\u2019t want to sound cocky, but I think I\u2019m a nice world champion because I play the game in a very attacking way.\u2018It\u2019s not always going to work because I\u2019ll miss shots and leave my opponent easy chances. But if it works, it\u2019s fascinating to watch.\u2019Brecel famously boasted before the tournament that he did not practise, spending his time partying and playing darts instead. He also prepared for his quarter-final win over Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan by getting as \u2018drunk as hell\u2019 back in Belgium.\u2018I\u2019ve just been partying a lot, going out and having late nights and no practising,\u2019 explained Brecel. \u2018It was a different approach this time - and it worked!\u2019Brecel had been tipped as a future world champion ever since he became the youngest player to appear at the Crucible aged 17 in 2012. However, he failed to win a match here in five visits before this year.\u2018After my record here, not winning a game after five attempts, I wasn\u2019t expecting to win it any time soon,\u2019 admitted Brecel.",
        "\u2018So to win it this year is absolutely amazing. It was the same thing that Joe Johnson did in 1986 - never winning a match here and then winning it.",
        "\u2018It\u2019s a dream come true and whatever happens now in my career I can say I\u2019m a world champion.\u2018I am only 28, with so much time left in my career. Hopefully there are many more to follow.\u2019Brecel is the youngest Crucible winner since Shaun Murphy in 2005 and the first world champion from mainland Europe.\u2018I was so nervous because I just wanted it to happen for Belgium and for Europe,\u2019 he added. \u2018Now it has happened, I can\u2019t wait to see what it brings to the world. It\u2019s going to explode.\u2019"
