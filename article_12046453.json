        "Record-breaking sharpshooter Erling Haaland says treble-chasing Manchester City are attacking the run-in with momentum and the right mindset.",
        "Pep Guardiola\u2019s men kicked off a manic May with a comprehensive 3-0 victory against West Ham at the Etihad Stadium on Wednesday night.Second-half efforts from Nathan Ake and Phil Foden came either side of Haaland\u2019s 51st goal of the season as City secured a ninth straight Premier League win.The result saw Guardiola\u2019s men move back ahead of Arsenal at the summit as they eye a fifth title triumph in six seasons, with talk of a treble continuing in the background.",
        "\u201cIt was not easy,\u201d Haaland said after beating West Ham. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy when they come and play like that but we scored with Nath and then it kind of opened up more. In the end (it was) a so important three points.\u201cWe are in good shape, the mentality\u2019s right. The only thing we can do is focus on the next game and try to win the next game.\u201cNow it\u2019s Leeds, we have to focus on the game, we have to only think of that game and to try to win it.\u201dSaturday\u2019s league match at home to Leeds is followed by the first leg of their mouth-watering Champions League semi-final at Real Madrid on Tuesday.City are looking to reach the European showpiece for the second time in the club\u2019s history, with AC Milan or Inter Milan lying in wait in Istanbul on June 10.",
        "A week earlier comes a fascinating all-Manchester FA Cup final against rivals United, providing Haaland with the chance to end a fine first season in unforgettable fashion.\u201cPotentially nine games left and I\u2019m enjoying it,\u201d he said. \u201cTo have games all the time, this is something I love so we will see.\u201dSuch occasions are why Haaland join City, whose lofty expectations he has somehow surpassed since joining from Borussia Dortmund last summer.\u201cIt\u2019s a bit unreal,\u201d Haaland said. \u201cI am really proud and I\u2019m happy. I just have to thank all my team-mates and the staff for making it possible.\u201dHaaland got a guard of honour from staff and team-mates as he left the pitch after surpassing Andy Cole and Alan Shearer\u2019s previous record.\u201cIt was a nice moment,\u201d he told club media. \u201cIt was really painful to get hit in the back by everyone but it was a nice moment.\u201dNot only did Haaland make history on Wednesday but there was a significant landmark for Guardiola, with Foden\u2019s deflected volley City\u2019s 1,000th goal in all competitions under him.\u201cI am enjoying it every single game,\u201d Haaland said of life as a striker under the former Barcelona and Bayern Munich boss.\u201cIt\u2019s hard, he demands a lot, but I try to do my best to develop and do my best on the pitch. That\u2019s what you have to do \u2013 nothing more to do than do your best.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure and I love to play under Pep. I\u2019m really happy to have him as a coach.\u201dCity are not the only English team going for continental glory as West Ham have a Europa Conference League semi-final date against AZ Alkmaar looming large.Lifting that trophy would be huge for the east London club but Premier League survival has yet to be assured and Manchester United arrive on Sunday evening.West Ham defender Aaron Cresswell told WHTV: \u201cIt\u2019s a four-game season now and we\u2019re four points clear of the bottom three.",
        "\u201cSo, three or four points or whatever it might take to keep us up, we just want to get it sooner rather than later.\u201cWe\u2019ve also got a European semi-final which are going to be two massive games, but obviously every game between now and the end of the season is going to be vital.\u201cOnce the lads are back, I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be back by Sunday and be raring to go, so as I say every game from now is massive.\u201cIt\u2019s Man United in the late game on a Sunday night and the crowd will be up for it and we want to get the three points.\u201d"
