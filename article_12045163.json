Cause you can't run in them) and say goodbye to my working life as I know it,' she said at the time.'I've lived and breathed Sweaty Betty (in sickness and in health, quite literally) but now it's time to live, continue to build my own brands whilst managing my incredible talent within Ministry of Talent \u2013 which I just adore.'The Ministry Of Talent covers social media influencers across fashion, beauty, fitness and more and creates partnerships between bloggers and brands."
