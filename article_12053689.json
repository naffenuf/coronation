        "Eddie Howe insists he is not losing any sleep over Liverpool\u2019s bid to deny Newcastle a place in the Premier League top four.",
        "Jurgen Klopp\u2019s men, who are responsible for two of the third-placed Magpies\u2019 four league defeats to date this season, have belatedly put together a consistent run of form, winning each of their last five matches to close to within six points.That gap could have been reduced to just three points \u2013 albeit with the Reds having played two games more \u2013 by the time Howe\u2019s side runs out to face Arsenal on Sunday with the chasing pack mounting a late sprint.",
        "Asked about the prospect, the 45-year-old said: \u201cDo I lose any sleep? No, I don\u2019t lose any sleep over it, but I\u2019m aware that Liverpool are a top team. Does it surprise me they\u2019re able to go on a run of wins? No.\u201cThere are other teams there as well, but we\u2019re not focusing on that. We haven\u2019t done that all season. We haven\u2019t focused on where we are, who\u2019s around us, form of teams. We\u2019ve just focused on ourselves and that\u2019s all we can do.\u201cWe have a tough run of fixtures, but I think at the same time, a great run of fixtures because every game is important. They\u2019re great occasions and we\u2019ll look to carry on our good form.\u201dBrighton\u2019s stoppage-time win over Manchester United on Thursday evening left Newcastle two points clear of the men from Old Trafford in the race for the top four with five games each remaining.",
        "They remain 10 better off than the Seagulls \u2013 who have a game in hand \u2013 in sixth, but victory over the Gunners would not only all-but end the visitors\u2019 title hopes, but nudge the Magpies closer to Champions League qualification.",
        "However Howe, whose team have won eight of their last nine games, is preparing for the battle to go to the wire.He said: \u201cNothing\u2019s done and I didn\u2019t expect it to be done. Were competing against elite teams who will fight to the end and we have to do the same.\u201cOur five games we need to give our best preparation and focus to because the fight that we\u2019re in could go right down to the end of the season.\u201dHowe and opposite number Mikel Arteta were involved in an angry touchline exchange during the reverse fixture in January, which ended 0-0, but the former Bournemouth boss has only respect for the Spaniard.He said: \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of resect for Mikel, he\u2019s done an incredible job. You have to admire everything that he\u2019s done, whether that\u2019s recruitment, coaching, everything, so there\u2019s a lot of respect from me to him.\u201cWithin a game, you\u2019ll always have moments where you come up against opponents and there\u2019s a bit of confrontation. I think that\u2019s natural, that\u2019s part of the job, but there are certainly no issues from my side.\u201d"
