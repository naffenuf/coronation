        "A shower with a white and blue-tiled wall was directly behind the mother of two. The Golden Globe winner donned a blue-striped, button up and excitedly stated towards the camera, 'Hello, hello. Thank you so much. I can't believe this.'\u00a0",
        "'Thank you for letting me in. Get eyeball to eyeball. Thank you for this whole show. This whole world being - thank you. Thank you so much,' Drew further expressed.\u00a0The actress then paid recognition to the writers that contribute to her popular talk show, which began airing in 2020.\u00a0'Oh, my goodness. Okay. Also I want to thank Chelsey, Christina, Liz, our amazing, amazing writers. This is definitely for them and every single person who makes the show.'\u00a0'There is no I in my. Just ours and we. Thank you from us. And me!' she concluded, throwing her hands to her head and letting out a scream of giddiness.Earlier on Thursday, just three days before the awards show, Barrymore dropped out of the hosting gig in order to show her 'solidarity' for the WGA strike.\u00a0In a statement to Variety at the time, the Scream star explained, 'I have listened to the writers, and in order to truly respect them, I will pivot from hosting the MTV Movie &amp; TV Awards live in solidarity with the strike.'\u00a0'Everything we celebrate and honor about movies and television is born out of their creation. And until a solution is reached, I am choosing to wait but I\u2019ll be watching from home and hope you will join me,' Drew added.\u00a0",
        "She sent her gratitude to MTV and revealed that she will step into the hosting shoes in 2024 for the awards ceremony.\u00a0'And I can\u2019t wait to be a part of this next year, when I can truly celebrate everything that MTV has created, which is a show that allows fans to choose who the awards go to and is truly inclusive.\u200b'\u00a0After her Best Host win, social media users on Twitter couldn't help but point out the irony regarding the situation.\u00a0One wrote, 'Drew Barrymore won best host even though she bailed on hosting tonight's MTV's Movie &amp; TV Awards??? How ironic...' followed by a confused gif.\u00a0Others commented on the location of her acceptance speech: the bathroom. A twitter user penned, 'She accepted her award on the toilet which is quite fitting the way this has gone,' while another added, 'But in the bathroom?'\u00a0Fans of the star also jumped in, with one adding, 'I love Drew Barrymore and watch her show everyday. it's so light hearted, positive never negative, and has a variety of interests on it. I especially like the cooking segment. Congratulations on winning the mtv Awards! You so deserve it!'\u00a0Others weren't as enthusiastic, with a Twitter user writing, 'This is definitely rigged,' and another, 'Of course the host wins.'\u00a0",
        "Despite not hosting the show and choosing to stay home, the star still appeared in a pre-taped skit where she portrayed her character of Josie from the 1999 movie, Never Been Kissed.\u00a0",
        "During the sketch, she showed off her dance skills with choreography from Netflix's Wednesday, and also shared a kiss with Cocaine Bear.\u00a0Barrymore wasn't alone in voicing her support for Hollywood writers during her acceptance speech. Jennifer Coolidge, who won for both Comedic Genius and\u00a0Most Frightened Performance for The White Lotus, stated, 'Almost all great comedy starts with great writers.''I just think as a proud member of SAG, I stand here before you tonight side-by-side with my sisters and brothers from the WGA that are fighting right now, fighting for the rights of artists everywhere.'\u00a0She added, 'I think of the words of Shakespeare where he once said, you know, the play is the thing. Well, I don't want to put words in his mouth or anything but I think what he really meant was it's everything!'Other winners throughout the pre-recorded show included\u00a0The Last Of Us star, Pedro Pascal, who\u00a0won the honor for Best Hero to kick off the award announcements on Sunday, as the show also garnered the honors for Best Show and Best Duo for Pascal and Bella Ramsey.",
