        "Mr Welby spoke of how \u201cJesus Christ was anointed not to be served, but to serve\u201d \u2013 adding: \u201cThe weight of the task given you today, Your Majesties, is only bearable by the spirit of God.\u201dThe Archbishop also spoke of the King\u2019s priorities as monarch, including \u201cthe way we nurture and encourage the young, in the conservation of the natural world.\u201dIn his short sermon, the archbishop said: \u201cWe are here to crown a King, and we crown a King to serve.\u201cWhat is given today is for the gain of all.\u201d",
        "Mr Welby continued: \u201cThe King of Kings, Jesus Christ, was anointed not to be served, but to serve.\u201cHe creates the unchangeable law that with the privilege of power comes the duty to serve.\u201cWe see active love in our care for the most vulnerable, the way we nurture and encourage the young, in the conservation of the natural world.\u201cWe have seen those priorities in the life of duty lived by our King.\u201dThe archbishop told the congregation King Charles\u2019s \u201cunity\u201d was what \u201cbinds us together and offers societies that are strong, joyful, happy and glorious.\u201d\u201cThey bear heavy weights for us,\u201d Mr Welby said.",
        "He continued: \u201cThe weight of the task given you today, Your Majesties, is only bearable by the Spirit of God, who gives us the strength to give our lives to others.",
        "\u201cWith the anointing of the Holy Spirit, the King is given freely what no ruler can ever attain through will, or politics, or war, or tyranny: the Holy Spirit draws us to love in action.\u201cEach of us is called by God to serve. Whatever that looks like in our own lives, each of us can choose God\u2019s way today.\u201cWe can say to the King of Kings, God Himself, as does the King here today, \u2018give grace that in thy service I may find perfect freedom\u2019.\u201cIn that prayer there is promise beyond measure, joy beyond dreams, hope that endures.\u201cBy that prayer, for every King, every ruler, and, yes, for all of us, we are opened to the transforming love of God.\u201d"
