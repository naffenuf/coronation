Send your pictures and videos to pictures@mailonline.co.uk\u00a0The Duchess of Edinburgh looked elegant today as she joined her husband the Duke of Edinburgh and their children Lady Louise and James, Viscount Severn for the King's Coronation.",
        "Sophie, 58, donned a regal white Suzannah couture floor-length embroidered gown with a Jane Taylor headpiece and Royal Victorian Order Mantle as she arrived in London for the historic first Coronation of a British monarch in 70 years at Westminster Abbey.Meanwhile her daughter Lady Louise, 19, who is a university student at St Andrew's, opted for an elegant white and blue floral gown and a chic headpiece.\u00a0Prince Edward, 59, donned morning dress with a Garter Mantle over a black smart suit which he paired with a white shirt.\u00a0James, Earl of Wessex, 15, who rarely makes public appearances, looked smart in a black suit which he paired with a white shirt and a burgundy tie.\u00a0",
        "Later the family appeared on the Buckingham Palace balcony with a select group of senior royals as The Mall was swamped by tens of thousands of cheering supporters.Lady Louise and James stood beside their royal parents as they waved to gargantuan crowds before an RAF flypast, which had to be scaled back to just helicopters and the Red Arrows because of the heavy rain in London.Over the last two years, Lady Louise has taken on an increasingly public role as her parents Prince Edward and Sophie have been bumped up the royal food chain following the disgrace of Prince Andrew and the departure of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.\u00a0",
        "She was front and centre in the Platinum Jubilee celebrations, joined her parents at the Commonwealth Games and made her successful TV debut in a documentary about her beloved grandfather the Duke of Edinburgh.Indeed she has become such a well-known face that she is recognised by customers of the garden centre where she has been working for \u00a36.63 per hour since finishing her A-levels in June last year.\u00a0\u00a0Sophie and Prince Edward wanted to give their daughter and son a 'normal' childhood with school friends and extra-curricular activities.And so Lady Louise was largely kept out of the limelight throughout her childhood, with her first major royal outing coming at the age of nine when she was a bridesmaid at the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's wedding in 2011.Meanwhile she took on a larger role in the events mourning the late Queen last Autumn, appearing emotional yet poised.\u00a0James, who is still only 15, is seen at public events more rarely.\u00a0",
        "Both Sophie and Lady Louise joined members of the Royal Family for\u00a0a dinner at Mayfair club Oswald's last night.Mike and Zara Tindall were out until 2am. Prince Harry flew in from Los Angeles yesterday for his 24-hour trip. It emerged last night he has been relegated to the third row in the Abbey with other non-working royals.",
        "The monarch had been heir since the age of three, and is now ready to finally embrace his day of destiny with the woman he loves by his side. VIP guests queued for a mile from the Abbey from 6am to get one of the prime 2,300 seats inside.Charles will be crowned in a Christian ceremony that dates back for 1,000 years on a day dripping with glorious displays of pageantry. It will also shine a spotlight on Britain\u2019s place on the world stage.And on the streets of London today, including on a packed Mall, there is huge excitement among tens of thousands who have been camped out for days so they can see the extraordinary event unfold. More than 100million will watch on TV around the globe.Approaching two million people - from all corners of the UK, Commonwealth and the world - are flowing into Central London, despite rain being forecast. Trains into the capital were packed this morning, with soldiers taking part in the ceremony seen flowing into mainline stations.Guests of the King started arriving at the Abbey from 7am - four hours before the ceremony. Some 100 heads of state are in London, with representatives from 203 countries due to attend.The longest-serving heir to the throne in British history will today be crowned at Westminster Abbey in a ceremony that is steeped in the majesty of his illustrious forebears \u2013 but also embraces and emphasises the proud diversity of modern-day Britain.",
        "\u2018There will be all the pomp and ceremony you could dream of, but as little of the \u201cthem and us\u201d as possible,\u2019 one senior royal aide said last night.Crowned alongside the King, 74, was his wife of 18 years \u2013 and his love for much, much longer.The once unthinkable has become a reality, and from today the former Camilla Parker Bowles will be known as Queen Camilla as she is anointed and has Queen Mary\u2019s Crown placed upon her head.Yesterday the 75-year-old Queen Consort made only a brief public appearance as she attended a final rehearsal at the Abbey with her husband in the morning. She chose not to attend any of the other public engagements by his side, preferring to \u2018pace herself\u2019 and also ensure \u2018the day was about her husband\u2019, sources said.\u2018She loves him unconditionally and always wants him to shine,\u2019 a friend said.Last night the couple retired to enjoy a private dinner at their London home, Clarence House.\u2018The calm before the storm \u2013 perhaps metaphorically as well as literally\u2019, a friend said with a nod to the dismal weather forecast, something the new King and Queen\u2019s celebrations have in common with the late Queen\u2019s Coronation in 1953."
