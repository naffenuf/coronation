        "The neighbour of actor Stephen Tompkinson has told a court she saw him slap and punch a drunk man in the head after asking him to move away from his home in the early hours of the morning.",
        "The 57-year-old DCI Banks star is on trial at Newcastle Crown Court accused of inflicting grievous bodily harm on Karl Poole on May 30 2021.Jurors have heard Mr Poole and his friend Andrew Hall had been drinking since around midnight and had gone to the beach to watch the sunrise before walking back past Tompkinson\u2019s home in Whitley Bay, North Tyneside.Tompkinson went outside to confront the two men for making noise outside his home and called the police asking for them to be moved on, the court has heard.On Thursday, Tompkinson\u2019s neighbour, Caroline Davidson, said she was woken by \u201chysterical laughter\u201d and looked out of her bedroom window to see two men lying on the floor.",
        "She told the court the men appeared \u201cvery drunk\u201d, were \u201cwobbling\u201d from side-to-side and one of them (Mr Poole) was just wearing boxer shorts.Mrs Davidson said she went back to bed but got up again when she heard a voice with a \u201cdifferent tone\u201d.The court heard she knew Tompkinson as the resident of the house across the road but had not spoken to him since he moved in two or three years previously.Mrs Davidson said Tompkinson \u201cwas using hand movements to ask them to move away\u201d and at one point \u201cpulled his fist back\u201d but put it down \u201cmore or less straight away\u201d before walking back towards his house while apparently making a phone call.",
        "She told the court the two men then got up with some difficulty, put their arms around each other and \u201cstarted to try and walk off\u201d when her neighbour came out again.\u201cThe two males started to turn. You could see maybe something was being said.\u201cThe next thing I knew the neighbour had stepped forward and he had slapped one of the gentlemen, the one without the top on, with his right hand and then punched him on the head with his left hand.\u201dAsked by prosecutor Michael Bunch if there was anything that \u201cprecipitated that action\u201d, Mrs Davidson said: \u201cNo.\u201d",
        "She said she was \u201c100% sure\u201d that the neighbour had moved towards the two men.Mrs Davidson told the court Mr Poole \u201cstumbled backwards and fell\u201d.\u201cHe just went straight back and his head hit the ground. He just, he didn\u2019t move.\u201cHe didn\u2019t even put his hands out to stop himself, he just hit the ground.\u201dMrs Davidson said Tompkinson came out of his house when the police arrived and spoke to two officers.She said he then placed a bottle of Jagermeister at the feet of the man lying on the floor.Jurors have previously heard Tompkinson told police he had taken a bottle from the two men.",
        "Asked if the two men made any aggressive actions towards her neighbour at any point, Mrs Davidson said: \u201cNo.\u201dCross-examining Mrs Davidson, Nicholas Lumley KC, defending Tompkinson, said: \u201cI\u2019m going to suggest what you saw was a reaching out, a push to the face, not a slap to the face.\u201dMrs Davidson replied: \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201dMr Lumley also said Tompkinson had his phone in his hand throughout the incident after calling the police and \u201cthere is no way he could punch with his left hand and slap with his right\u201d.Also giving evidence on Thursday, Mr Hall said he heard a \u201ccracking\u201d when Mr Poole\u2019s head hit the floor.He told the court he \u201cheard the hit of flesh\u201d and saw his friend fall to the ground, but in cross-examination by Mr Lumley said he only heard Mr Poole\u2019s head hit the floor and did not hear the sound of the impact that caused him to fall.Asked what Tompkinson did after Mr Poole was on the ground, Mr Hall said: \u201cI think he had his phone out but it was clear he wasn\u2019t ringing for help.\u201cLater on, I don\u2019t know the timescale, he showed a bit of humanity and a bit of remorse in my view, it must have sunk in what happened, but it didn\u2019t initially.",
        "\u201cI believe he was on his haunches with his hands on his head.\u201dJurors have heard Tompkinson told police he pushed Mr Poole away in self-defence after the two had come towards him.In a transcript from Tompkinson\u2019s police interview read in court, the defendant said: \u201cNo, I really can\u2019t afford to in my job\u201d when asked whether he had hit either of the two men.He told officers he could not have thrown a punch with his left hand because he was holding his phone, and that he had put his hand out to stop them.\u201cThey were coming towards me aggressively and my front door was open,\u201d he said.Tompkinson denies the charge and the trial continues."
