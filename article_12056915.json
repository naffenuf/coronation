        "Hugh Bonneville has hailed the King\u2019s coronation as an \u201cextraordinary\u201d event, but thinks the challenge for the future of the monarchy will be to allow the next generation to define what it means to them.",
        "The Downton Abbey and Paddington star, 59, will be hosting the star-studded Coronation Concert in the grounds of Windsor Castle on Sunday evening which will feature performances by Take That, Katy Perry and Lionel Richie.The King and Queen and other members of the royal family will join around 20,000 members of the public at the event to continue the celebrations after their crowning at Westminster Abbey on Saturday.",
        "Reflecting on his thoughts surrounding the royal family ahead of the concert, he told the PA news agency: \u201cI think each generation will need to make its own definition of what monarchy means.\u201cAnd I think that is the challenge for the future. In our ever-changing world, where does the monarchy stand? What does it mean?\u201cI mean, for my generation, and for my parents\u2019 generation, it was the glue that bound our nations together, and that glue will need to shift and evolve in order to keep the strength that it\u2019s had in the past.\u201dBonneville said he thought the coronation service was \u201cextraordinary\u201d and admitted that he found the moment the King swapped his \u201crobes of status and honour\u201d for a simple white shirt for the private anointing as \u201cparticularly touching\u201d.He added: \u201cIt\u2019s a crazy old service, it\u2019s strange to think how it\u2019s accreted over the years, over the centuries to what it is today and it obviously will have a new meaning, a different meaning for our generation, the generation that witnessed it with the late majesty.",
        "\u201cI found it moving and an extraordinary change-marker in the sand for our culture and for our generation.\u201d",
        "The actor added that he feels the concert this evening will be a \u201cmagical\u201d way to continue the festivities.The show in Windsor will also see performances by DJ Pete Tong, Paloma Faith, Olly Murs, veteran rock guitarist Steve Winwood, and Nicole Scherzinger of The Pussycat Dolls.Ahead of the event, BBC Radio 1 DJ Tong revealed Charles specifically requested Ibiza classics songs as part of his coronation concert.He told PA: \u201cHe wanted Ibiza classics, that was very specific.\u201cAnd then they asked us to suggest a couple of songs so we suggested three or four, and he came back with one of them and that\u2019s the one that\u2019s starting the show, so they very much had an involvement in what they wanted us to perform.\u201dUS singer Scherzinger said she felt like a Disney princess when she was in rehearsals for her rendition of Reflection, which was written and produced for Disney\u2019s 1998 animated film Mulan.\u201cNow that I\u2019m here, it just feels really surreal. Being on the ground and having Windsor Castle as your backdrop is the dream,\u201d she added.",

        "Also on the night, choirmaster Gareth Malone will conduct the 300-strong Coronation Choir, which he hopes will be his moment to redeem himself after he suffered a major technical issue when he performed in front of the King during a Royal Variety Performance.He recalled: \u201cI performed at the Royal Variety Performance in front of the then-Prince Charles and my backing track went completely wrong and so the whole thing fell apart and it was the worst ever performance I\u2019ve ever had in my whole career.\u201cFor years I wouldn\u2019t use any technology and I\u2019m hoping that I\u2019m going to lay that ghost to rest this very night.\u201dClassical acts including Andrea Bocelli, Welsh bass-baritone Sir Bryn Terfel and Chinese pianist Lang Lang are also on the bill.Lang told PA it was a \u201ctremendous honour\u201d to be on the bill with \u201cmany great artists from different parts of the world to celebrate music and love for music\u201d.Reflecting on how the coronation was viewed in China, he added: \u201cIt\u2019s a big country and people have different opinions but I think from what I see from the media, it\u2019s basically quite positive from the media.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pictures from it and they talk about it a lot because of the music so I would say overall it was a positive feedback.\u201d",
        "Hollywood star Tom Cruise, Dynasty actress Dame Joan Collins, adventurer Bear Grylls, singer Sir Tom Jones and former Strictly Come Dancing professional Oti Mabuse will also make an appearance via video.The series of pre-recorded sketches will reveal little-known facts about the monarch and will also include moments from beloved literary character Winnie the Pooh \u2013 seemingly echoing the famous moment Paddington Bear drank tea with the Queen during her Platinum Jubilee celebrations.Nigerian singer Tiwa Savage and winner of The Piano TV talent show, 13-year-old Lucy, will also perform.Meanwhile, fashion designer Stella McCartney will deliver a spoken word performance with a conservation theme which will reflect her and the King\u2019s \u201cshared passion for environmental sustainability\u201d, the BBC has said.Her performance will be part of a broader nature-themed section of the concert which will also include a rendition of a 1980s hit by classical-soul composer Alexis Ffrench and London-based singer-songwriter Zak Abel alongside a house orchestra, band and choir.Bollywood star Sonam Kapoor will also deliver a spoken-word performance.",
