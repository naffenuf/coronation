He\u00b4s adjusting on the fly, which is what you like from a young kid. He\u00b4s shown good discipline up there. He\u00b4s mature beyond his years far as the offensive part.\"Marcus Semien and Travis Jankowski cut the deficit to 4-3 with RBI singles in the fifth off Zac Gallen, who entered the game with a 28-inning scoreless streak, the longest in the big leagues.\"It just goes to show you how good he was when he\u00b4s shutting teams down night after night or outing after outing because the big leagues has some good hitters, guys that can do the things we saw the Rangers do today,\" Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo said.Scott McGough (0-3) relieved to start the sixth and allowed a two-out single to Jonah Heim.
