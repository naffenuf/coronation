        "A senior Labour MP has avoided discussing whether the party would go into coalition with the Liberal Democrats if it falls short of a majority at the next general election, saying \u201cWe\u2019re not even entertaining that prospect\u201d.",
        "Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey has explicitly rejected any coalition with the Tories under Rishi Sunak, but avoided ruling out a coalition deal with Labour, stressing his party\u2019s focus is \u201cgetting rid of Conservative MPs\u201d.It follows analysis of England\u2019s local election results, which showed Labour could fall short of a majority in the House of Commons at the next election.Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting, challenged on the Sunday political shows, appeared to repeatedly avoid ruling out a deal with the Liberal Democrats. We\u2019re just not in that ballpark of talking about coalition governments  Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting  Asked on Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge On Sunday whether Labour would be prepared to go into coalition with the Lib Dems, Mr Streeting said: \u201cWe\u2019re not even entertaining that prospect \u2026 I just don\u2019t think that is the scenario that we are going to be in after the next general election.\u201dHe also told Sky: \u201cI think for the next general election Labour feels confident but not complacent.",
        "\u201cI think those results do point to enormous progress made under Keir Starmer\u2019s leadership. He\u2019s changed the Labour Party, now he\u2019s got a hearing to be able to change the country, but there\u2019s more to do.\u201dAsked on BBC\u2019s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg programme about the prospect of a coalition with the Liberal Democrats, Mr Streeting said: \u201cWe\u2019re just not in that ballpark of talking about coalition governments.\u201d",
        "He also told the programme: \u201cWe think we can win a majority \u2013 people wouldn\u2019t have said that after the last general election \u2013 that\u2019s what we\u2019re working towards, that\u2019s what we\u2019re fighting for, and I think people can go confidently to the polls at the next general election knowing that a Labour government is possible and within our grasp.\u201dHe said a Liberal Democrat \u201crecovery\u201d in areas which moved away from that party to the Conservatives in 2015 \u201cisn\u2019t somehow a risk to a Labour majority, it is a path to a Labour majority\u201d.Put to him that the local election results do not show that Labour can be confident of a majority at the next general election, Mr Streeting said: \u201cThursday night\u2019s local election results were exactly that \u2013 local election results, not a prediction of the next general election.\u201dHe insisted there is more to come from Labour in key policy areas such as education and health. The focus is on getting rid of Conservative MPs  Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey  Sir Ed said the Liberal Democrats\u2019 list of target seats at the next general election will now \u201calmost certainly\u201d be longer.Speaking to BBC\u2019s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg programme, and asked if he would consider a coalition with the Tories under Mr Sunak, he said: \u201cNo. I\u2019ve spent all my life fighting the Conservatives.\u201d",
        "He said he \u201cfought them every day\u201d previously in coalition under David Cameron, adding: \u201cWhen I became leader of the party I made it very clear that my job was to get the Conservatives out of government.\u201dAsked about the prospect of a coalition with Labour, Sir Ed said: \u201cThat is a hypothetical question because we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen after the next\u00a0election.\u201dPut to him that he is ruling out working with the Conservatives but not Labour, he said: \u201cThe focus is on getting rid of Conservative MPs. I make no apology for that.\u201dCulture Secretary Lucy Frazer told Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge On Sunday programme: \u201cLabour did well, I accept that. But if it wants to get a majority at the next election, it needed to do better.\u201d"
