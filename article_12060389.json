        "Artificial Intelligence could take much of the \u201cheavy lifting\u201d out of teaching, by marking and making lesson plans, the Education Secretary has said.",
        "Gillian Keegan spoke about the \u201ctransformative change\u201d AI could bring to education at the opening of the Education World Forum in London. We have a lot more thinking and learning to do as we understand the potential here.  Gillian Keegan  In her opening address to the forum of education experts and global leaders, she said: \u201cAI could have the power to transform a teacher\u2019s day-to-day work.\u201cFor example, it can take much of the heavy lifting out of compiling lesson plans and marking.\u201cThis would enable teachers to do the one thing that AI cannot and that\u2019s teach, up close and personal at the front of the classroom.\u201dShe likened artificial intelligence to technological innovations of the past, such as calculators and Google, and said people must learn about it and apply it in the same way to maximise positive student outcomes.",
        "Ms Keegan suggested AI could be used to \u201cradically reduce the amount of time teachers spend marking\u201d, or \u201cas an assistive technology to improve access to education\u201d.While she praised the number of schools and universities already using AI, she concluded: \u201cWe have a lot more thinking and learning to do as we understand the potential here.\u201cI\u2019m committed to working hand-in-hand with expert educators \u2026 as we do that thinking.\u201d",
        "The Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) called the Government\u2019s approach to education technology \u201cpiecemeal and lacklustre\u201d.ASCL general secretary Geoff Barton said: \u201cArtificial intelligence and other digital technologies may well have the potential to help in the classroom in the future, but the Government\u2019s approach to education technology thus far has been piecemeal and lacklustre and it will need to develop a strategy to turn this into reality.\u201cMore importantly, ministers must address the immediate problem of the severe teacher recruitment and retention crisis that schools and colleges are experiencing, and which is caused by real-terms pay cuts and workload pressures driven by the Government\u2019s underfunding of the education system.\u201d"
