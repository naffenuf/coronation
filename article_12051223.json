        "The local election results suggest that the SNP could hold the balance of power at the next general election, the party\u2019s Westminster leader has said.",
        "The SNP\u2019s Stephen Flynn said Friday\u2019s results, which have seen Labour seize key battlegrounds at the expense of Rishi Sunak\u2019s Tories, could suggest that Scotland could be in a position to \u201cpull the strings\u201d of a minority government after the next general election.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has pointed to Friday\u2019s success as a sign that his party is heading towards a majority at the next general election, even if polling experts have been more hesitant in making such predictions.",
        "Mr Flynn said: \u201cIt\u2019s increasingly clear that the SNP can hold the balance of power after the next general election \u2013 putting Scotland in prime position to pull the strings of a minority UK government.\u201cVoting SNP is the best way to beat the Tories in Scotland \u2013 and every vote for the SNP will be crucial to ensure Scotland wields real power and influence.\u201dHis comments come after a disastrous few weeks for First Minister Humza Yousaf\u2019s SNP, which has been embroiled in controversy since the resignation of Nicola Sturgeon.Labour is hoping to capitalise on the difficult period for Scotland\u2019s dominant political party, with gains in Scotland potentially helping to ease Labour\u2019s path to Downing Street at the next nationwide poll.Mr Flynn, who has turned up his attacks on Labour in recent weeks, said: \u201cWith the pro-Brexit Labour Party lurching to the right, and becoming indistinguishable from the Tories, the SNP will make certain that real change happens.",
        "\u201cThe SNP would ensure the power to determine Scotland\u2019s future is transferred to Edinburgh, that the cost-of-living crisis becomes the main priority of Westminster and that relations with Europe are rebuilt and renewed.\u201dThere were no local elections in Scotland, but the results in England are being pored over ahead of the next general election \u2013 likely to come in 2024."
