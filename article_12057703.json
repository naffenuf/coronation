        "Italy's\u00a0Jonathan Milan sprinted to victory on stage two of the Giro d'Italia\u00a0Mark Cavendish missed out due to a crash which cost Tao Geoghegan Hart timeBelgium's\u00a0Remco Evenepoel stayed safe to retain the general classification leadHome hero Jonathan Milan won stage two of the Giro d\u2019Italia in a reduced sprint after a late crash ruled out Mark Cavendish and cost Tao Geoghegan Hart valuable time in the general classification.",
        "This flat stage would have been one of the ones circled by Cavendish as he seeks his first win for Astana-Qazaqstan, but the Manxman hit the deck after a collision just under two-and-half miles from the line that cost several riders.Chief among them was 2020 Giro winner Geoghegan Hart, with the Londoner held up to lose 19 seconds and fall from fourth to eighth overall, now 59 seconds behind leader Remco Evenepoel.Amid the chaos, Milan, 22, won comfortably from David Dekker on the seafront in San Salvo, taking his first Grand Tour stage win and doing it in his home race at the first attempt. Evenepoel stayed safe in the pink jersey and retained his 22-second lead but Geoghegan Hart is now four seconds behind Ineos Grenadiers team-mate Geraint Thomas, the Welshman managing to stay clear of the trouble.So much focus had been on a tight roundabout just before the final straight, but before that even came into view several riders went down on a narrow section of road.",
        "Pascal Ackermann appeared to be pushed to his right and into the path of the Trek-Segafredo lead-out train with inevitable results.Cavendish was behind the initial incident but was then struck from behind as riders struggled to slow, although his team was quick to say he was unhurt.",
        "Evenepoel was pointed in his remarks on the stage-defining incident, saying: \u2018I think I actually saw it happen and we know who we can blame for the crash but that\u2019s racing.\u2018It wasn\u2019t a nice move but luckily we stayed out of trouble.\u2019While the recriminations began, Milan celebrated a breakthrough moment. \u2018I am without words,\u2019 the Italian said.\u2018I cannot believe it. My first Giro, the second stage. I could never imagine that today a victory was coming.\u2019Although Cavendish was out of the running, there was one Brit in the top 10 as Jake Stewart sprinted to take ninth place for Groupama-FDJ. The race continues today with a 132-mile stage from Vasto to Melfi."
