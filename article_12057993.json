        "She previously said she did not originally plan to sell the\u00a0stone brick 1880s-era house, but the couple decided to let it go after finding another renovation project.'We've found this other project that we want to take on and it feels right,' she told Realestate.com.au.Bartholomew, who shares daughter Molly, two, and, one-year-old son Tom, with husband Neil, a former executive at Twitter Australia, said moving out had been hard for her.'I get emotional when I think about everything that's happened in this house. It's where we started our family. It's such a special place that we love so much,' she said."
