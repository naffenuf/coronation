        "Manchester united lost 1-0 to West Ham in the Premier League on SundayAaron Wan-Bissaka and Tomas Soucek were involved in a nasty collisionThe pair received treatment for seven minutes but were allowed to continue\u00a0\u00a0Fans watching West Ham's clash with Manchester United were far from impressed as Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Tomas Soucek were both allowed to stay on the pitch after a nasty clash of heads.",
        "The incident, which came as two men competed for a cross, saw both left lying on the floor in serious pain.The stoppage lasted seven minutes with a stretcher being brought out on a buggy as a precaution.It seemed as if neither player would be continuing in the game considering the new concussion laws.",
        "However, they were both allowed to stay on and complete the match.And viewers quickly took to social media to criticise what they deemed to be irresponsible.\u00a0'Absolute farce Soucek and Wan Bissaka are still on the pitch here,' wrote one.'It\u2019s time football brought in HIA,' wrote another. 'Wan Bissaka and Soucek shouldn\u2019t be back on the pitch until they\u2019ve been properly assessed.'",
        "Another posted: 'If we are serious on concussion protocols, there is no way Aaron Wan-Bissaka &amp; Tomas Soucek are allowed to keep playing. That was a 7 minute stoppage, they should've both been taken off.'West Ham won the game thanks to a terrible mistake from David De Gea, who allowed\u00a0Said Benrahma's tame strike to slip past his hand.The result all but secures top flight survival for the hammers, who are now seven points above the drop.\u00a0"
