        "After what seems like forever, summer is finally on its way.",
        "We're saying goodbye to cold, dreary days (we hope) and welcoming long days of sunny blue skies.And the arrival of summer means holidays are on the horizon, so whether you're jetting off to far flung beaches or planning a UK staycation, now is the time to get the whole family's holiday looks sorted.Think easy-to-pack, easy-to-style clothes you'll ALL love.And if you need inspiration, look no further than Very where you'll find incredible fashion for the whole family from in-house labels V by Very and Everyday, as well as big name brands like\u00a0River Island, Mango, Levi\u2019s, Crocs and Birkenstock.And they're all in one place, so shopping for everyone couldn't be easier.\u00a0We asked two super stylish mums to create their perfect holiday wardrobes and asked them for their tips on kitting out the kids, what to pack and how to make a family holiday go with a swing.'These looks are all great for a UK staycation, so I\u2019ll definitely be taking them to Cornwall!'Sharlene Fleary, 37, AKA @curlylittledreams, is mum to Hector, 6, Hugo, 3 and Neve, 8 months, and is looking forward to when they can all escape to Cornwall for a staycation this summer.",
        "'We went to Cornwall last year and that was really lovely,' Sharlene says. 'The boys are desperate to go back, it was really beautiful.'",
        "And this busy mum of three says a great family holiday is all in the planning, knowing what\u2019s in the surrounding area, staying somewhere child-friendly and taking childcare into account. 'That\u2019s really important for us - to get some couple time alongside family stuff.'And when it comes to packing for the whole family, organisation is key.'For Cornwall we need to bring rainwear, sun wear, beachwear,' Sharlene says. 'I have a little tick list so I can tick off what we need to bring, otherwise I just end up forgetting things.\u00a0I\u2019d like to say you should pack in advance but I never do\u2026 I\u2019m always last minute.'",
        "Sharlene is also in charge of clothes shopping for the kids and likes to mix classic pieces with more fashionable items.\u00a0'There is always a budget and I\u2019m thinking about longevity, especially for the boys,' she says. 'I like to buy some staple items they can wear over and over again for birthdays and special occasions. But every once in a while I do like to pick out trendy items that make them look a little bit extra cool.\u00a0'I always like to colour co-ordinate and match the children. I find it a lot easier and it makes cute photos!'For me I like dresses with pockets and I like to dress for my shape. That\u2019s why I love wrap dresses as they\u2019re flattering. They accentuate my waist.",
        "'So I love this pink wrap dress from Very which I chose for the colour. It\u2019s lovely and bright and I like how the sleeves balloon. Plus, the length was perfect.'For Neve I'll be packing this\u00a0denim dress and pink top. Denim is easy to wash and doesn\u2019t crease as much, so one less thing to iron.'",
        "And for Hector and Hugo, Sharlene is a fan of these shorts and top sets from the Mini V by Very range.\u00a0'I love these matching yellow shirts with white shorts,' she says. 'They look cute and classic. I like them to be dressed quite smartly, but the shorts are casual so they can still run around.\u00a0'These looks are all great for a UK staycation, so I\u2019ll definitely be taking them to Cornwall.'\u00a0Now get the look...Love Sharlene's staycation style?\u00a0Shop it all at very.co.uk now!

        "Ola and Darcy\u00a0Pelovangu are parents to four gorgeous kids, Mayah, 7, Micah-Remi, 5,\u00a0Dream, 3 and\u00a0Nubia, 1 (@thepelofamily). They love all-inclusive getaways in the sun where they can be sure the whole family is catered for.",
        "Where will you be jetting off to this summer?'We're going abroad this year and we're trying to decide where. We like resorts with kids' clubs, where we can be confident they're looked after while we have our own time.\u00a0'Anyone with kids knows you need a holiday to get over a holiday. The number one thing is catering to everyone. I never used to be organised until we started travelling with kids, but now I have a key note presentation with every outfit planned for everyone!'\u00a0",
        "What are your tips for travelling with children?'Keep the kids busy on the plane! Colouring pencils, a game. Kids are more entertained when you get involved with them.\u00a0'Always look at the kids' club at the resort, if there is one, and always book activities before the holiday. We made a mistake once and when we got there, everything was booked up already. Also,\u00a0understand you will have parenting issues while you're abroad. Just because you're away it doesn't mean it'll be serene, so don\u2019t have too high expectations. It\u2019s just important to make the memories.'",
        "What's important to you when you're shopping for clothes for the family?'Everything needs to embody practicality. The quality has to be amazing so I can use things from last year. I pride myself on being able to say it\u2019s from last year.'I like certain colours \u2013 earthy tones, browns, greens, salmons and soft blues \u2013 so I can mix and match with different outfits. Just a bit of casual coordination.'How would you describe your style?'My style prioritises comfort over everything. I love to shop for timeless pieces and that's why I love earthy tones as they never go out of style.'Darcy likes fitted, round collared shirts. He wears linen, which is good for the skin. Darcy likes understated, glam, elegance. He's not into labels, but he's definitely into quality.'What are the holiday essentials you always pack?",
        "'We all have little 'change of clothes' bags I keep in our hand luggage in case of accidents, and\u00a0I always travel with a first aid kit.\u00a0'I love those towels that kids put over their outfits. That\u2019s saved us so much! They don\u2019t get cold when they come out of the sea. I\u2019d love an adult one!\u00a0'Sun hats and sun cream are essential. I love a floaty beach dress and a bit of white. On holiday everything seems fresher. For the kids I love\u00a0linen two pieces. You can't go wrong with that for the boys. Linen is our go-to for everyone because it\u2019s cooler.'Tell us about the clothes you'll be taking on holiday from Very...",
        "'I went for a Hawaiian hibiscus style for Darcy, Mayah, Micah-Remi and Dream, but I don\u2019t want us all to be in the same things, so I pick out colours in the print. So,\u00a0I picked a white dress as there\u2019s white in the print. I like the wrap around waist on the broderie anglaise dress. A lot of mums are conscious of that area, so it makes me feel confident. The neckline is great too.'My favourite outfit was the yellow dress. It has a nice neckline and is roomy enough so there's still space to eat, which is a big decider for me as I love to eat when I go away. It's the same for the kids. They have room to play and move in their yellow and orange dresses. Comfort and practicality are key.'",
        "Why is Very your go-to for summer holiday clothing?'The selection of brands on very.co.uk is the main appeal for me. And I\u00a0love the sets of five T-shirts. Then you buy two pairs of shorts, and you have almost a week of outfits in just two buys. V by Very is good value for money and great for children.\u00a0'We've got great choices now for our holiday.
