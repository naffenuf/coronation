Although for the best sunset, head to the west \u2013 Mt. Moritz to be specific.Eat at places like The Fish Pot at Vendors Market or The Jupa in Carriacou \u2013 the quality of food on the island is grade A from the smallest shop by the side of the road, to the five-star restaurant. And drink Rivers Rum \u2013 it's why the Grenadian people are so strong!So drop what you are doing, book a flight with British Airways, and come witness Grenada!Akeem Abraham, Grenadian musician",
