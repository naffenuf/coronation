        "WASHINGTON, May 2 (Reuters) - The United States plans to announce as soon as Wednesday a new military aid package for Ukraine worth $300 million that will for the first time include a short-range air-launched rocket taken from U.S. excess stocks.",
        "The Hydra 70 rockets are a 2.75 inch diameter air-launched, unguided rocket made by General Dynamics. The rockets are typically loaded in to a circular, 19 tube rocket launcher pod that is attached beneath the wing of aircraft or helicopters.The package also includes more 155 millimeter Howitzer cannons but does not say if they are self-propelled or towed by a truck.
