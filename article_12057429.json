        "Paris Saint-Germain avoided distraction from noise surrounding Lionel MessiClub has been rocked this week by the Argentine's unsanctioned Saudi tripKylian Mbappe and Vitinha's goals took Christophe Galtier's side to brink of title\u00a0Paris Saint-Germain shut out the noise surrounding the club with an assured 3-1 victory at Troyes, a win that takes them to the brink of the title.",
        "The club was thrown into fresh crisis this week when it emerged Lionel Messi had been suspended for two weeks after he made an unsanctioned trip to Saudi Arabia, a visit that was performed in his role as an ambassador for the country.It remains to be seen whether he ever plays for the club again, though such questions did not appear to bother his team-mates on Sunday evening.Kylian Mbappe scored in the eighth minute after a Vitinha cross was deflected onto the top of the bar by defender Erik Palmer Brown before the striker waited for it to drop and headed home.Vitinha made it 2-0 before the hour when he headed a lofted pass by Marco Verratti that keeper Gauthier Gallon parried back against the Portuguese with the ball rebounding into the net.",
        "Xavier Chavalerin pulled a goal back for Troyes in the 83rd but Ruiz restored PSG's two-goal advantage three minutes later with a fine left-foot strike into the top corner after the ball rebounded to him when Mbappe's close-range shot was saved.'We know it was a difficult match against a well-organised team and we did well, creating chances and goals,' said Vitinha. 'It was very important to win today...''A bit closer...' Mbappe posted on Instagram"
