He's never shown any sign of an understanding of our history or of a concern with it  Historian David Starkey  But he went on to attack Mr Sunak\u2019s education and career in the United States, which he said made him a member of a \u201chighly technical elite\u201d.He said: \u201cEven when he became \u2013 I think it was on the point of becoming Prime Minister \u2013 he had an American green card. His wife is non dom.\u201dDr Starkey said that at Oxford, Mr Sunak read \u201cthat terrible degree called PPE (Philosophy, Politics and Economics), which has destroyed our governing class\u201d, going on to California\u2019s Stanford business school.He added: \u201cSo we have a Prime Minister who is astonishingly intelligent, but I think sees things as an MBA (Master of Business Administration).\u201cWhat he campaigns about is money. He thinks in terms of spreadsheets.\u201d",

All his speeches are technical.\u201dThe historian batted away accusations of racism that arose from his original comment.\u201cWhat I was trying to emphasise was nothing to do with race,\u201d he said, claiming that had been wrongly inferred by the \u201cusual witch hunters who hate GB News and hate me in particular\u201d.Dr Starkey sparked the row when, in his Thursday appearance on the TV channel, he said Mr Sunak \u2013 the first non-white occupant of No 10 \u2013 was \u201ca man of immense talent, of extraordinary skill, but really not fully grounded in our culture\u201d.Asked to explain his comment, made as he criticised the Prime Minister for being \u201cinvisible\u201d in preparations for the coronation, he said: \u201cIn terms of religion.\u201dTory MPs including former party chairman Nadhim Zahawi and Caroline Nokes reportedly slammed the remarks as \u201cill-informed\u201d, and \u201cvile and racist\u201d.Dr Starkey has been embroiled in controversy in the past, including for saying in an interview that slavery was not genocide because there are \u201cso many damn blacks\u201d."
