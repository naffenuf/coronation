        "A day of searching has found no sign of a fisherman swept from rocks on the NSW coast.",
        "The man, believed to be in his 70s, was fishing with a friend near Blowhole Point in Kiama on Tuesday evening when he fell into the water.Marine Rescue NSW's Stuart Massey said it was unfortunate the man was not wearing a life jacket or other safety gear.\"If he was wearing that jacket he would probably be home having a cup of tea, despite being cold and wet,\" he told AAP on Wednesday.Rescuers will set back out again on Thursday and retrace the more than 40 nautical miles searched off the Illawarra coast on Wednesday,\"Our crews have a really tough job, they're out there in tough conditions,\" Mr Massey said.\"We have highly skilled volunteers and it's what they're trained to do.\"Marine Rescue NSW is working with water police to find any sign of the fisherman.A two-hour search on Tuesday night, shortly after the man was reported missing, was called off due to poor conditions."
