        "Prince Louis was excited as he jumped around at a volunteering day in Slough\u00a0READ MORE: For all the latest Royal news, pictures and videos click herePrince Louis once again stole the show this Bank holiday weekend as he joined his parents and siblings for a day of volunteering for The Big Help Out - and shared a playful moment with his sister Princess Charlotte, who kept an eye on him during the historic Coronation ceremony on Saturday.",
        "The young royal, five, may have been absent at yesterday's concert - but this morning showed off his cheeky personality as he took part in his first public engagement.As the family rolled their sleeves up to renovate a building in Slough, fan-favourite Louis was full of energy as he bounced about while the Prince and Princess of Wales later toasted marshmallows and chatted to people from the area.The little Prince absolutely devoured the sweet treat and was also seen chomping down on a S'more, made with biscuits and some chocolate.Louis then staggered about jokingly and rolled his head in delight, knocking into his sister Princess Charlotte, eight, who - seemingly used to her little brother's antics - simply smiled as she bit into her own sweet snack.\u00a0",
        "Before they left it was time to toast some marshmallows, Louis excitedly high-giving a group of other children as he did.\u00a0The children were each given a wooden stick with sweet treats on it and held them over a brazier.'Is that getting warm,' asked Kate, as Louis put his hand over his face as the smoke started to sting his eyes.'I like mine just like this!' he declared and started pulling the marshmallows off enthusiastically with his teeth.He held his arm up in air and tried to grab another one off his mother, popping his spent stick in the fire.",
        "His eyes lit up when he was handed a 'S'more' - a marshmallow with chocolate sandwiched been two biscuits.'What do you say?' encouraged Kate.'You've made his day!' Interjected William. 'We won't hear a peep out of him.'",
        "Will and Kate's decision to bring their young family was kept secret until they arrived in order minimise any fuss for the youngsters who are being slowly introduced to the idea of public engagements.The family were also insistent that the children get 'properly stuck in' and lend a hand - which they certainly did.The children set to work straight away with Charlotte and Louis helping to paint a planter and George joining his father with some drilling.The two youngest children knelt down, grabbing brushes dripping with white masonry paint, obvious to the fact that they were getting it on their hair and bare legs.One volunteer asked Louis: 'You might want to be a painter when you grow up?'",
        "'No a fighter pilot,' he responded.'Just like your father and grandfather!' the lady replied.The children worked away uncomplainingly while the Princess of Wales hovered over them, letting them do their worst. 'Well done Louis!' She said.When Kate tried to interject and advise Charlotte on what to do, her daughter said firmly but politely: 'I don't like this.'",
        "'Good job,' she told Louis, 'well done.'Charlotte told her brother: 'You've got paint in your hair! Louis, look at me! Look at me! ''Yes Louis, look at Charlotte,' the adult volunteer advised.Louis seemed supremely unbothered.'You've got to wipe it,' Charlotte gently admonished him.The family was visiting the\u00a0Upton Scouts Hut in Slough, west of London, as they joined in to help volunteers on the project.Kate, 41, was seen pushing a wheelbarrow while her youngest son shoveled in sand. He then took control, steering it expertly as his mother supported its weight.Charlotte was seen delightedly running to help prepare a new path while George, a future king himself, was spotted learning how to use a power drill. All three young Wales' had a crack at archery too but while George did get the controls of the digger, Charlotte appears to have declined.",
        "Daniel Madigan, from the 1st Chippenham scout troop, said the George, Louis and Charlotte joined in all the outdoor activities that had been laid on.'I saw them toasting some marshmallows. They seemed to enjoy it,' he said.'Louis also helped move from sand into a wheelbarrow.'The couple and their three children were out and about again to mark the third day of the King's Coronation, and Charles III's life of service.",
        "The Princess of Wales has been Joint President of the Scouts since 2020 and the royals joined volunteers in resetting a path, digging a new soakaway, sanding and revarnishing the front door, adding planters to the front of the building and adding a mural to create a lasting legacy of the Big Help Out's work.\u00a0William and Kate,who were casually dressed, wore scarfs from the 3rd Upton Scout Group as they mingled with scouts and leaders taking part in The Big Help event \u2013 one of thousands across the country to mark the end of the coronation.",
        "Mr Madigan said the Big Help Out event was to make improvements to the scout hut, including building a ramp at the rear of the scout hut to make it more accessible.As the Princess of Wales left she stopped to talk to local resident Donna Robinson who was standing by a barricade with her seven year old daughter Ciara.The Princess, casually dressed in a blue top and dark coloured trousers, held on to Louis's hand as she stopped to say hello and asked Donna how old her daughter was.Donna said: 'She asked what year Ciara was and was lovely.'Other senior royals including the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh, the Princess Royal and the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester, are also getting involved in volunteering today.",
        "Princess Anne and her husband, Vice Admiral Sir Timothy Lawrence, are at a civic service recognising local volunteers at Gloucester Cathedral, which will be followed by a special reception for invited volunteers and charity representatives from across Gloucestershire.\u00a0",
        "Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh, as a patron of Guide Dogs, is attending a puppy training class at the Guide Dogs Training Centre in Reading with her husband, Prince Edward.There are over 8million opportunities to get involved today, with more than 52,000 events happening across the nation.The 3rd Upton Scouts Hut was built in 1982 and is used by a variety of community groups in the area, including the local mosque, a senior citizens contact group for members of the Asian community and the Scout group themselves.\u00a0The building is also used by 'Slough All Nations,' a group with heritage spanning across St. Kitts &amp; Nevis, and which provides recreation and leisure activities to improve health and wellbeing and promote community cohesion. \u00a0Among other planned events, the Royal Parks is holding a drop-in session in Green Park in central London, close to Buckingham Palace, where volunteers can plant wild flowers in the same spot where the public laid floral tributes to the late Queen.The Duke of Gloucester, the late Queen's first cousin, and his wife Birgitte are meeting young volunteers at a Coronation party at St Mark's Coptic Orthodox Church in Kensington, west London.",
        "Meanwhile, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is helping out at a lunch club, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer will hit the phones with the NHS Volunteer Responders scheme, Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford is volunteering at a local charity shop, and Scotland's First Minister Humza Yousaf is volunteering at a local community larder.Mr Sunak said: 'The Big Help Out is not only a chance for everyone to come together to mark His Majesty's Coronation, it's also a reminder of how each and every one of us can help make a change for the better.'It is this community spirit that binds us and makes us stronger as a country, and I hope that as part of the legacy of this historic moment of national unity, people will be inspired for years to volunteer, to help out and to make a difference to others around them.'"
