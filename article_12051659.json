        "Royal mega-fans braving intermittent downpours to camp out ahead of the coronation said the rainy British weather will not put a dampener on their \u201conce-in-a-lifetime opportunity\u201d.",
        "Poncho-clad royalists with umbrellas at the ready, many wearing crowns and clothes adorned with Union flags, bustled about the tents lining The Mall in central London amid occasional heavy showers on Friday.The smiling, albeit soggy, campers arrived early to bag prime viewing spots for when the coronation procession leaves Buckingham Palace for Westminster Abbey on Saturday.Among them was Trisha Hollis, 71, from Hull, who had pitched up on Friday.",
        "She told the PA news agency: \u201cIt\u2019s history and I think at my age it\u2019s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\u201cI think I was two when the Queen was crowned but obviously I have no recollection of that.\u201cI admire the royal family, I\u2019m glad we have them. I think the Queen did a sterling job.\u201dOn Friday\u2019s rainy showers, she added: \u201cWhat will be will be.\u201cIt\u2019s 24 hours in my life. I will get dry and warm again sometime so I\u2019ll grin and bear it.\u201cIf you come back to me at 2am I might not be saying it with such a smile.\u201cMaybe we\u2019ll have a nice day tomorrow but it did rain for the Queen in \u201953.\u201dA married mother of four joked that her children think she is \u201cmad\u201d and having a \u201cmidlife crisis\u201d because she is camping out for the crowning.",
        "Kim Bilson, 54, from Poole, Dorset, told PA: \u201cIt\u2019s too big of an occasion to miss really, don\u2019t want to look back at it and think, why didn\u2019t we do it.\u201cIt\u2019s a lovely atmosphere here, meeting people from all over the place.\u201dShe arrived at about 6pm on Thursday and said it was a \u201ccold\u201d and \u201cnoisy\u201d experience camping out overnight.But she added: \u201cPeople are just so friendly.\u201cIt\u2019s just Britain at its best, everybody nattering to everybody.\u201cThere\u2019s no stiff upper lip, everybody\u2019s here for the same reason and it\u2019s just really nice.\u201dOn what her children make of her escapades, she added: \u201cThey think I\u2019m mad. They think we\u2019re mad. In fact, midlife crisis came up at one point.\u201dRichard Turner, 54, of Southend-on-Sea, Essex, is forgoing a tent and sleeping on a camping chair.",
        "Wearing a Union flag hoodie, the single father of one, who arrived at midnight on Friday, said: \u201cI\u2019m just sleeping in a chair. I don\u2019t want to take up too much space so I thought I would just bring a chair, I\u2019ve got an umbrella if it rains.\u201cI love this kind of thing, I love history, I love the pageantry, I\u2019m a fan of the royal family, it\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever known since I was born.",
        "\u201cI\u2019ve been doing these royal events since I was nine, my first one was 1977, the Silver Jubilee.\u201cThis is a big event, I wouldn\u2019t want to miss this.\u201cThis is one of those events where you have to be here in person and see it for real because you wouldn\u2019t get the impact on the telly.\u201cYou\u2019re not going to get another one of these for some years now, this is the last big royal event.\u201cAll those that can be married are married, all those who can pass on have passed on.\u201dSarah Exner, 29, a nurse who lives in Texas, flew over a few days early for a holiday so she could join the campers.",
        "She said: \u201cIt\u2019s always been really fascinating, the monarchy.\u201cWe\u2019ve always had a wonderful time keeping up with the events.\u201cIt\u2019s just a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be able to come out here for the coronation.\u201cThey don\u2019t happen very often and we don\u2019t have as much of the pomp and circumstance in the United States and it\u2019s lovely to come out here and see all the traditions.\u201dOn how she expects to feel tomorrow, Ms Exner said: \u201cI think it will be very exciting, very interesting to see. We have already had a lot of fun.\u201d"
