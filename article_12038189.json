        "Over the decades I\u2019ve had the privilege of talking about spectacular souvenirs from the 1953 coronation.\u00a0Here are some more gems from the time, including remarkable objects that played a part in the event itself.\u00a0Luckily, given so much was produced for the occasion, there\u2019s hope for the rest of us that we may have an undiscovered treasure in our homes.THE PERSONAL FORM AND ORDER OF SERVICE USED BY THE QUEEN",

        "There were plenty of mass-produced coronation souvenirs available in June 1953. One of my favourites is this mug, decorated with a pattern by artist Eric Ravilious, who had produced designs for Wedgwood for the cancelled coronation of Edward VIII and the subsequent coronation of King George VI in 1937.\u00a0Wedgwood updated Ravilious\u2019s 1937 design for the Queen\u2019s coronation mug, using stylish pink and yellow.
