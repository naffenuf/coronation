        "On Tuesday, Daily Mail Australia revealed that Zonfrillo had\u00a0secretly battled bowel cancer for years.A source said he kept his health problems from most friends and colleagues, usually receiving treatment when the Network Ten cooking program was not filming.It is not suggested\u00a0Zonfrillo died of cancer, only that he had told very close friends he was suffering from the disease.It comes as the Ten Network announced that MasterChef's 15th season will premiere on Sunday, with the full support of the chef's grieving family.\u00a0The network and sponsors had been determined to respect the will of Zonfrillo's grieving wife Lauren.",
        "A close friend and neighbour of Zonfrillo has since revealed that the celebrity chef sometimes opened up to him about his 'demons' over a glass of scotch.Stuart Ayer told Daily Mail Australia he and his wife struck up a close relationship with the TV star's family during the three years they were next-door neighbours.'I was a bit choked up when I found out he died, and I still am,' Mr Ayer said.'We used to sit and talk about our demons - he was open about his demons in his book, but I have my own and we'd chat about them over a scotch.'I found it really helpful - he was a great guy.'",
        "Zonfrillo opened up about his battle with heroin addiction, his rise to the top of the culinary world, and about his relationship struggles in his 2021 memoir, Last Shot.In the book, he spoke candidly about how he began working for celebrated British chef Marco Pierre White at 17, when he was homeless and addicted to heroin.When his boss realised he was sleeping in the restaurant, he found him accommodation and lent him cash.Zonfrillo moved to Australia aged 20 in 1996 and gained work at Forty One in Sydney's central business district. He was\u00a0using cocaine, pills, LSD and cannabis, but kept a raging heroin addiction hidden from everyone.",
        "He went back to the UK when his visa ran out in 1997. Two years later he took his last shot of heroin in the toilets at Heathrow airport before returning Down Under, and used the experience as inspiration for his book title.Arriving in Sydney, he stayed at his then girlfriend Kelly's parents' house as he went cold turkey, a process he describes as 'horrific'.'For 10 days I was vomiting and screaming and s**ting all over the place before the fever finally broke,' he wrote.",
        "'I've always said, \"If it wasn't for food, I would've died\".'\u00a0Speaking with Daily Mail Australia on Wednesday, Mr Ayer said they kept each other company during Melbourne's lengthy Covid lockdowns, and would pop their heads over the fence to ask how the other was going.'Then after lockdown, Jock would say \"I've made some food, do you want to come round?\" and we'd have dinner or something.'Speaking about Zonfrillo's relationship with his wife, Mr Ayer said 'they were a really solid couple'.'The kids were the light of his life,' he said. 'They're great kids and it's such a tragedy.'Mr Ayer gushed about the Zonfrillo family and talked about how they were 'wonderful people' and good neighbours.The Zonfrillo's moved out of their two-storey $3000-a-week rental and moved to Italy a few weeks ago.\u00a0",
        "A source told Daily Mail Australia the chef 'wanted to live in Italy for a while', but his wife was initially reluctant.'It was something he was planning, then she changed her mind,' the source said. 'She wanted change.'Zonfrillo was just settling into their new life when he had to return to Melbourne to undertake promotional work for the new season of MasterChef, which was supposed to start airing on Monday evening.Zonfrillo was also in the early stages of planning a new restaurant and had started working on a cookbook prior to his shock death.\u00a0His wife and kids stayed in Rome and were expecting Zonfrillo to re-join them once his work with Channel 10 this week was complete.\u00a0The family are understood to have returned to Melbourne on Tuesday night."
