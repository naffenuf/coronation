        "The 80-year-old actress, who starred opposite Sir Roger Moore in 1974\u2019s The Man With The Golden Gun as Mary Goodnight, was a close friend of Charles\u2019s aunt Princess Margaret, who died in 2002.Ekland, who was speaking around the 50th anniversary of horror film The Wicker Man, recalled her first meeting with Charles, who was a big fan of the BBC radio comedy show The Goon Show, which starred her then-husband Peter Sellers.The Swedish actress told the PA news agency: \u201cI met Prince Charles first when he was 16.\u201cThere\u2019s a picture of me and him and Peter Sellers because he was a great Goon fan and he came out and had lunch and hung out with them.\u201cAnd then in the 90s when I lived in London all the time, I was part of the Prince\u2019s Trust, so I met Prince Charles many times in that capacity.",

        "She told PA: \u201cI love the fact that I can see it, but I don\u2019t have to be there and be pushed and shoved. I like that.\u201cI don\u2019t have a friendship with the royal family any more.\u201dThe Wicker Man 50th Anniversary restoration will be in cinemas on June 21."
