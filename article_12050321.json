        " David Moyes\u2019 future beyond this campaign is under some doubt with the club already contemplating potential successors.Moyes\u2019 position has been\u00a0under scrutiny for much of 2023\u00a0following a difficult season that leaves the club just four points from the relegation zone.His contract expires in the summer and there is a sense that both parties could part ways ahead of the 2023-24 campaign.And The Sun claim Fonseca is keeping a close eye on the situation.",
        "The Portuguese has a contract which expires in 2024 but is said to be open to an early exit should Lille fail to provide him with assurances over transfer funds.Graham Potter and Brendan Rodgers are also in the running to replace Moyes with both men currently out of a job.Fonseca managed\u00a0Shakhtar Donetsk and Roma before taking charge of Lille last summer.His side currently sit fifth in Ligue 1, just two points behind fourth-placed Monaco.",
        "Fonseca has been credited for his attacking style of play, a style which saw Tottenham take a close look at him in 2021.\u00a0Much will depend on how the Hammers close out the season with the club also gearing up for a Europa Conference League semi-final.\u00a0"
