        "PARIS, May 4 (Reuters) - France's dominant services sector grew less than initially estimated in April, a monthly survey showed on Thursday, as business confidence dipped slightly while inflation remained a concern.The HCOB France final purchasing managers index (PMI) for April for the services sector, compiled by S&amp;amp;P Global, rose to 54.6 points, well below a flash reading of 56.3 points though up from 53.9 in March.Any figure above 50 points indicates an expansion in activity.The April final composite PMI, which includes services and manufacturing, fell to 52.4 points from 52.7 in March, reflecting ongoing weakness in manufacturing.April's flash composite PMI figure was 53.8 points.The HCOB France PMI survey stated there had been a \"mild deterioration in service sector business confidence during April\", and that input and output price PMIs remained at historically high levels.\"This is unpleasant news as inflation in France is increasingly driven by core inflation, which is dominated by services. While this has fallen recently, the PMIs suggest that core inflation could remain stubborn for the time being,\" said Hamburg Commercial Bank AG economist Norman Liebke.
