        "Sir Ephraim Mirvis, Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth, posted a message to Charles on social media on Tuesday, ahead of Saturday\u2019s ceremony in central London.In the video, the Chief Rabbi gestures towards a framed copy of a \u201cprayer for the Royal family\u201d which hangs in his office.He explains its history and says it serves as a reminder that the \u201cJewish community have always prayed for the monarch\u201d, before sending Charles well-wishes ahead of the Westminster Abbey coronation.Sir Ephraim was installed in his role in September 2013 during a ceremony attended by Charles when he was prince of Wales, the first time a member of the royal family was present.He is only the 11th chief rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth since the office was introduced in 1704.\u201cHere in my office hangs a most wonderful prayer, it\u2019s the prayer for the Royal family,\u201d Sir Ephraim says in the clip.\u201cThis is the oldest one which actually stands in any one of our synagogues.\u201cThe original is in the Plymouth Synagogue, dating to 1762.\u201cPrayer for the Royal family.\u201cAnd actually, on this one, every time there was a new sovereign they changed the name and I\u2019ve got this copy here as a reminder of the extent to which we the Jewish community have always prayed for the monarch.",
        "\u201cAnd in that context we send our very best wishes and blessings to King Charles III on the occasion of his coronation.\u201dFor the first time representatives from the nation\u2019s faith communities will play an active role in the coronation of a monarch, and they will be visible from the initial moments until the end of the ceremony.At the end of the coronation, the King will receive a greeting in unison from leaders and representatives from Jewish, Hindu, Sikh, Muslim and Buddhist communities, with Sir Ephraim set to be among this group.They will tell the newly crowned King: \u201cYour Majesty, as neighbours in faith, we acknowledge the value of public service.\u201cWe unite with people of all faiths and beliefs in thanksgiving, and in service with you for the common good.\u201dCharles will acknowledges the greeting."
