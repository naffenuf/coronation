        "Ashes hopeful Olly Stone is set to undergo a scan to determine the severity of a hamstring problem.",
        "Stone, who has had a luckless run with injuries, pulled up late on Saturday during an over and shuffled off the field in Nottinghamshire\u2019s LV= Insurance County Championship clash against Lancashire.Despite being in obvious discomfort, Stone hobbled to the crease at Trent Bridge on Sunday as last man and kept out the last four legal deliveries of the Division One match to help his side salvage a draw.Attention will now turn to his aggravation and it is understood he will be examined more thoroughly once any inflammation in the area has subsided, most likely within the next couple of days.Stone\u2019s ability to generate speeds upwards of 90mph make him an attractive option for England\u2019s six Tests between the start of June and mid-July \u2013 one against Ireland and five versus Australia.England captain Ben Stokes has indicated he wants eight fit seamers to call upon, all of whom can be rotated to share the burden, with Stone, Jofra Archer and Mark Wood providing the express pace options.Stone made his England comeback last winter after recovering from a fourth stress fracture in his back \u2013 he had an operation to reinforce his lower spine with two metal screws \u2013 and a broken finger.",
        "He played in four ODIs and a T20, was an unused squad member during England\u2019s Test tour of New Zealand in February and, on the eve of the county season, spoke of his determination to put his injury woes behind him.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s been encouraging with how much cricket I\u2019ve had under my belt this winter and come through it,\u201d said Stone, who played the last of his three Tests in June 2021.\u201cI\u2019m feeling fit and strong and just raring to get stuck in now. I\u2019ve looked at things in the past, injuries got in the way and I\u2019ve been quite disappointed so I try not to look too far ahead.\u201cBut everyone knows how big a summer it is and I\u2019d be lying if I said it wasn\u2019t on the radar.\u201d"
