You couldn't find closer work mates and confidantes.'They are devastated. 'Broken' is the word described to me. They are trying to process this news.'Zonfrillo's MasterChef colleagues did not seem to know he died until shortly before the news broke on Monday afternoon, as the publicity machine for the new season was in motion as late as 11.30am when Leong posted a countdown clock for the premiere on her Instagram account.For confidential support call the Lifeline 24-hour crisis support on 13 11 14."
