        "Jim Archibald told the judge in her murder trial that Ian Pawlowski should give no further testimony. 'He dated Melani Boudreaux for a couple of weeks, got married in Vegas and then contacted law enforcement a week later and, at the direction of law enforcement, he became a snitch,' Archibald said.Prosecutor Lindsey Blake objected to Archibald calling Pawlowski a snitch. She said he was trying to help the police locate Vallow's missing kids JJ, seven, and Tylee, 16.Vallow, 49, and her husband Chad Daybell, 54, are accused of killing and burying the kids in his backyard in Rexburg, Idaho, in September, 2019. They are accused of murdering his wife Tammy a month later. The pair married in Hawaii two weeks later.Pawlowski told the Ada County Courthouse in Boise that he met Vallow and Daybell a handful of times after he started dating the cult mom's niece in late November, 2019.",
        "Pawlowski went to Rexburg Police on December 5 because he was worried about the safety of his children and his ex-wife after hearing the views espoused by Vallow. They asked him to wear a wire and he agreed.He made a total of nine recordings of conversations between his new wife, Vallow and Daybell over the course of two weeks. Nobody was aware he was making the recordings except for him and law enforcement.",
        "The judge denied the defense's request to play a recording which Pawlowski made of his wife Melani speaking on the phone to Vallow and Daybell in early December, saying that it was unclear who was speaking and therefore, hearsay.\u00a0Pawlowski told jurors that in those recordings neither Vallow nor Daybell confessed to a crime - but that there 'was an arrogant, flippant attitude toward law enforcement.' At the time cops had started inquiring about Vallow's missing children and Tammy Daybell's death had been reclassified as suspicious.'They asked me to listen and observe and report back. They also asked me to make recordings for them,' Pawlowski told the court.He met Vallow briefly right after he began dating Melani in late November 2019. The pair married in Las Vegas ten days after their first date.Pawlowski said he spoke with Vallow less than a dozen times and that in those interactions she expressed bizarre religious beliefs.'She discussed beliefs about possession, about locking Satan away \u2013 those are the two that stand out the most,' he told jurors.Pawlowski said he tried maintaining an open mind at first because as a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints you can learn new things 'through one of the Lord's servants.'",
        "However, when Vallow explained there were rankings for people who were 'light and dark' he decided he did not agree with what she was saying. Vallow and Daybell claimed that her children and his wife Tammy were 'dark' - possessed by evil spirits - before their deaths.Pawlowski told the court: 'The point where it really turned for me was the morning after I married Melani. Melani dumped everything on me and shared everything.'We were staying at the Bellagio in Las Vegas and my two children were with me. The next morning I got up and my daughter was gone. She was gone for about 15 minutes. She was nowhere. Finally, I hear some giggling from behind the curtain.'After hearing everything I had from the night before, that was terrifying. At that point I decided I wasn't going to give this a chance, I'm not going to mess with it.'Pawlowski testified abiout conversations he overheard Melani having with Vallow and Daybell, including about 'casting.'",
        "'There were references to it during phone calls that I heard. My understanding is with casting you are trying to expel a possession or \"bug\" type of possession where something would crawl into your ear or brain. During casting you would pray to force the possession out of the body,' Pawlowski told the court.",
        "He also said he believed that Vallow had manipulated and taken advantage of Melani.'In the two weeks I was meeting with them, there were a lot of things that came about that Lori was exactly being truthful with Melani. She was telling her that Brandon is dark, that law enforcement officers Melani should have been cooperating with were dark beings when in reality these officers were trying to find two missing children and what happened with the shooting of Brandon Boudreaux,' he told the court.On October 2, 2019, Melani's ex-husband Boudreaux was shot at while driving home from the gym in Gilbert Arizona. Vallow's brother Alex Cox is suspected of carrying out the attempted hit.Prosecutors say that the shooting was part of a conspiracy advanced by Vallow - that if Boudreaux died, she would have had access to his money through her niece, Melani.Cox shot dead Vallow's former husband Charles Vallow in July, 2019. She moved to Rexburg to be near to Daybell days later. The pair had been carrying out an affair.Vallow has been charged over Charles' death in Arizona and is expected to face trial at a later date over his alleged murder.\u00a0Her killer brother\u00a0Cox, who was a member of her deranged doomsday cult, died of natural causes in December, 2019.\u00a0",
        "Vallow's children were missing for almost a year before their corpses were found buried in Daybell's yard on June 9, 2020.During the opening, prosecutor Lindsey Blake described how charred remains were all that was left of Tylee.She told jurors: 'You will hear it explained as a mass of bone and tissue. That's what was left of this beautiful young woman.'Tylee's DNA was later found on a pickaxe and shovel in a shed on the property.JJ's body was wrapped in trash bags and duct tape - the tape binding his arms in front of him and wrapping around his head. He had been suffocated inside a plastic bag.The two children and Daybell's previous wife Tammy were all killed because they stood in the way of the couple's relationship, the State says.\u00a0'Remember, the defendant will remove any obstacle in her way to get what she wants, and she wanted Chad Daybell,' Blake told jurors.",
        "'The defendant used money, power and sex to get what she wanted.'Jurors have heard from friends and relatives of Vallow that she and Daybell believed the children were 'dark' and referred to them as 'zombies' before they disappeared.'The common theme was the body has to be destroyed,' Blake said. 'The defendant and Chad used their self-proclaimed religious teachings to justify their actions to others \u2014 their actions from affair to murder.'",
        "Prosecutors say the couple planned to use life insurance money from Tammy's death, and that Vallow kept collecting and spending the children's social security and benefits after they died.The trial opened on April 10 and the State is still laying out its case.\u00a0Vallow denies two counts\u00a0of first-degree murder and three counts of conspiracy in the deaths of her two children and Tammy Daybell.She further denies grand theft for allegedly collecting government benefits on behalf of her children after they were killed.Daybell is being tried separately.",
