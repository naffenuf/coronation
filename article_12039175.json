        "Its top attackers all squandered good opportunities to break the deadlock, with Ansu Fati, Pedri, Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 and Robert Lewandowski failing to find the target despite clear chances.It took a veteran defender to come through and move the Catalan club a step closer to its first Spanish league title in four years.Jordi Alba scored an 85th-minute winner not long after coming off the bench to give Barcelona a hard-fought 1-0 win against 10-man Osasuna on Tuesday.The victory gave Barcelona a 14-point lead over second-place Real Madrid, which later lost 2-0 at Real Sociedad. The combination of results means that the Catalan club can clinch the title as early as next weekend.\"It was a very big step for us, but we suffered too much, wasted too many clear chances to score,\" Barcelona coach Xavi said.",
        "Both Madrid and Osasuna are focused on Saturday\u00b4s Copa del Rey final between the clubs in Seville.

        "It was Barcelona's third straight win at home. It had gone through a tough stretch recently but victories against Atletico Madrid and Real Betis at Camp Nou helped it maintain its comfortable lead at the top.Osasuna played a man down from the 26th after central defender Jorge Herrando, who was making his first-division debut, was shown a straight red card for pushing Pedri from behind to stop a breakaway. The ensuing free kick taken by Raphinha glanced off the crossbar.Pedri had nearly scored from close range before the red card, but Barcelona wasn't able to create many more significant chances in the first half after going a man up, finishing with no attempts on target going into the break.Frenkie de Jong, Fati, Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 and Lewandowski all came close in the second half before the 34-year-old Alba finally broke the deadlock with a low shot with the outside of his left foot after a set up by De Jong inside the area. Alba had entered the match less than 10 minutes earlier.It was the 25th clean sheet in the league for Barcelona, which had lost playmaker Gavi in the 36th with an apparent muscle injury. He was replaced by Fati.Osasuna had won three of its last five league matches but was coming off a home loss against Sociedad.",
