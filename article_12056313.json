        "Police got the \u201cbalance right\u201d between allowing protest and enjoyment of the King\u2019s coronation, the Culture Secretary has said.",
        "Lucy Frazer defended the Metropolitan Police after the force was heavily criticised by MPs and human rights groups over dozens of arrests.The chief executive of anti-monarchy group Republic, who was among 52 people arrested on Saturday, was released after nearly 16 hours in police custody.Graham Smith tweeted that there was \u201cno longer a right to peaceful protest in the UK\u201d.",
        "Ms Frazer denied that officers had gone too far.The Cabinet minister told Sky News\u2019 Sophy Ridge On Sunday programme: \u201cWhat they have to do is balance the right to protest, which is important in a democracy. At the same time there\u2019s the right of all those other people to enjoy what was a fabulous day.",
        "\u201cI think, overall, they managed to get that balance right.\u201dShe said it was right of the police to take into account the context of the event, as it took place on the world stage with hundreds of foreign dignitaries attending and had national security implications.The Met confirmed 52 people were arrested for affray, public order offences, breach of the peace and conspiracy to cause a public nuisance around the coronation.Under the controversial new Public Order Act, protesters who have an object with the intention of using it to \u201clock on\u201d are liable to a fine, with those who block roads facing 12 months in prison.",
        " What worries is me is that the Conservative government have now increased these sort of wide-ranging powers ... what they haven\u2019t done is enshrined the sort of legal responsibility and the duty on the police to actually facilitate peaceful protest  Daisy Cooper, Lib Dems  Asked whether she trusted the police to use the new laws, Ms Frazer said: \u201cYes, I do trust them to use those new powers.\u201cI have huge confidence in the police.\u201cI think it\u2019s absolutely right that they have the powers that they need in order to ensure that people can go to go on their day-to-day lives at the same time as respecting people\u2019s rights to protest.\u201dThe new laws were intended to \u201credress the balance\u201d after a recent change in demonstrators\u2019 tactics, she said.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen in this country a rise in protests and the way people are protesting that is interfering with the rights of people to go around their daily life.\u201dMetropolitan Police Commander Karen Findlay acknowledged concerns about the arrest of protesters but defended Scotland Yard\u2019s actions, saying: \u201cOur duty is to do so in a proportionate manner in line with relevant legislation.\u201dThe Met said it received information that protesters were \u201cdetermined to disrupt\u201d the coronation \u2013 including defacing public monuments with paint, breaching barriers and disrupting official movements.",
        "Campaigners said the protests were \u201cpeaceful\u201d, describing the arrests as \u201ca dangerous precedent for us as a democratic nation\u201d.The Liberal Democrats\u2019 deputy leader said she had \u201cconcerns\u201d the police may not have got the balance right in handling protests.\u201cSome of that information is unfolding. But, on the face of it, I do have concerns,\u201d Daisy Cooper told Ridge.\u201cWhat worries is me is that the Conservative government have now increased these sort of wide-ranging powers \u2026 what they haven\u2019t done is enshrined the sort of legal responsibility and the duty on the police to actually facilitate peaceful protest.\u201dLabour frontbencher Wes Streeting said it was important for police to provide \u201caccountability\u201d over concerns raised about how demonstrators were treated.\u201cWhere concerns have been raised, whether that\u2019s by Republic, the campaign for an elected head of state, or people more generally just concerned about they\u2019ve read in the papers or seen on the telly, it\u2019s important that the police provide that accountability,\u201d the shadow health secretary told the same programme."
