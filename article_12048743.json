        "CHICAGO (AP) - Carlos Correa drove in a run during Minnesota\u00b4s five-run 12th inning, and he and Byron Buxton homered to lift the Twins over the Chicago White Sox 7-3 Thursday and avoid a three-game sweep.",
        "The AL Central-leading Twins had lost three of four. Correa spurred Minnesota to victory hours after downplaying remarks from Chicago reliever Keynan Middleton, who called Correa \"a cheater\" in reference to his time with the Houston Astros.Eloy Jim\u00e9nez homered for the White Sox, who ended a three-game winning streak.\"These games are good because a lot of people have to do a lot of good things in order to win,\" Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said. \"Everyone kept their cool and kept playing well and lasted long enough for the late-inning explosion.\"Chicago shortstop Elvis Andrus misplayed Jose Miranda\u00b4s leadoff grounder in the 12th and Trevor Larnach scooted in from second to give Minnesota the lead for good. Nick Gordon and Correa added RBIs later in the inning and Jorge Polanco broke the game open with a two-run double.Emilio Pag\u00e1n (2-0) worked the 11th to get the win.",
        "Alex Colom\u00e9 (0-1), the fifth Chicago reliever, took the loss. The White Sox had just one hit in the final six innings while stranding nine runners.\"It\u00b4s probably the best we\u00b4ve been since I\u00b4ve been here,\" Pag\u00e1n said of his bullpen mates, who issued five intentional walks in the final five innings while allowing just one hit.\"It\u00b4s cool for (Baldelli) to show confidence in us to get into the zone when we need to.\"",
        "Jim\u00e9nez singled in the first to extend his hitting streak to seven games, then smacked Pablo L\u00f3pez\u00b4s pitch into the left-center stands in the third to give the White Sox a 2-0 lead.Correa hit a solo shot in the sixth off Lucas Giolito before Buxton added an eighth-inning blast off Reynaldo L\u00f3pez to tie it.\"We were 1 for 16 with runners in scoring position,\" Chicago manager Pedro Grifol said. \"We had some good hitters at the plate. ... Just one of those days, man.\"Middleton struck out Correa to end Wednesday\u00b4s Chicago victory, then called him a cheater. Middleton played his first five seasons in the AL West, overlapping with Houston's tainted 2017 title run.\"I\u00b4ve heard worse,\" Correa told reporters before Thursday\u00b4s series finale. \"I\u00b4m just glad he\u00b4s doing good and he\u00b4s playing good and he can take care of his family.Correa\u00b4s shot ended Giolito\u00b4s run of 13 straight outs. The Chicago starter allowed just two hits and struck out seven with three walks in the first seven.Pablo L\u00f3pez allowed six hits and a walk while striking out eight in the first seven innings.SHORT ORDERChicago\u00b4s Billy Hamilton, a pinch-runner after Andrew Vaughn walked to open the eighth, stole second and got to third on Jhoan Duran\u00b4s wild pitch with no outs. He stayed there, however, after Duran induced three grounders to short to escape.",
        "TRAINER\u00b4S ROOMChicago: INF Jake Burger was placed on the 10-day injured list before the game with a strained left oblique. Burger, who\u00b4s hit a team-best seven homers so far, left after the fourth inning Wednesday night with soreness. The club recalled Lenyn Sosa from Triple-A Charlotte and started him at second base.UP NEXTThe Twins travel to Cleveland on Friday, where they\u00b4ll send RHP Bailey Ober (1-0, 1.59) against likely starter RHP Peyton Battenfield (0-2, 4.67).The White Sox begin a three-game series the same night in Cincinnati, where Lance Lynn (0-4, 7.16) faces fellow RHP Hunter Greene (0-1, 2.89).___More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"
