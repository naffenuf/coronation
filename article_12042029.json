        "Sir Keir Starmer said millions will pay the price of Tory \u201crecklessness\u201d in higher mortgages and a shortage of homes as the party leaders clashed in their final exchanges before local elections in England on Thursday.",
        "The Labour leader put the focus on the fallout of Liz Truss\u2019s short stint as prime minister and higher mortgage rates, while claiming Conservative councillors \u201csimply don\u2019t want to build the houses local people need\u201d.But Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Labour represented \u201chigher council tax, higher crime, and a litany of broken promises\u201d, accused them of failing to build enough homes in London and Wales, and said last time Labour were in power\u00a0\u201cthere was no money left for the country\u201d.The latter remark was a reference to Labour former minister Liam Byrne, who in 2010, as outgoing chief secretary to the Treasury, left a note for his Liberal Democrat successor which read: \u201cI\u2019m afraid there is no money. Kind regards \u2013 and good luck! Liam.\u201d",
        "Sir Keir responded to the reference in the Commons, saying: \u201cDebt doubled since 2010, growth down, tax up, the economy crashed. They\u2019re going to need a bigger note.\u201dBut the retort prompted laughter and heckles from the Tory benches.The Labour leader opened the final Prime Minister\u2019s Questions before local elections in some areas in England on Thursday by asking: \u201cHow many mortgage payers are paying higher rates since the Tory Party crashed the economy last autumn?\u201dMr Sunak replied: \u201cOur record on homeownership is crystal clear \u2013 because of our tax cuts, 90% of first-time buyers now don\u2019t pay any stamp duty at all.",
        "\u201cLast year, we saw the largest number of people buying their first home in 20 years.\u201cThat is a Conservative Government delivering on people\u2019s aspiration to own their own homes.\u201d By the end of this year, nearly two million homeowners counting the cost of the Tories\u2019 economic vandalism with every mortgage payment they make  Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer  Sir Keir said: \u201cThe answer that the Prime Minister avoided giving is 850,000.\u201cNearly a million people paying more on their mortgage each month because his party used their money as a casino chip.\u201dHe asked: \u201cDoes the Prime Minister know how many more people will be joining them on higher mortgage rates by the end of this year?\u201dRishi Sunak replied: \u201cWe know that our plans will deliver lower inflation and lower interest rates, but we know that his plans just mean more debt, and I quote \u2018year after year after year\u2019.\u201cThose aren\u2019t my words, that is the assessment of the former Labour shadow chancellor.\u201dSir Keir responded: \u201cBy the end of this year, nearly two million homeowners counting the cost of the Tories\u2019 economic vandalism with every mortgage payment they make. Now he (Sir Keir Starmer) wants to impose top-down housing targets, he wants to concrete over the greenbelt and ride roughshod over local communities  Prime Minister Rishi Sunak  ",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s not just those who already own their home that are counting the cost of Tory recklessness, the average deposit for a first-time buyer is going up to \u00a39,000.\u201dMr Sunak replied: \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve introduced a 95% mortgage guarantee scheme, it\u2019s why we\u2019re helping people in social housing own their own home through our first homes and our shared home ownership schemes.\u201dSir Keir said: \u201c\u00a39,000 would take four years, they think it\u2019s funny \u2026 roughly the annual bill to heat his swimming pool, but for most people, four more years of scrimping is a hammer blow to their ambitions.\u201cAnd now he\u2019s kicking them when they\u2019re down, because his decision to scrap housing targets is killing the dream of homeownership for a generation. Why doesn\u2019t he admit he got it wrong and reverse it?\u201dMr Sunak said: \u201cI promised to put local people in control of new housing and I\u2019m proud that that\u2019s what I\u2019ve delivered within six weeks of becoming Prime Minister.\u201cNow he wants to impose top-down housing targets, he wants to concrete over the greenbelt and ride roughshod over local communities. Now previously he did say, he\u2019s on record as saying, local people, local communities should have more power, more control. Now he\u2019s U-turned, just another in a long list of broken promises.\u201d",
        "Sir Keir responded: \u201cHis councillors simply don\u2019t want to build the houses local people need, so he\u2019s given them a way out.\u201dHe added: \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t he stop the excuses, stop blaming everyone else, and just build some houses instead.\u201dMr Sunak said: \u201cOur memories aren\u2019t that short. We all know what happened last time when they were in power, there was no money left for the country.\u201dHe criticised Labour\u2019s record on housebuilding, saying: \u201cIn London, the former Conservative mayor built 60,000 affordable homes in his first five years in office, how many did the current Labour mayor manage \u2013 half of that.\u201cIn Wales, we need 12,000 new homes a year, how many have Labour built in the last year? Half of that. Labour talk and the Conservatives deliver.\u201dMr Sunak said Labour stood for \u201chigher council tax, higher crime, and a litany of broken promises\u201d, adding: \u201cMeanwhile, we\u2019re getting on with delivering what we say, with lower council tax, lower crime and fewer potholes.\u201d"
