        "Pip Edwards was a walking promotion for her activewear label on Sunday when she stepped out in Sydney clad head to toe in her P.E Nation gear.",
        "The fitness entrepreneur, 43, showed off her stunning curves and trim figure in a black puffer jacket which she paired with a figure-hugging dark top and jeans.Her luscious blonde hair was hidden under a baseball cap and she added a touch of style with a designer gold chain.She also wore white P.E Nation sports socks and rocked just one accessory that was not from her own label - designer white and orange Balenciaga sneakers\u00a0valued at $1500.A light layer of makeup helped emphasise her stunning facial features and she completed her look with freshly manicured pink nails.",
        "The stunner could not wipe the smile off her face as she made her way down the leafy street to run errands.\u00a0Back in March, Pip said her main focus at the moment was taking care of herself after revealing her private health struggle.Speaking to Stellar magazine, she said her life was turned upside down almost three years ago after she was diagnosed with perimenopause.",
        "Menopause is the natural time in a woman's life where they have gone through 12 months without menstruating.The term perimenopause refers to the transition phase into menopause, and can involve symptoms like irregular menstrual cycles, hot flashes, decreased fertility and sleep issues.Pip said she's now completely focussed on her health and could not care less about recent scandals, including her ex Michael Clarke's Noosa showdown.",
        "When quizzed on whether Michael had apologised to her for dragging her into the saga, Pip simply said it wasn't 'relevant'.She also said the 'hardest thing' about the fallout was having to cope with her health struggle behind closed doors."
