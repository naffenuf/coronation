And there were people travelling from Miami and Scotland and Wales and all over.",
        "\u201cAnd it was just incredible to see the different generations there were, you know, grandparents with their little chairs out, and there were little toddlers on dads\u2019 shoulders, and everyone (with) painted faces and waving flags.\u201cSo we got to chat and engage with the public and, of course, our priority was to make sure that the ceremony and the passing of the carriages, the procession went smoothly without being interrupted.\u201dAsked about the briefing she had been given for the day, she explained: \u201cSo all ran smoothly where we were based, we worked very closely with the Met, and they were in full PPE protection.",
        "\u201cSo they had their armour and batons and handcuffs, whereas myself and the officers that were on the route itself, were in our very smart tunics. We didn\u2019t have that type of protection.\u201cSo there were two barriers, so the crowd were behind two barriers with the Met officers within the crowd, and they had armed forces, it was well covered.\u201cOur main message to us was to be smart and look smart, and to be alert and just to inform our inspectors and those officers in the crowd if we saw anything suspicious but luckily it was a fantastic atmosphere\u2026\u201d.Lancaster added that they had also been briefed about \u201csome of the dangers that could occur\u201d, including horses getting spooked and said that \u201cif someone attempted to come over the barrier, I would have most certainly intervened\u201d.",
