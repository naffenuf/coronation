        "She may not have scored an invite to the prestigious Met Gala.",
        "But\u00a0Lara Worthington still turned heads as she rocked up for the after-party at\u00a0The Box nightclub in New York City on Monday night.The 35-year-old model attended the famously riotous event with\u00a0Margaret Zhang, the Australian-born editor-in-chief of\u00a0Vogue China.Lara went braless in a semi-sheer dress with red polka dots, and completed her edgy look with knee-high platform boots.The Met Gala after-party at\u00a0The Box, a trendy windowless club on the\u00a0Lower East Side, was hosted this year by\u00a0Doja Cat and Diddy.",
        "A-listers started to arrive at about midnight, but\u00a0Diddy didn't take to the stage until 2:30am, according to\u00a0Vogue.com.The theme of this year's Met Gala was late designer Karl Lagerfeld.Lagerfeld, the designer for hire at Chanel, Fendi, Chlo\u00e9 and more, died in February 2019\u00a0after 65 years in fashion.Few designers have made the deep cultural impact he did, especially within the confines of carrying on historic heritage legacies.",
        "Lara shares three sons, Rocket, seven, Racer, six, and River, two, with her actor husband Sam Worthington.The family spent most of 2021 in Australia, after living in the U.S. for several years.However, they have since returned to America and are living in New York City.Lara has become known for her bold fashion sense ever since she reinvented herself from swimsuit model to chic socialite.",
        "She is known for wearing lots of black, and often adds a tomboy twist to her ensembles with oversized blazers, sneakers and T-shirts.In a recent interview Stellar magazine, she said she has a relaxed attitude when it comes to fashion.'I wear whatever the hell I want and I don't care!' she said.The mother of three also told The Daily Telegraph her must-haves include a 'black dress in a statement silhouette' and 'a leather dress [that] stands the test of time'.\u00a0"
