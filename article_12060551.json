        "Oli McBurnie fired the Premier League-bound Blades ahead in the 53rd minute when he headed home his 13th goal of the season before James McAtee tapped the ball into an empty net a few minutes later to double the lead.Dion Sanderson pulled one back for Blues late on but in the end it was a deserved victory for Heckingbottom\u2019s men who will follow champions Burnley back up to the big time.Heckingbottom said: \u201cI\u2019m delighted the game was good and I\u2019m pleased we won. It\u2019s important to talk about how well everyone\u2019s done all season, 28 wins, 91 points.\u201cI spoke to them (the players) before the game and usually we\u2019ll talk about the opposition, but I just wanted to thank them for this season, thank them for the last 18 months.\u201cFor the majority of us our journey started last November, and it\u2019s taken us this long to achieve what we wanted.",
        "\u201cThere\u2019s been some moments from a footballing point of view when I\u2019m on the sidelines I couldn\u2019t be prouder, they\u2019ll know what I mean. We\u2019ve played well but also with a presence that has sacred teams to death and that\u2019s been really pleasing.\u201dBlues boss John Eustace said: \u201cI think it\u2019s been an excellent season. It\u2019s been very good. We were made favourites for relegation at the start of the season so to get 53 points, the highest number of points in six years, is good.",
        "\u201cThere\u2019s lots to build on of course there is but there\u2019s been some fantastic memories throughout the season.\u201cI also said throughout the season there were going to be some really difficult moments which there were, but the way we stuck together and got through it was exceptional.\u201cTo get the most minutes for Under-18 players in Europe is an exceptional achievement in the toughest league in Europe.\u201cTo get the most minutes for Under-20s in the Championship is an exceptional achievement. To do that and stay in the league and be competitive in every game we play, I think we\u2019ve done well.\u201dBefore the game, Birmingham released a statement confirming details of a takeover which will see Tom Wagner\u2019s group assume ownership.The statement read: \u201cAfter the transfer of shares Shelby Companies Limited will own 45.64% of Birmingham City PLC and all of the St. Andrews Stadium.\u201cShelby Companies Limited is a subsidiary of Knighthead Annuity &amp; Life Assurance Company, and managed by American financier, Tom Wagner. Both SPA\u2019s are subject to approval from both the English Football League (EFL) and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.\u201cBirmingham City will remain under the control of the current Board until the relevant Owners and Directors Tests (OADT) have been approved by the EFL and after the completion of the contracts.\u201d"
