        "Jose Mourinho labelled\u00a0referee Daniele Chiffi as the 'worst' he has encountered\u00a0The Roma boss criticised the official after his side's 1-1 draw against MonzaMourinho has received three red cards this season over clashes with officialsJose Mourinho has claimed he wore a wire for his own protection during his side's match against Monza, with the Roma boss labelling referee\u00a0Daniele Chiffi as the 'worst' he has encountered.",
        "Roma suffered a blow in their pursuit of European qualification on Wednesday, after drawing 1-1 with Monza.Stephan El Shaarawy\u2019s opening goal was cancelled out by Monza's Luca Caldirola, with the\u00a0result leaving Roma outside the European places in Serie A.Mourinho was angered by the decision from referee\u00a0Chiffi to send off\u00a0Mehmet Zeki Celik\u00a0for a second bookable offence.The Portuguese coach claimed the official has 'no empathy' after sending off Celik in the fifth minute of second half stoppage time.",
        "Mourinho hit out at the referee in his post-match comments, adding that Roma were 'weak' for failing to demand that Chiffi does not officiate their matches.\u00a0\u2018This was the worst referee I have encountered in my entire career,\u2019 Mourinho told DAZN, as quoted by Football Italia.\u2018Believe me, I have dealt with many bad referees. Usually, when I talk about referees, it is because they have a direct influence on the game.\u2018In this case, I don\u2019t think that is true. But he is horrible, he makes no human connection with anyone, he has no empathy, he gives a red card to a player who slips because he is exhausted at the 96th minute.\u2018Unfortunately, this too is a sign of Roma\u2019s weakness as a club, because we do not have the strength of other clubs who can say we don\u2019t want this referee.",
        "\u2018I stopped working 20-30 minutes from the end, because I knew he would give me a red card for anything.\u2018There are clubs that say I don\u2019t want this referee and Roma either don\u2019t have this capability or the DNA or anything else.\u2018It\u2019s horrible, with the few players I have in my squad, I could not get a red card.\u2019",
        "According to\u00a0Gabriele Marcotti, Mourinho added that he had worn a wire for the match for his own 'protection', following several disputes with officials during the season.\u00a0Mourinho had been sent off by\u00a0Chiffi back in September, after coming onto the pitch to remonstrate with the official having seen his side denied a penalty in a 1-0 defeat against Atalanta.The Roma boss has received three red cards during the campaign, having also been dismissed in matches against Torino and Cremonese.The 60-year-old received a two-match touchline ban last month for the red card against\u00a0Cremonese, following an\u00a0altercation with\u00a0fourth official Marco Serra.Mourinho had threatened to take legal action following his dismissal.\u00a0Roma's draw against Monza leaves\u00a0Mourinho side seventh in Serie A, with AC Milan and Atalanta ahead only on goal difference.Roma are just two points behind fourth placed Inter Milan, who occupy the final Champions League spot.Mourinho's team also have a route to the competition through the Europa League, with the Italian side facing Bayer Leverkusen in the semi-finals."
