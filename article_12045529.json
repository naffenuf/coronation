        "There has been a 40 per cent increase in the number of puppy registrations of the pint-sized breed over the past year, according to The Kennel Club.King Charles and Queen Consort Camilla are parents to two Jack Russell Terriers, Bluebell and Beth, who they rehomed\u00a0from Battersea Dogs and Cats Home in 2017.They\u00a0are the latest canine residents of the palace since the monarch took the throne, and\u00a0may have contributed to the breed's resurgence ahead of the coronation.Bill Lambert, spokesperson for The Kennel Club, told MailOnline: 'Breeds certainly wax and wane in popularity \u2013 and there are a number of factors that can play a part, such as popular culture and high-profile ownership.",
        "Name: Jack Russell TerrierAverage height:\u00a010-15 inches (25-38 cm)Average weight:\u00a014-18 pounds (6-8 kg)Life expectancy: 13-16 years\u00a0Colouring:\u00a0White with black, brown, or tan markingsBred for: Fox hunting in England in the early 1800sCharacteristics: Tenacious, intelligent, energetic, friendly, brave, strong prey drive",
        "'Of course we urge would-be owners to spend time researching which dog best suits their lifestyle, and making sure they can take care of their various needs, such as grooming and exercise, rather than simply choosing a popular breed or based on a trend.",
        "'Jack Russell Terriers are small dogs with a big personality, known for their lively and happy character.\u00a0",
        "'They are popular family pet and will make a cheerful companion for anyone who can give them enough exercise and attention.'According to The Kennel Club,\u00a0Jack Russell Terrier ownership increased by 14 per cent between 2021 and 2022, coinciding with King Charles coming to the throne.Plus, in the first quarter of 2022, 85 Jack Russell Terrier puppies were registered with The Kennel Club, but in the same period this year there were 117 - an almost 40 per cent increase.\u00a0The Jack Russell Terrier is a small-sized breed of terrier that was developed in England in the 19th century by a clergyman named John Russell.His interest in the breed began when he spotted a little dog, named 'Trump', on the back of a milk wagon, who became the mother of the breed after Russell bought her.Trump was mostly white in colour, which Russell liked because it made her easier to spot while out hunting than brown or black dogs.She was bred with a black and tan terrier to give the characteristic colouring of the breed.\u00a0Jack Russell Terriers were originally created to hunt foxes, which was a major problem for farmers and landowners at the time.They had to be small enough to enter the dens, have the speed and stamina to cover long distances and be brave enough to come face-to-face with foxes.",
        "They were bred to be fearless and agile hunters, with the ability to flush out foxes from their dens and chase them down.",
        "The breed's popularity grew rapidly, and it soon became a favourite among hunters and farmers across England.In the late 1800s,\u00a0Jack Russell Terriers made their way to Australia with British settlers to aid the control of vermin in rural areas, but were also used for hunting.Their exposure to different types of work helped to further develop the breed's versatility and adaptability.\u00a0The first Jack Russell Terrier club was established in England in 1894, with the aim of promoting the breed and maintaining its working abilities.\u00a0But after World War II the need for hunting dogs declined, and so did the number of\u00a0Jack Russell Terriers.However, they became more prevalent in domestic settings as companion dogs, with owners drawn to their loyalty, intelligence and convenient size.A study from last year found that Jack Russell Terriers have the longest life expectancy of all UK dog breeds of 12.7 years.",
        "King Charles has a fondness for Jack Russell Terriers and has owned several throughout his life, including one named Tigga who he had for over 18 years.The pooch was given to him by Lady Salisbury and featured on many royal Christmas and birthday cards. One of his offspring, Freddy, was given to Camilla.",
        "Tigga was put down in 2002 after a long-term illness, and the King had a willow sculpture of him put up in the grounds of Highgrove House as a memorial.Alongside Tigga, in the 1990s, the monarch had another Jack Russell Terrier named Pooh. It is unclear whether they were both named after the A. A. Milne characters.\u00a0Sadly, Pooh went missing on the\u00a0Balmoral estate in 1994 while Charles and his family were on holiday, and is thought to have gotten stuck down a rabbit hole.\u00a0While a fan of the Jack Russell Terrier breed, the King has also owned a yellow Labrador called Harvey, and grew up with his mothers beloved Corgis, of which she had over 30.\u00a0The Pembroke Welsh Corgi is now one of the UK's most popular breeds according to The Kennel Club, despite being listed as 'vulnerable' in 2014.This is believed to be thanks to the Queen's passion for the dogs, and their popularity spiked ahead of the Platinum Jubilee last year.",
        "Beth and Bluebell were adopted by King Charles and Queen Consort Camilla in February 2017.Before being taken in by Battersea Cats and Dogs home, Beth had been found tied to a post, while Bluebell was found wandering around a woods with no fur.",
        "Camilla told BBC Radio 5 Live: 'Along I went to Battersea, and Beth appeared, and she had just been moved from pillar to post and dumped.\u00a0'We thought it would be nice for her to have a friend. They found [Bluebell] two or three weeks later, wandering about in woods, no hair on her, covered in sores, virtually dead.\u00a0'And they nursed her back to life and her hair grew again. She's very sweet, but a tiny bit neurotic, shall we say.\u00a0Talking about her love of dogs, she added: 'The nice thing about dogs is you can sit them down, you could have a nice long conversation, you could be cross, you could be sad and they just sit looking at you wagging their tail.'Beth and Bluebell moved into Buckingham Palace with King Charles and Queen Consort Camilla shortly after the death of Queen Elizabeth II.The late queen left behind four royal canines; two corgis, Candy and Muick, a corgi-dachshund cross - or 'dorgi' - named Sandy, and cocker spaniel Lissy.Candy, Muick and Sandy all went to live with Prince Andrew in\u00a0Royal Lodge, in Windsor Great Park, while Lissy was given to her trainer.\u00a0The Kennel Club is urging anyone thinking about taking on a Jack Russell Terrier to research the breed first and make sure they are right for them.",
        "Mr Lambert said: 'They have a lot of energy and need active exercise every day, as well as plenty of mentally-stimulating games to enjoy.'"
