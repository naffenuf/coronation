        "The 'badly decomposed' minke whale washed up on a a beach in East Lothian\u00a0East Lothian Council cordoned off the area and issued a warning\u00a0Comes following number of other recent whale deaths across the UK in months\u00a0A second whale has washed up on a beach in East Lothian in under a month.",
        "The dead whale beached on North Berwick beach on Sunday morning.East Lothian Council cordoned off the area and advised people to stay away while arrangements were made to remove the carcass.The council said in a statement on Facebook: 'Unfortunately, a badly decomposed minke whale has been washed up on North Berwick beach this morning.'A cordon will be put in place while arrangements are made to remove it and people are advised to maintain an appropriate distance and to keep dogs away.'The whale carcass was later lifted into a trailer.",
        "The incident has been reported to the Scottish Marine Animal Stranding Scheme (SMASS) which will decide if further investigation is needed.\u00a0It is the second whale to wash up on the same beach in recent weeks, with workers spending hours removing the nine-tonne carcass of a minke whale which beached on April 19.The 31ft female mammal washed ashore at West Bay Beach after it was spotted in North Berwick the day before.\u00a0Common minke whales are the smallest of all baleen whales, and although it is not unusual for several to be found in close proximity to each other in feeding grounds off the west coast of Scotland, they are happy in their own company.They typically grow up to around 35ft in length and weigh up to 20,000 pounds, or nine tonnes.",
        "They are found in oceans all over the world, prefer cooler temperatures and live on a varied diet of krill, schooling fish and larger ones too.And further north, a\u00a0dead humpback whale was found on a sand bank at Loch Fleet nature reserve in Sutherland on Friday.",
        "An expert at the Scottish Marine Animal Stranding Scheme (SMASS) - a dedicated research and reporting project for\u00a0stranded cetaceans, pinnipeds, marine turtles and large sharks in Scotland - said that initial examinations suggested the juvenile female had died after becoming tangled in creel lines.Stranded whales longer than 25ft (7.62m) are considered 'royal fish', with the Scottish Government having first claim on those found dead or stranded on the shoreline north of the border on behalf of the Crown.If it does not want to claim it, it will speak to the local authority and environmental officers, who can then arrange to collect the carcass.Responsibility for smaller whales, as well as all porpoises, dolphins and sturgeons, lies with the local authority."
