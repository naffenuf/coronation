        "Everton will seek only their second away win of the season against BrightonThe Toffees remain 19th in the Premier League with four matches remainingSean Dyche admits relegation would have a huge impact on staff at the club\u00a0Sean Dyche has given Everton\u2019s squad a stark warning about what is at stake by admitting that livelihoods are on the line around the club.",
        "Everton have only won away from home once all season and face a team, superbly managed by Roberto De Zerbi, who are pursuing a European spot.After the trip to the Amex, Everton host a Manchester City team on the cusp on the title. Then comes a trip to Wolves before the campaign finishes when Bournemouth come to Goodison Park.\u2018The next four games not only affect people\u2019s futures but people\u2019s lives and livelihoods,\u2019 said Dyche. \u2018That is football. That is the challenge. It is right there in front of your eyes.\u2019One of the things that gave Everton an identity was David Moyes referring to it as \u2018The People\u2019s Club\u2019, where players knew the importance of who was backing them from the stands and who was working to help them behind the scenes. Would that motivate the current squad?",
        "\u2018Motivation does not win games,\u2019 Dyche responded. \u2018Performance wins games. Motivation adds to the performance, of course. We have shown enough that we can win games. It is piecing it together at the right times.\u2018The key moments are in the games. Things around that in the departments still need to be done. Otherwise you are just putting a sticking plaster on something.\u2018There is loads going on behind the results. But the results are still the key thing. It is just how it is. We need to get the job done, get to the summer then start all the big stuff.\u2019",
        "\u2018The bigger picture has to be shaping the whole club to get it in the right direction. It can\u2019t just be, \u201cOh, we have stayed up again!\u201d That is not building anything. That is just surviving. We want to be growing.\u2019EVERTON (4-2-3-1) Pickford; Patterson, Keane, Tarkowski, Mykolenko; Gueye, Onana; McNeil, Doucoure, Iwobi: Calvert-Lewin."
