        "The New England Revolution extended their unbeaten streak to eight games with a 2-0 win against host Toronto FC on Saturday.",
        "The Revolution (7-1-3, 24 points) are 5-0-3 during their run and improved to 6-0-2 when scoring first this season.Toronto (2-3-6, 12 points) lost for the first time at home.Toronto goalkeeper Sean Johnson had to be sharp early in the first half, denying Ema Boateng from the left side in the 15th minute and then a minute later getting his leg to stop another Boateng chance.Striker Lorenzo Insigne had a chance to get Toronto on the board in the 18th minute with a shot from midfield, but the ball rolled wide of the net.A minute later, the Revolution took a 1-0 lead off the foot of Bobby Wood. The forward beat Toronto defender Sigurd Rosted in a battle at midfield and took it to the penalty spot before sending it through the legs of Johnson, who came off his line, and into the back of the net.The home side quickly pressed for the equalizer in the ensuing minutes.In the 21st minute, Richie Laryea cut in from the left but dragged his shot just wide and in the 25th minute, midfielder Brandon Servania came close with a shot that just went high.Toronto had a pair of opportunities to level the score with free kicks in the 32nd and 34 minutes, but Federico Bernadeschi sent the ball into the wall and Insigne's shot toward the top left corner went over the net.",
        "DeJuan Jones capitalized on a rebound to make it 2-0 Revolution in the 62nd minute.Boateng sent a cross to Carles Gil in the box that was stopped by Johnson, but the ball was loose at the top of the goal area for Jones to put it in the net.--Field Level Media"
