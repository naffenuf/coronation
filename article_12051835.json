        "WASHINGTON, May 5 (Reuters) - US President Joe Biden sharply criticized 'MAGA' Republicans for their refusal to vote in a higher federal debt ceiling, signaling that there would be little compromise from the White House at a key May 9 meeting with congressional leaders.",
        "Republicans are \"divided\" on the debt ceiling, Biden said, speaking ahead of a meeting on US investment at the White House, and so-called MAGA Republicans are pushing \"draconian\" cuts in the budget.\"The last thing this country needs ... is a manufactured crisis,\" he said.
