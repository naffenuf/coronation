        "Drives face unfair fines if councils grab powers to issue yellow box penaltiesOutside London, only police have the power to punish motorists in England\u00a0But RAC says 27 councils have put forward proposals to enforce 111 boxes\u00a0A list of 111 yellow box junctions where councils want to use new rules allowing them to issue fines was revealed today amid concerns drivers risk unfair fines.",
        "Town hall chiefs have been accused of declaring war on motorists amid concerns over problems with the boxes such as poor visibility and them being too large.Research commissioned by the RAC has investigated the boxes - which motorists should not enter unless their exit is clear - as councils push for enforcement powers.Drivers face fines for stopping in the boxes unless they are waiting to turn right. In England outside London, only police forces have the power to punish motorists.But research by the RAC found that 27 councils have put forward proposals to enforce 111 boxes under legislation introduced by the Government in May last year. If successful, they can issue their own fines, which are up to \u00a3160 in London.",
        "The RAC said there are issues with 90 per cent of the 111 boxes which are 'likely to lead to drivers being fined unfairly' as it published a major study into them.The council with the highest number of yellow boxes affected is Reading, which has a total of 17 across 15 sites in the Berkshire borough.That local authority is followed by South Gloucestershire Council which has 12 across three sites; and Herefordshire Council which has eight across eight sites.Behind those, Trafford Council has seven across two sites, while Oldham Council also has seven but across six sites.",
        "Yellow boxes are used in an attempt to ensure traffic flows smoothly through busy junctions.Motorists should not enter them unless their exit is clear or they are waiting to turn right.The RAC said to avoid inadvertently breaking the rules, drivers must be able to clearly see boxes and where they end.Successful applicant councils will be able to issue penalty charge notices (PCNs) to offending drivers.On Transport for London's (TfL) red routes, PCNs are \u00a3160, reduced to \u00a380 if paid within 14 days.Chartered engineer Sam Wright was commissioned by the RAC to analyse the 111 boxes which councils have put forward proposals to enforce.The RAC said there are issues with 90 per cent of the boxes which are 'likely to lead to drivers being fined unfairly'.Forty boxes were found to pose visibility difficulties such as faded road markings, while 18 extend beyond junctions.Mr Wright, who was formerly responsible for the design and approval of yellow boxes on TfL's road network, said: 'I haven't seen a single proposal that reviews the visibility of the box from a driver's point of view.'If you also factor in bad weather, poor light and other vehicles, then the poor visibility situation is exacerbated.'This is all very concerning, especially as enforcement is carried out via cameras high in the air. Many of the boxes have been around for years, perhaps decades.",
        "'It appears that many authorities have simply assumed that the boxes already on the ground are suitable for enforcement without carrying out a fresh assessment as is recommended in Government guidance.'",
        "RAC roads spokesman Simon Williams said: 'Fining people can have real financial consequences for those on the receiving end.'Enforcing yellow boxes means that the driver of a vehicle overhanging a box by any amount for just a moment can get a ticket.'Yet many drivers end up stopped or trapped in these junctions through no fault of their own.'It is not only imperative, but a moral duty to ensure that fines are fair, justified and that the appeals process is consistent across the country.'We urge the Government to carry out an urgent review of its yellow box junction guidance and clarify what is and isn't enforceable.'",
