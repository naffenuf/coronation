Leclerc, who broke his rear wing in the accident at Turn 8, qualified seventh.Hamilton ended Q2 an eye-watering 1.1 seconds off the pace and two tenths down on team-mate Russell.Hamilton, who returned to the pits shaking his head, took aim at Mercedes for leaving him with too much to do at the Hard Rock Stadium\u201cWe left that way too late, guys,\u201d he said over the radio. Hamilton now trails team-mate Russell 4-1 in qualifying after the opening five rounds.Hamilton, already 45 points behind championship leader Verstappen, started Saturday\u2019s running on the backfoot following a near-miss with Haas driver Kevin Magnussen.The 38-year-old was on his first speedy lap of the afternoon when he was blocked by the Dane under braking at Turn 17.Hamilton was forced to take evasive action, brushing the barriers in the process.\u201cCheck the front wing\u201d, said the Mercedes driver, who swiftly dived into the pits for repairs. \u201cI just hit the wall.\u201d",
        "The incident will be investigated by the stewards.Hamilton\u2019s afternoon then took another major setback following a scruffy lap, leaving him way down the order for Sunday\u2019s 57-lap race.\u201cIt was a difficult session,\u201d Hamilton told Sky Sports. \u201cWe\u2019re not that quick so we really needed perfect laps but it was difficult to get into a rhythm, and at the start I had that issue with the car going slow in the last corner.\u201cWhen you\u2019re fast you can be sat back and more relaxed, and you can go at the last minute and take your time. You know you\u2019re likely to make it easily into Q3.\u201cBut we knew it was very hard and there was a 50:50 chance we could get into Q3 so we need to be better with our timing.\u201cIt\u2019s done. I\u2019ll try and get my head down tomorrow and see what I can do \u2013 13th to God knows where.\u201dVerstappen looked set to secure pole after dominating practice, but he made a mistake in his first run in Q3.With less than two minutes remaining, Leclerc then lost control of his Ferrari and thudded into the wall.The session was red-flagged and did not restart, leaving Verstappen, who leads Perez by just six points in the standings, in the midfield.",
        "\u201cF*** sake,\u201d said the Dutchman over the radio after he was unable to complete his final lap.Perez\u2019s pole comes a week after his victory in Azerbaijan and provides him with the chance to take the lead of the world championship.\u201cIt has been a bad weekend,\u201d said the Mexican, who had struggled to get up to speed in his Red Bull before qualifying. \u201cBut we made a small change and everything came alive.\u201cTomorrow is an opportunity starting from pole and we will go out there and enjoy this amazing crowd.\u201dBoth McLarens failed to progress from Q1 with Lando Norris 16th and rookie team-mate Oscar Piastri last but one on another sobering evening for the British team.The television feed immediately cut to McLaren CEO Zak Brown whose pained expression was evident to see.Williams driver Logan Sargeant, 22, who was raised in nearby Fort Lauderdale, will bring up the rear for his first F1 race on home soil."
