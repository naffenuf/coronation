        "She then revealed members of her family had been calling her ever since\u00a0The Sunday Telegraph reported she was dating\u00a0Brown.'You know my aunt called and checked as well. No, it's hogwash,' she said, adding that she had 'no idea' where the tabloids got the story from.\u00a0'I haven't even had my second coffee yet, you two,' Sarah laughed. 'I'm too busy and boring [for this].'",

        "Brown, who has quit Channel Ten and will join the Seven Network in July, said that media speculation about his romantic interests is 'funny' to him, but can be a lot to handle for his loved ones.Meanwhile, Harris announced her split from IT specialist husband Tom Ward in March 2021, after seven years of marriage.The former couple share custody of sons Paul, seven, and Harry, five."
