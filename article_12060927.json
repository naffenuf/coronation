        "Roberto De Zerbi was heavily critical of Brighton after their 5-1 loss to Everton\u00a0De Zerbi accused his team of being mentally weak following the heavy defeat\u00a0Defeat is a blow for Brighton's hopes of securing European qualification\u00a0Roberto De Zerbi accused Brighton\u2019s players of being mentally weak as he held an angry post-match dressing room inquest at the Amex Stadium.",
        "Everton started the day as the lowest scorers of all the Premier League and EFL\u2019s 92 clubs but ended it having scored five goals from counter-attacks.\u00a0That lifted Sean Dyche\u2019s team out of the bottom three, but bruised Brighton\u2019s push for Europe under De Zerbi.Everton\u2019s Neal Maupay could be seen waiting more than half an hour after full-time to see old Brighton team-mates but they were still locked in with De Zerbi.\u00a0Speaking afterwards, the Italian did not hold back as he said: \u2018We didn\u2019t forget the victory against Manchester United.\u00a0",
        "'The biggest quality of the big team is to forget when you win. You have to be ready to play every game, every day, and we arrived at the stadium late \u2013 in the second half.'Brighton beat United 1-0 at the Amex on Thursday but found themselves trailing 3-0 at half time to Everton, and they face Arsenal next.\u2018If you watched the game with Man United, and if you watched this game, you can watch two completely different teams,' De Zerbi added.\u00a0'What is the problem? The problem, maybe, is the mentally \u2013 in your head.'I hope we can remember this date for a long time. What you did in the past is not important. It doesn\u2019t count. We are Brighton. We won against Liverpool, against Man United, against Chelsea, not because there is a top coach, not because there are top players, but because we showed pride, we showed courage, energy, passion.\u2019",
        "Everton face Manchester City next and this was a good day for Dyche. His son, Max, won promotion from League Two with Northampton.\u2018The feel-good factor is very important,\u2019 Dyche said. \u2018But I said to them, \"Lads, it's only another step\". I said that after Arsenal. We've made another step, but there are three more big steps we need to make.\u2019Goalkeeper Jordan Pickford added: \u2018We still have three cup finals and we have to keep going. We have to keep believing and focus on Everton, not what is around us.\u2019"
