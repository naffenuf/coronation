        "Clubs must stop operating an \u201cold boys\u2019 network\u201d and use objective processes to recruit managers and coaches, Kick It Out chief executive Tony Burnett has said.",
        "A report from the Black Footballers Partnership in March found the number of management-related positions held by black employees rose by eight in 2022 compared with the previous year, from 49 among 1,338 individuals (3.7 per cent) to 57 individuals out of 1,304 in 2023 (4.4 per cent).There are currently no black or minority ethnic managers in the Premier League following the sacking of Patrick Vieira at Crystal Palace. When you look at the representation across football, what's really clear is there is a myth of meritocracy.  Kick It Out chief executive Tony Burnett  Kick It Out wants football\u2019s new independent regulator to oversee equality standards as part of a code of football governance and to compel clubs to share representation and recruitment data, with Burnett insisting far too much in football is going on in the shadows.\u201cFootball is one of the last bastions of the old boys\u2019 network, to be absolutely frank,\u201d he told the PA news agency at the Include Summit in Manchester.\u201cIt\u2019s a tap on the shoulder quite often, who you know rather than what you know.\u201cWhen you look at the representation across football, what\u2019s really clear is there is a myth of meritocracy.\u201cThe best people aren\u2019t getting jobs, whichever way you look at this, the best people, the most qualified people, are very frequently not getting the jobs. And so we want fair representation.\u201d",
        "Kick It Out wants to work with the football authorities to put an objective assessment process in place which guides recruiters, as happens in other industries like the financial sector.\u201cWhen clubs are recruiting a manager they would have a definitive list to pick from \u2013 people who\u2019ve been through an objective process \u2013 rather than going off the recommendations of a mate of a mate, or an agent, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to stop,\u201d Burnett added.\u201cFootball is one of the last industries around where a tap on the shoulder and who you know seems to drive your career path.\u201cIt\u2019s far too informal and it\u2019s against modern recruitment standards. You\u2019re not going to get the best people if it\u2019s done in a way that isn\u2019t objective.\u201dThe Government\u2019s White Paper on football governance published in February proposed that equality, diversity and inclusion would fall outside the new regulator\u2019s immediate scope.The paper said: \u201cThe industry has taken on greater accountability and the Government will continue to support reform in this space.\u201dHowever, Kick It Out and Burnett are insistent EDI matters must form part of the regulator\u2019s final remit and is \u201cexpectant and determined\u201d that they will.\u201cFootball has been marking its own homework in this space for a long time,\u201d he said.",
        "\u201cWhen football says \u2018actually, leave us alone, we\u2019re gonna get this right\u2019 \u2013 well you haven\u2019t got it right in the last 30 years so we\u2019ve got no confidence you\u2019re going to get it right now.\u201cThis is a huge opportunity for us to put some compliance mechanisms around football to get it right.\u201dBurnett insists there remain big gaps in data related to EDI, both in terms of representation and the reporting of discrimination.\u201cWe\u2019ve got lots of different mechanisms in reporting when it comes to fan behaviour, 92 clubs all with separate reporting mechanisms, (Kick It Out) have a reporting mechanism, lots of other organisations do, but we never have a full picture of the data because the clubs aren\u2019t mandated to share that,\u201d he said.\u201cMore importantly for us, we have no idea what the culture is like within the football environment.\u201cBecause there is no compulsion for clubs to share internal discrimination reports, employee to employee for example, or employee against line manager, we have no idea what the extent of the problem is within football, and so we\u2019ve no idea what sort of cultural problem we\u2019ve got to tackle.\u201cIt\u2019s all right tackling diversity, but if we don\u2019t try and make football a more inclusive culture, then there\u2019s no point bringing more (diverse) people in, because they will leave.\u201d"
