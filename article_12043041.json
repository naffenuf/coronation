        "The Conservative chairman has repeated claims his party could lose 1,000 councillors in May\u2019s local elections but denied he would quit if they had a bad night.",
        "Greg Hands said independent experts had made the prediction and denied he was overplaying the potential losses on May 4, which will be Prime Minister Rishi Sunak\u2019s first electoral test.\u201cThose are independent academics and the leading academics in the country on the subjects of local council elections \u2013 Rallings &amp; Thrasher and Professor John Curtice \u2013 that is what they are saying, that the Conservatives are set to lose 1,000 seats.\u201cWe\u2019ll have to wait and see.\u201cI know that I find from activists and councillors ad council candidates, in places like here in South Gloucestershire, that people are more upbeat and more optimistic.\u201dWithin hours of the Conservatives losing both the Tiverton and Honiton and Wakefield Parliamentary by-elections last year, then party chairman Oliver Dowden had quit.",
        "Asked if he would be resigning, Mr Hands replied: \u201cNo very much not. We\u2019re getting on with the job.\u201cWe are delivering on Rishi Sunak\u2019s five priorities overall.\u201cWe are making sure that we fight a good set of local elections.\u201cConservative councils are very much worthwhile voting for \u2013 the councils, the councillors, the council candidates, these are people who are delivering better public services at a lower cost.\u201dDuring a campaign visit to South Gloucestershire, Mr Hands said voters on the doorstep were receptive to the Prime Minister\u2019s five pledges on halving inflation, growing the economy, cutting debt, reducing NHS waiting lists and stopping the small boat channel crossings.",
        "\u201cThe reason for voting Conservative is clear that a Conservative council costs you less and delivers better public services for less money,\u201d Mr Hands said.\u201cIn Conservative-run councils you are less likely to be a victim of crime, you\u2019re more likely to have your potholes filled and your bins collected more regularly,\u201cConservative councils deliver more for a lower cost.\u201cPeople are warming to that Conservative local message.\u201cSouth Gloucestershire is a really important council.\u201cIt\u2019s a well-run conservative council that delivers very good quality public services at a lower rate of council tax, significantly lower than Labour-run Bristol next door.\u201cI think people also react well to Rishi Sunak and to his five priorities of halving inflation, cutting the debt, restoring growth, cutting hospital waiting lists and stopping the boats.\u201cPeople respond well to those five priorities and those are very much the people\u2019s priorities as well.\u201dMr Hands also accused Sir Keir Starmer of \u201cflip-flopping\u201d after the Labour leader criticised the Conservative record on housebuilding at Prime Minister\u2019s Questions.\u201cOf course, people need housing and in fact this Government has delivered 2.3 million new homes since 2010 \u2013 that\u2019s a lot of homes,\u201d he said.\u201cHousebuilding is recovering and after the pandemic house building slowed considerably.\u201cWe\u2019re providing more homes right the way across the board and I think Keir Starmer needs to say what does he actually stand for?",
        "\u201cHe\u2019s flip flopped so often on these things, as with almost everything else.\u201cThe Conservatives say we need a strong local voice as well when it comes to house building, that houses need to be built in appropriate areas we need to protect the greenbelt and so on.\u201d",
        "Voters in 230 local authorities across England are going to the polls on Thursday and elections are also taking place to choose mayors in Bedford, Leicester, Mansfield and Middlesbrough.Many of the seats being contested this year were last up for election in 2019.The Conservatives will be hoping to keep losses to a minimum, while Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer and Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey will be judged on whether their parties are able to make gains at the expense of the Conservatives."
