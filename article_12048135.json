        "The trio - Gary Barlow, Mark Owen and Howard Donald - have re-worked their beloved number one track with the help of singer Calum Scott.Calum told The Sun: 'I was really nervous about jumping on a song that was already such a smash and recording on my vocal in there but it was also such an honour.'Gary and I hit the studio together for a day working on a new section and doing new vocals and then we went it to the boys [Mark and Howard] to rerecord their parts.'Calum also chatted to Gary about writing some new, original music together.'",
        "He said: 'We said after this track we want to get in the studio together and write original music.'I'm in the middle of working on my third album so hopefully we can do something for that.'I'm excited to be able to work with him. Even being linked to a band like Take That is wild.'DJ Robin Schulz has added some dance influence to the stripped-back, anthemic number, which will also appear in the musical.\u00a0Speaking about the new song, Take That said: 'Greatest Day is a special song for us - it was one of our biggest singles, and our 11th No.1.'It's been fantastic being in the studio working on the new version of the track with Calum and Robin, both such talented artists.",
