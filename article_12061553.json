        "The ghostwriter behind the Duke of Sussex\u2019s controversial memoir Spare has recalled the \u201cfrenzied\u201d response to the book\u2019s publication.",
        "John Moehringer said that in the days and weeks after the release he had been harassed and \u201cstalked\u201d by members of the media, and that passages in the book had been \u201chyped into outrages\u201d.In an article for The New Yorker, Moehringer recounted his experience with the duke, after having been approached to ghostwrite his memoir in the summer of 2020.He said the pair had argued over details of the book multiple times, including a heated row at 2am in 2022 over an anecdote about Harry\u2019s military training.",
        "The duke had been involved in a \u201cgruelling\u201d terrorist capture simulation, during which he had been beaten, that had culminated in an insult being made about his mother Diana, Princess of Wales.Moehringer said Harry had requested he include his response to the \u201ccaptors\u201d but he had refused, telling the duke it would \u201cdilute\u201d the scene\u2019s meaning.\u201cAlthough this wasn\u2019t the first time that Harry and I had argued, it felt different,\u201d he said.\u201cIt felt as if we were hurtling toward some kind of decisive rupture, in part because Harry was no longer saying anything\u2026 he was just glaring.\u201dSpare became the fastest-selling non fiction book in the UK of all time when it was published in January 2023.Moehringer said that following the publication, the response had been that of a \u201cfrenzied mob\u201d and that he and his family had been targeted by the paparazzi.",
        "\u201cThe British press now converted the book into their native tongue, that jabberwocky of bonkers hot takes and classist snark,\u201d he said.\u201cFacts were wrenched out of context, complex emotions were reduced to cartoonish idiocy, innocent passages were hyped into outrages\u2014and there were so many falsehoods.\u201d The British press now converted the book into their native tongue, that jabberwocky of bonkers hot takes and classist snark.  John Moehringer  He recalled how while taking his son to preschool, he had been \u201cstalked\u201d by a paparazzo, who had stood in the middle of a road in order to take a picture.Moehringer added that a newspaper journalist had appeared at his window while he was working later that same day.In the first-person piece he said that the experience had helped him understand Harry better, after his name was leaked ahead of Spare\u2019s publication.Moehringer has ghostwritten for other high-profile celebrities including former tennis champion Andre Agassi and Nike co-founder Phil Knight.The full article can be read online on The New Yorker\u2019s website.It comes after Harry returned to his home in Montecito, California, after a brief visit to the UK for the King\u2019s coronation on Saturday."
