        "Wander Franco slowed down time and pulled off a highlight play vs. Pittsburgh\u00a0Fans on social media ate it up, but feared backlash over 'unwritten rules'\u00a0DailyMail.com provides all the latest international sports news\u00a0Tampa Bay Rays shortstop Wander Franco decided to have some fun at his job while fielding a routine ground ball.",
        "In the top of the seventh inning in Wednesday night's game against the Pittsburgh Pirates, Brian Reynolds hit a ground ball to the third year shortstop.Franco caught his hot grounder on a hop, pulled the ball out of his glove, spun it in the air, grabbed the ball in midair (and midspin), and fired it over to first for the easy out.Later that inning, Franco smacked a home run to extend Tampa's lead - watching it fly and pointing to his teammates in the dugout.Fans on social media reacted with glee, calling the move a 'ball flip' - the defensive version of a 'bat flip'. But they also anticipated some backlash from people who may be offended by his breaking of contrived, ancient 'unwritten rules' of baseball.\u00a0",
        "ESPN writer Joon Lee reacted to the smooth moves, saying, 'I think Wander Franco just unlocked a new level of breaking the unwritten rules.'Another user commented, saying, 'If you don't think this is extremely cool, you have to either adapt or leave.'\u00a0Other baseball fans loved the play Franco displayed, saying, 'this rules and is a little leaguer's dream' or 'imagine being this cool'.Tampa Bay won the game 8-1 - continuing their hot streak atop baseball. They play Pittsburgh again Thursday afternoon."
