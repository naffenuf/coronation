        "Finance ministry to announce FX selling plan on May 4May 3 (Reuters) - Russia's finance ministry is expected to reduce its sale of foreign currency for state reserves to around $344.2 million in the coming month, a Reuters survey showed on Wednesday.The finance ministry will announce its plan for the period of May 10 to June 6 at 0900 GMT on Thursday.The median forecast from a survey of four analysts suggested Russia would sell 27.5 billion roubles ($344.2 million) worth of foreign currency in regular sales on the open market under its fiscal rule.Individual forecasts ranged from 0 to 60 billion roubles.In the previous period, between April 7 and May 5, the ministry had planned to sell 74.6 billion roubles worth of foreign currency to compensate for lower oil and gas revenues.The finance ministry in January said it was restarting foreign currency operations in Chinese yuan, to boost the stability of domestic economic conditions and reduce the impact of energy market volatility on Russia's economy and public finances.Russia halted FX interventions last year as the West imposed sweeping sanctions against Moscow - which included freezing about $300 billion in foreign exchange reserves - after it launched what it called a \"special military operation\" in Ukraine.",
