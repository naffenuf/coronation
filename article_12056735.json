        "Peterborough boss Darren Ferguson praised his side\u2019s first-half performance as they clinched the final Sky Bet League One play-off place with a 2-0 win at fourth-placed Barnsley.",
        "Top scorer Jonson Clarke-Harris opened the scoring in the sixth minute, with Jack Taylor doubling the lead in the second half.Peterborough will face Sheffield Wednesday \u2013 who beat Posh\u2019s rivals Derby \u2013 in the play-off semi-finals, with Barnsley facing Bolton.Ferguson said: \u201cWe got the result we needed and got a favour off Sheffield Wednesday, so it went exactly to plan.\u201cI thought we started the game ever so well, I\u2019ve spoken all week about getting an early goal and making Derby nervous.On his side\u2019s second goal, Ferguson said: \u201cThe second goal was pivotal, obviously I\u2019m aware Derby are losing I had to stick or twist to try and get a third.",
        "\u201cBut in the end it didn\u2019t matter because we managed to get the win.\u201dWednesday led Derby at half-time and, asked whether that scoreline impacted his half-time team talk, Ferguson continued: \u201cThe main focus was on how we performed and making sure we did our bit.\u201cI did tell them Derby were getting beaten and were down to 10 men, I had to tell them because I didn\u2019t want to be wasting an opportunity that was in front of us.\u201dFerguson was asked whether past experience will help with the play-off games and responded: \u201cIt could do, I\u2019m used to it. I enjoy these types of games and this time of the season, it\u2019s very rare I don\u2019t have much to play for whether it be promotion or relegation.\u201d",
        "Barnsley head coach Michael Duff said: \u201c(I\u2019m) a little bit frustrated, to be honest, we\u2019ve been done by a set-play.\u201cIt\u2019s tough to replicate the intensity and concentration that\u2019s needed to play in these types of games.\u201cCredit to Peterborough, they\u2019re a good team. I\u2019m frustrated about when the second goal came in, I think we went flat after that and never really looked like getting back into the game.\u201cThe last two weeks have been tough, but we\u2019ve had a brilliant season and now we need to tune in again.Barry Cotter caught the eye for the hosts and Duff said: \u201cHe was one of the big ones today, I thought he was excellent.\u201cHe\u2019s got loads of physical attributes, sometimes he needs to simplify his game but I think we can coach him.Captain Mads Andersen continues to be sidelined and Duff admitted: \u201cIt\u2019s a concern, he\u2019s still not training with the group.\u201cHopefully he\u2019ll be fine but our promotion hopes don\u2019t depend on Mads Andersen.Looking ahead to the upcoming double-header against Bolton, Duff added: \u201cTough games, but who are you going to pick that isn\u2019t a tough game?\u201cThe last couple of weeks have been tough but we can focus in now.\u201d"
