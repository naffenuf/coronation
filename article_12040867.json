        "Jenson Button believes Lewis Hamilton will sign a new deal with Mercedes because he remains \u201chungry\u201d to win his record eighth world championship.",
        "Speaking before the start of the season, Button, the 2009 world champion, suggested Hamilton will only extend his contract \u2013 which expires at the end of the year \u2013 if Mercedes can provide him with a winning car.Hamilton finished sixth last weekend in Azerbaijan and already trails championship leader Max Verstappen by 45 after just four rounds, with the Dutchman\u2019s Red Bull team in a league of their own this year.However, Button, 43, said: \u201cI don\u2019t think Lewis is going to walk away from the sport.\u201cAs a racing driver, if you have been winning for so long and then you are suddenly not, you want to fight back to winning ways. You are not going to retire.\u201cIf you are in a bad car for many years, you want to retire because it just gets you down, but Lewis is not in a bad car. He is just in a car that is not as good as what he has been used to, and I get that.\u201cBut he knows the strength of the team, he knows how quick he still is, so he is going to work with this team to get back to fighting with Red Bull, and they will. It probably won't be this year, but in 2024, we will see Lewis on the grid. He is still hungry to win another world championship  Jenson Button  ",
        "\u201cIt probably won\u2019t be this year, but in 2024, we will see Lewis on the grid. He is still hungry to win another world championship.\u201dVerstappen remains the overwhelming favourite to win his third consecutive title despite Sergio Perez moving to within six points of his Red Bull team-mate after winning the sprint race and Grand Prix in Baku.And Button said another victory at Sunday\u2019s Miami Grand Prix will fuel Perez with confidence that he can beat Verstappen to the title.",
        "\u201cI\u2019ve been really impressed with Sergio,\u201d added Button.\u201cMax has to be the toughest team-mate because he just goes out there and gets it done.\u201cConsistency is where Sergio has been lacking, but if he can do it in Miami, which like Baku is a street race, too, he has a chance to fight for the championship.\u201cI didn\u2019t think I would be saying that, I really didn\u2019t, but it is good for the sport. Red Bull has an advantage at the moment and we need both of them to be fighting it out.\u201d"
