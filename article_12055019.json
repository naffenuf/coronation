        "A British expat who participated in preparations for the late Queen\u2019s coronation in 1953 says worldwide interest in royal events shows that \u201chuman beings love ceremony\u201d.",
        "Michael Vincent had been one of the \u201ctest groups\u201d and had marched in a practice procession almost exactly 70 years ago \u2013 when he was 18 years old.Mr Vincent, now 88, watched replays of the King\u2019s coronation on Saturday morning from Ye Olde King\u2019s Head pub in Santa Monica, California, alongside fellow expats and US anglophiles.",
        "Recalling the build-up to the previous coronation, he told the PA news agency: \u201cMy aunt came down to see me march past.\u201cI was playing the tenor drum because I couldn\u2019t carry a tune so I had the easy job, just twirling the sticks.\u201cYou just did what you were told in those days. It was historic but we didn\u2019t really think of it that way.\u201dAsked his opinions on the coronation events going on back in the UK, he added: \u201cHuman beings love ceremony\u201d.",
        "\u201cEverywhere you go, whether you go to Cairo and look at the Pyramids, there is always ceremonies,\u201d he told PA.\u201cThe weakness of human beings is that they\u2019re always showing off, that\u2019s why they go dancing on Saturday night.\u201dA special schedule of royal-themed events is due to take place at Ye Olde King\u2019s Head on Saturday to offer expats a slice of home, despite being more than 5,000 miles away.",
        "The pub often marks significant royal events and celebrations, having put on events for the Platinum Jubilee and funeral of Queen Elizabeth II.As well as ceremony replays on Saturday, a special coronation high-tea is on offer, followed by a \u201cBritish bangers\u201d DJ set and a Beatles tribute band.",
        "The gift shop is stocked with commemorative merchandise, which includes mugs, postcards, flags and tea towels, with Union flag bunting already proudly displayed, with a large cardboard cut-out of Charles in pride of place.Lara Ramdin, originally from St Albans, said it was \u201cgood for the world to see all the pomp and circumstance\u201d.\u201cIt\u2019s a momentous occasion and I didn\u2019t necessarily want to get up at two o\u2019clock in the morning and watch everything,\u201d she told PA.\u201cMy friend is an anglophile and I knew that if I said I wanted to commemorate the coronation in some way by being in a British place surrounded by British people she would join me.\u201dShe added: \u201c(And) why not celebrate with an English breakfast? Also you can get a decent cup of tea here and it wouldn\u2019t seem right without that.\u201d"
