        "Eight children and guard have been killed in a shooting at a school in BelgradeThe suspect, named as Kosta Kecmanovic, was arrested in the school yardA 13-year-old boy who has been arrested for killing eight children and a security guard in a school shooting may be too young to face criminal sanctions, prosecutors have revealed.",
        "Kosta Kecmanovic, 13, identified by police as the suspected shooter, opened fire in his classroom at a Belgrade school this morning, Serbian police said.The baby-faced teenager has now been pictured after he was arrested in the Vladislav Ribnikar primary school yard and led away with his face covered.The shooter drew up plans for the massacre over a month, making sketches of classrooms which looked like a 'horror movie', Belgrade's police chief, Veselin Milic, revealed.He was armed with two guns and two petrol bombs and had planned everything meticulously, even compiling a list with the names of children he wanted to kill and their classes, according to Milic.Terrified students hid under their desks amid 'non-stop shooting' at around 8.40 this morning. Kecmanovic then called police himself when the depraved attack was over.",
        "At least eight children and a security guard were killed in the gun rampage and there are fears that the death toll could rise even further, with some sustaining life-threatening injuries.Seven people were injured, including a teacher, who reports have said is fighting for their life.The shooter first killed a guard at the school in central Belgrade and then three students in a hallway, according to Milic.\u00a0He then entered a classroom - apparently choosing it simply because it was close to the entrance - and opened fire again, Milic said.\u00a0Body bags have since been brought out of the school to a van outside.",
        "According to Serbian legal provisions, the 13-year-old boy 'is deemed criminally irresponsible, because he has not reached the age of 14', local media has reported.The boy's father has been detained on suspicion of aggravated endangering of the public safety, it said.A drawing by the alleged shooter, which was shown to reporters, looked like 'something from a video game or a horror movie,' Milic said, 'which indicates that he planned in detail, by classes, whom to liquidate.'Most\u00a0students were able to flee through a back door, according to a local official.\u00a0Milan Milosevic, a father of one of the pupils, said his daughter was in the history class where the shooter opened fire 'randomly' at other children as they cowered under their desks.'She managed to escape,' the father told Serbian TV station N1.'He [the shooter] fired first at the teacher and then the children who ducked under the desks,' Milosevic quoted his daughter as saying.\u00a0",
        "'They say he [the shooter] was quiet and a good pupil. He recently joined their class.'\u00a0Mr Milosevic said that he rushed out to the school when he heard what had happened.'I asked where is my child but no one could tell me anything at first,' he said. 'Then she called and we found out she was out.'",
        "'I saw the security guard lying under the table. I saw two girls with blood on their shirts,' Mr Milosevic added.Evgenija, 14, said she knew the suspected gunman, who she said was\u00a0'somehow silent... appeared nice and had good grades'.\u00a0'[I] did not know much about him, he was not that open to everyone. I would never expect that this could happen,' she told reporters.'I heard noises and I thought some boys, some kids were throwing firecrackers... But then I saw the security guard falling to the ground,' she said, adding that she then ran away.",
        "Serbia's Interior Ministry said in an updated statement that eight children and a security guard were killed in the shooting, while six children and one school teacher were wounded.\u00a0'All police forces are still on the ground and are intensively working to shed light on all the facts and circumstances that led to this tragedy.'\u00a0A student who was in a sports class downstairs when the gunfire erupted said: 'I was able to hear the shooting. It was non-stop.'",
        "'I didn't know what was happening. We were receiving some messages on the phone.'\u00a0The student who heard the violence unfold, identified only by her initials, E.M. because of her age, described the suspect as a 'quiet guy' who 'looked nice.'",
        "'He was having good grades, but we didn't know much about him,' the student added. 'He was not so open with everybody. Surely I wasn't expecting this to happen. '",
        "Milan Nedeljkovic, mayor of the central Vracar district where the school is located, said doctors were fighting to save a teacher's life.Mr Nedeljkovic said the school's security guard likely prevented more deaths by putting himself in front of the shooter.The guard 'wanted to prevent the tragedy and he was the first victim,' Nedeljkovic told reporters told journalists live on television outside the school.'I saw kids running out from the school, screaming. Parents came, they were in panic. Later I heard three shots,' a girl who attends a high school adjacent to Vladislav Ribnikar told state TV RTS.\u00a0Police sealed off the blocks around the school, in the center of Belgrade.Officers in helmets and bulletproof vests cordoned off the area around the school, which is in the Vra\u010dar neighbourhood in central Belgrade.Serbian media have reported that the guard was killed in the shooting. Police gave no other details.\u00a0",
        "Local media footage from the scene showed commotion outside the school as police removed the suspect, whose head was covered as officers led him to a car parked in the street.",
        "Casualties are being treated and an investigation into the motives behind the shooting is under way.\u00a0Serbia's Interior Ministry said in a statement: 'The police sent all available patrols immediately to the spot and arrested a suspected minor - a seventh grade student who is suspected of firing several shots from his father's gun in the direction of students and school security.'Minister Bratislav Gasic said the suspect's father has also been arrested\u00a0",
        "Vra\u010dar is a wealthy area of the city and a number of embassies are based there.\u00a0A row of ambulances were pictured parked on Kralja Milutin Street outside.Police sealed off the blocks surrounding the school.\u00a0Primary schools in Serbia have eight grades.\u00a0Mass shootings in the country are extremely rare.\u00a0In the last mass shooting, a Balkan war veteran in 2013 killed 13 people in a central Serbian village.Experts, however, have repeatedly warned of the number of weapons left over in the country after the wars of the 1990s.The western Balkans are awash with hundreds of thousands of illegal weapons following the unrest there.Serbian authorities have offered several amnesties for owners to hand in or register illegal guns.This is a breaking news story.
