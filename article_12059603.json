        "Stevenage clinched second place in League Two after Jake Reeves\u2019 first-half goal earned a 1-0 victory at Barrow.",
        "The midfielder netted his first goal since the start of December, which came in the 5-0 rout over Pete Wild\u2019s Bluebirds, as Boro claimed a 24th win of the season and secured a top-two spot behind champions Leyton Orient.Both sides had early chances but the keepers were untroubled until the already promoted visitors took the lead after 25 minutes.Barrow could only half-clear Max Clark\u2019s cross to Reeves, who fired into the bottom corner from the edge of the box.After the break, Stevenage stopper Adam Przybek did well to hold onto a well-struck Robbie Gotts shot as Barrow pushed for an equaliser.The former Wales Under-21 keeper then produced a fine double save with 20 minutes remaining to deny Ged Garner from point-blank range before stopping his acrobatic effort seconds later.",
        "And Przybek once again frustrated the hosts when he kept out Josh Kay\u2019s left-footed effort five minutes later.Barrow substitute Jake Young fired over with time running out before Reeves clipped the crossbar with a late effort as Stevenage clinched the points."
