        "The world is \u201con the cusp of a first generation of treatments for Alzheimer\u2019s disease\u201d, experts have said, as a new drug was found to slow cognitive and functional decline.",
        "The drug donanemab, made by Eli Lilly and Company, slowed decline by 35% to 36% in a late-stage phase 3 clinical trial, the company said.Donanemab appeared to slow the decline associated with Alzheimer\u2019s compared with placebo in 1,182 people with early-stage disease based on those with intermediate levels of a protein known as tau.The drug also resulted in 40% less decline in the ability to perform activities of daily living, according to the firm.Almost half (47%) of those on donanemab had no clinical progression of disease at one year compared with 29% on placebo (defined as no decline in the commonly-used Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes score).Furthermore, participants on donanemab experienced a 39% lower risk of progressing to the next stage of disease compared to placebo, according to Eli Lilly.",
        " After 20 years with no new Alzheimer's drugs, we now have two potential new drugs in just 12 months  Dr Richard Oakley  In those patients receiving donanemab, brain swelling, a known side effect of drugs of this type, occurred in 24% of the participants, with 6.1% experiencing symptoms.Brain bleeding occurred in 31.4% of the donanemab group and 13.6% of the placebo group.Lilly said the incidence of serious brain swelling in the donanemab study was 1.6%, including two participants whose deaths were attributed to the condition and a third who died after an incident of serious brain swelling.",
        "It said most cases of swelling or bleeds were \u201cmild to moderate\u201d and responded to treatment.Daniel Skovronsky, Eli Lilly\u2019s chief scientific and medical officer, said: \u201cThis is the first phase 3 trial of any investigational medicine for Alzheimer\u2019s disease to deliver 35% slowing of clinical and functional decline.\u201dDr Richard Oakley, associate director of research at the Alzheimer\u2019s Society in the UK, said: \u201cAfter 20 years with no new Alzheimer\u2019s drugs, we now have two potential new drugs in just 12 months \u2013 and for the first time, drugs that seem to slow the progression of disease. This could be the beginning of the end of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\u201cBased on today\u2019s early results, donanemab appears to slow the progression of Alzheimer\u2019s symptoms by 36% (as compared with 27% of last year\u2019s breakthrough drug lecanemab).\u201cPromisingly, the trial also demonstrated a 40% slowing in decline of everyday activities such as driving, doing hobbies and managing finances.\u201cWhile we\u2019ve seen lecanemab could slow progression by over seven months, we\u2019ll need to see the full results to know if donanemab could do the same or even better.\u201dDr Susan Kolhaas, executive director of research and partnerships at Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK, said: \u201cThis is incredibly encouraging, and another hugely significant moment for dementia research.",
        " This is hugely exciting news as it provides further evidence that it is possible to slow down Alzheimer\u2019s disease  Dr Charles Marshall, Queen Mary University of London  \u201cA second drug for Alzheimer\u2019s has been shown to slow people\u2019s cognitive decline in a rigorous phase 3 trial.\u00a0We\u2019re now on the cusp of a first generation of treatments for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, something that many thought impossible only a decade ago.\u201cThe treatment effect is modest, as is the case for many first-generation drugs, and there are risks of serious side effects that need to be fully scrutinised before donanemab can be marketed and used.\u201cHowever, this news underlines the urgency of preparing the NHS to make these treatments available should regulators deem them safe and effective.\u201cPeople should be really encouraged by this news, which is yet more proof that research can take us ever closer towards a cure.\u201dDr Charles Marshall, honorary consultant neurologist at Queen Mary University of London, said: \u201cThis is hugely exciting news as it provides further evidence that it is possible to slow down Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\u201cWhen the full results are published as a paper we will be able to start carefully balancing the risks and benefits, and this will inform decisions about whether donanemab should be routinely given to patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease.",
        "\u201cFor this to be possible, we will also need substantial new investment in dementia clinics that can deliver accurate diagnosis, treatments that are given as infusions, and appropriate safety monitoring.\u201cWithout this, there is a very real risk that existing health inequalities are exacerbated as only a few patients living near large teaching hospitals will be able to benefit.\u201dJohn Hardy, professor of neuroscience and group leader at the UK Dementia Research Institute, University College London, said: \u201cIt is great news to have a success with a second anti-amyloid Alzheimer drug.\u201cThis should dispel any lingering doubts about this approach. Having two drugs is great for competition.\u201dDr Tom Russ, director of the Alzheimer Scotland Dementia Research Centre, said: \u201cThe results of the donanemab trial are very welcome and will bring many people with dementia and their families some much-needed hope.\u201cThe top line results do not give much detail and the publication of the full results in the summer will be very helpful.\u201cWhile this is another encouraging development, the UK NHS is not ready to implement an infusion-based therapy such as donanemab or lecanemab, should they become licensed treatments in the UK.\u201cThere needs to be significant support for struggling dementia assessment services which are still emerging from the Covid-19 pandemic to continue to diagnose, treat, and support people currently presenting while developing new ways to implement the disease-modifying treatments of the (near) future.\u201d",
        "The study also enrolled a smaller number of people (552) with high levels of tau, representing later stages of the disease.When this group was combined with the intermediate tau group, donanemab also demonstrated \u201cmeaningful positive results\u201d, Eli Lilly said, with a 29% slowing of decline on the commonly used Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes."
