        "In a break from tradition, King Charles added crowned royals to the guest list for this coronation, meaning a number of\u00a0kings and queens were able to take part in the pageantry.For centuries, convention dictated that no other crowned royals should attend the coronation of a British monarch, in a tradition that lasted for 900 years.This was based on the idea that the sacred event should be an intimate exchange between the monarch and their people, in the presence of God.But Charles decided against this , which marks one of the ways he has tried to modernise the ceremony, meaning his crowned friends, including European royals and rulers from Arab states made it onto the guest list.",
