Foles completed 25 of 42 passes for 224 yards, zero touchdowns, and four interceptions as the Colts lost both of his starts.Foles won Super Bowl LII while he was with the Philadelphia Eagles - taking over for an injured Carson Wentz late in the season and winning the award for the big game's most valuable player.\u00a0Indianapolis was wayward last season with its quarterback selection, as it struggled to a 4-12-1 record while rotating between Foles, Matt Ryan, and Sam Ehlinger.",
        "This offseason, the Colts picked up free agent quarterback Gardner Minshew - who could be their starting QB for Week 1.But just last Thursday, Indianapolis drafted their projected quarterback-of-the-future in the form of prospect Anthony Richardson.Richardson, the fourth overall pick, is widely seen as the most raw quarterback talent in this years draft pool and may need some time and experience before starting games.It's believed that new Colts head coach Shane Steichen picked Richardson because of his similar characteristics to Jalen Hurts, the Philadelphia Eagles QB that Steichen trained up while he was Philly's offensive coordinator.",
        "Whether or not Richardson will prove quickly enough to be a starting caliber signal caller in time for Week 1 remains to be seen.\u00a0"
