        "Nick Cave cut a dapper figure as he arrived at\u00a0Westminster Abbey ahead of the\u00a0Coronation of King Charles III on Saturday morning.\u00a0",
        "The Australian music icon is one of a just a handful of Aussie representatives invited to take part in the historic event.\u00a0The 65-year-old was dressed in his trademark black suit as he made his way inside alongside\u00a0Rowan Williams.\u00a0Nick appeared to go solo to the ceremony, with his wife\u00a0Susie Cave not spotted by his side.\u00a0He had earlier fought off controversy over his decision to attend the Coronation and said it was less about his political leanings and more about his love of pageantry.",
        "'I am not a monarchist, nor am I a royalist, nor am I an ardent republican for that matter,' he wrote on his personal blog The Red Hand.'What I am also not is so spectacularly incurious about the world and the way it works, so ideologically captured, so damn grouchy, as to refuse an invitation to what will more than likely be the most important historical event in the UK of our age.'Not just the most important, but the strangest, the weirdest.'In response to a fan asking 'why the f*** he would attend', he shared the story of his one and only meeting with the late Queen - revealing he had been surprised to find himself weeping while watching her funeral on TV.",
        "Cave said the Royal had seemed almost 'extraterrestrial' and was one of the most charismatic women he had ever met.'Maybe it was the lighting, but she actually glowed,' he wrote of the Queen.Cave is one of over a dozen Australians invited to attend the King's coronation.Millions of people around the globe will tune in to watch King Charles and Queen Consort Camilla be crowned at Westminster Abbey in London on Saturday.All the pomp and splendor will start at 7.30pm AEST with the King's procession to Westminster Abbey and the Coronation will begin at 8pm.",
