        "The number of mortgage approvals being made to home-buyers bounced upwards in March, according to Bank of England figures.",
        "The Bank\u2019s Money and Credit report said mortgage approvals for house purchases \u201crose significantly\u201d, to 52,000 in March from 44,100 in February.However, it said the latest total remains below the monthly average for 2022 of 62,700.Lucian Cook, head of residential research at estate agent Savills, said: \u201cToday\u2019s bounce in mortgage approvals reflects an increasingly stable and competitive mortgage market.\u201cThe ability to better plan their prospective mortgage outgoings has brought buyers back to a housing market that has proved more resilient than we feared would be the case six months ago.\u201d Cash and equity-rich buyers are likely to remain in pole position over the remainder of the next six months  Lucian Cook, Savills  Mr Cook said Savills\u2019 own research indicates that buyers\u2019 and sellers\u2019 commitment to move has improved, but added: \u201cThis said, ongoing inflationary pressures and the prospect of further rate rises mean cash and equity-rich buyers are likely to remain in pole position over the remainder of the next six months.\u201d",
        "Jason Tebb, chief executive of property search website OnTheMarket.com, said: \u201cAs the traditionally busier spring months kick into gear, it feels as though we\u2019re getting back to where we were pre-pandemic, before the stamp duty holiday and race for space distorted the market.\u201dGary Bush, a financial adviser at MortgageShop.com, said: \u201cBuyers have factored in all the doom- and-gloom rate news and a lot have, quite frankly, put off buying a property or a home improvement decision for so long that they are now out in force.\u201d",
        "Tom Bill, head of UK residential research at estate agent Knight Frank, said: \u201cProperties that tick all the right boxes will hold their value but some of the pandemic froth is disappearing so asking prices will come under pressure.\u201dLooking at households\u2019 non-mortgage borrowing, the Bank said the annual growth rate for consumer credit rose for the sixth month in a row, accelerating from 7.7% in February to 7.9% in March.Consumer credit includes borrowing using credit cards, personal loans and overdrafts.Within the total, the annual growth rate of credit card borrowing slowed, from 13.2% to 12.8% in March, while for other forms of consumer credit the growth rate rose, from 5.4% in February to 5.8% in March. The sad reality is that turning to credit to meet everyday living costs is the only solution for many households  Alice Haine, Bestinvest  Alice Haine, a personal finance analyst at investment platform Bestinvest, said: \u201cRising interest rates, sticky inflation and falling real wages are never the ideal combination for households navigating tight budgets through the cost-of-living crisis.\u201cWhile there is optimism in the air amid falling energy prices, a stabilising property market and hopes that inflation really will ease off from here, for now disposable incomes are still in retreat.",
        "\u201cThe sad reality is that turning to credit to meet everyday living costs is the only solution for many households.\u201dIn further signs of the strain on budgets, households collectively made a net withdrawal of \u00a34.8 billion from banks and building societies in March, compared with a net deposit of \u00a32.6 billion in February.Households deposited \u00a33.5 billion into National Savings and Investment (NS&amp;I) accounts during March \u2013 the highest total since September 2020.Money held in NS&amp;I accounts has the security of being backed by the Treasury, guaranteeing 100% of the amount invested.Cash deposits held with banks and building societies meanwhile are generally protected by up to \u00a385,000 per eligible person.Myron Jobson, senior personal finance analyst at interactive investor, said: \u201cMoney poured out of savings accounts held by banks and building societies in March, while deposits into NS&amp;I accounts jumped again \u2013 offering the clearest indication of savers\u2019 sentiment amid the turmoil in the banking sector following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.\u201dUK non-financial businesses borrowed, on net, \u00a32.5 billion of bank and building society loans, including overdrafts, in March, compared with \u00a34.3 billion of net repayments in February."
