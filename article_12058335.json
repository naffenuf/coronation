        "'Warren's vocal tone is very strong,' Alanis said. 'If Warren takes some of the revelations from today. And he creates this range for himself; it's no holds barred for him.'After he finished, Alanis thanked him for doing a different version of her song and adding to it.'This is a version I have never imagined ever hearing in my whole career so thank you for adding to it and blossoming,' Alanis said.",

'That was great guys.'Ryan checked in with Katy and Lionel\u00a0 who were in London for King Charles III coronation events.'Everybody's doing such great jobs,' Katy said. 'I think mostly that's because they have such great songs to actually choose from. They sound so wonderful for the Alanis songs and so wonderful with the Ed songs. Thank you so much for taking our jobs.'",
        "Ryan asked Lionel if he was staying out of trouble. Lionel showed them that he had learned a new wave during his time at the coronation.

'Obviously it's a song that everybody knows but you are doing it in your own way and then rocking out.'Alanis then took the stage herself and performed her hit Thank You. The crowd gave her a standing ovation. Ryan asked her what it was like to mentor the contestants.'I've had people in my life who supported me, coached me, gave me feedback that I actually wanted versus the onslaught of unsolicited feedback that people get and so it's me paying it forward to support people,' Alanis said.Alanis said she was also going on a world tour.Haven and Zachariah then performed Ed's hit Thinking Out Loud that was recently the subject of a federal copyright infringement lawsuit.'I usually find when people who cover my songs they usually sing better than I do,' Ed said.

Ed played guitar and sang the entire time with his eyes closed.

Being an English artist, America is always like this holy grail where a lot of people try and a lot of people fail,' Ed said.

I'm really happy to be back.''We are glad you are back,' Ryan said.Ryan asked him also why he decided to make his documentary The Sum of It All that was now streaming on the Disney+ service.",
        "'I said yes to making a documentary on the making of the album, the music videos and while they were filming it stuff just started unravelling in my life. And I think they were secretly happy about that,' Sheeran said. 'It wasn't the documentary I was intending to make, but I think it's a lot more human. It's not a music documentary, it's more life.'",
        "Iam went next with his solo performance of Alanis' hit Guardian that he dedicated to his mother Lily. Alanis said she was almost brought to tears by him singing it to her.The crowd chanted his name when he finished.'The empathy in your voice,' Alanis said. 'You have this velvety voice and the planet I believe needs empathy now more than ever.''I just felt like you really connected with the song and it makes us listeners really connect with it,' Sheeran said.

'Pride is an interesting thing, I barely know you but I'm proud of you.''I felt it,' Sheeran said. 'I feel like you conveyed the emotion really well. I thought it was a really entertaining performance.'",
