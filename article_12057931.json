        "This past October, Selena and Hailey cuddled up to one another for the cameras at the Academy Museum gala, suggesting they had buried the hatchet.By this February however Hailey found herself denying claims that she had taken a swipe at Selena on TikTok, and speculation exploded that the pair were on the outs.Then last month Selena wrote on social media:\u00a0'Hailey Bieber reached out to me and let me know that she has been receiving death threats and such hateful negativity.'She declared: 'This isn't what I stand for. No one should have to experience hate or bullying. I've always advocated for kindness and really want this all to stop.'"
