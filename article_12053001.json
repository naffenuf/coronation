'You'd almost have to intentionally jump.'\u00a0This is not the first time a fan has suffered an injury due to a fall at a Major League Baseball game.\u00a0In 2011, a firefighter named Shannon Stone fell from a significant height while trying to haul in a home run hit by Texas Rangers slugger Josh Hamilton. Stone would ultimately pass away due to the injuries he suffered.Four years later, an Atlanta Braves fan named Gregory Murrey died after falling from the upper deck at Turner Field, the club's former stadium.Fans remained on the railing later in the game in Ashburn Alley, named after Hall of Famer and former Phillies outfielder Richie Ashburn, which has been a popular hangout spot since the ballpark opened in 2004. In addition to the railing over the bullpen, which includes a ledge to accommodate food and beverages, fans also can watch relievers closely from a seated area that also has a ledge.Some fans wondered on Friday night if they would be prohibited from watching the game from that area going forward after the fan's fall.",
        "In the initial plan for the ballpark, Phillies relievers were seated on the top part of the bullpen closest to the fans. But the visiting bullpen was switched to the top level and the home bullpen was moved below."
