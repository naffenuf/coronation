        "At the time she was hesitant to go under the knife but it was her late father Ashok - who happened to be a doctor himself - who persuaded her to undergo a corrective surgery.She explained: 'I was terrified of that, but he was like, \"I will be in the room with you.\" He held my hands through it and helped me build back my confidence.'As far as getting back her confidence on the big screen, Chopra credited Bollywood director Anil Sharma for helping her assuredly get back in front of the camera.She explained: 'I was supposed to play this lead, and I was shifted to a supporting character. That filmmaker was very kind. He, while the tide was against me, said, \"It will be a small part but give it your all.\" And I did.'Chopra went into more detail about the botched surgery and aftermath in her autobiography - titled Unfinished - which was released in February 2021.",

Unfortunately, it wasn't,' she wrote in her book.\u00a0",

        "The bad surgery lost her work - she says in the book she was fired from two movies. 'All the talk of body parts and skin tone collectively made me feel devalued and unseen and uncertain about my future,' said the Baywatch star.\u00a0'Having experienced the aftermath of a supposedly simple polyp removal, I knew I wasn't willing to follow the course he'd laid out for me, even if he, as the highly successful expert, was right,' she added.'\u2026 My difference is my strength. If I looked like other \"classically beautiful\" girls, then I wouldn't stand out, and more important, I wouldn't be me.'Priyanka had 'several corrective surgeries' and has now 'gotten accustomed to this face.'"
