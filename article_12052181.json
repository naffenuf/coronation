Just like, \"Oh my God, mom, were you really going to kill your brother?\"'\u00a0",
        "Along with being a fan of his mother's projects, Christina also gushed how he enjoys being an older brother to his 16-month-old sister, Cleo. 'She's really sweet. She's obsessed with her older brother, too. She chases him all over the house.'\u00a0In the past, the beauty has opened up about becoming a mother and expressed during an interview with Net-A-Porter's The Edit, per People, that, 'Marriage shows you your flaws in how you deal with things, and having a child forces you to grow up at the speed of light.'\u00a0",
        "She further added to the outlet that, 'I'm a completely different person\u00a0than I was before I had my child.'\u00a0While talking to Jennifer Hudson on Friday, Christina also proudly revealed that she would soon welcome a new addition into their family.\u00a0'We are getting a kitten,' Ricci announced, adding, 'I'm really excited about this.' The star revealed that her 'dream cat' was a Maine Coon, which is the largest cat breed and stated 'they are dog-sized cats!'\u00a0'I mean, can you imagine how great it would be to cuddle a dog-sized cat.' After Jennifer gave a rather concerned reaction, she added, 'I mean, you'd want to make sure it was a nice cat because a cat that size would be dangerous if there was something wrong.'\u00a0On the show's main Instagram page, a video of the interview was also shared along with the caption of, '@riccigrams is definitely a cool mom.'\u00a0Christina, who stunned in an elegant green dress, also shared a cute photo of herself posing with Jennifer on set of the talk show, and excitedly penned, 'I\u2019m on @jenniferhudsonshow\u00a0today!

        "The star, who turned heads in a figure-hugging, silver gown at the MET Gala earlier Monday in NYC, recently revealed that becoming a child star had made her 'obnoxious' during a new interview on the Reign With John Smith podcast.\u00a0",
        "While landing bigger roles in her 40s, she admits she didn't cope with the glaring spotlight in the best way when she was a child actor.\u00a0'Some people deal better with fame than other people and some people have more supportive families than other people,' she says. 'And I do think that having a \"famous child\" is a weird pressure to put on a child.'\u00a0'I think it's - and I always thought this when I was younger - when being asked questions about who I was before I knew who I was, I knew that that was not helpful as a kid, which is probably why I was so obnoxious in interviews all the time\u2026''I find it interesting because anytime I do work with someone who has been a child actor, they are the most professional people on set.'\u00a0'They are the people that understand the sacrifices that are going to have to be made. They're always the most prepared, they're always the most adaptable, as far as working with them.'",
        "Christina says having to audition when she was just seven helped her deal with rejection and she deals with it better in her professional career than in her personal life.'I think professionally I'm actually very good at being rejected,' she says. 'I mean, you might be p****d off for an afternoon or a day, but I've never been somebody who lets it destroy me.",
        "'I feel like real life, your personal life is so much more difficult. My personal life is more difficult and requires a lot more of my focus and I emotionally react to it more than my professional life.'Christina finalized her divorce from film producer James Heerdegen in December of last year, two years after their bitter split. She tied the knot with hairstylist, Mark Hampton, in 2021.\u00a0"
