        "KANSAS CITY, Kan. -- Racing in the Indianapolis 500 has long been a dream of Hendrick Motorsports driver Kyle Larson.",
        "Earlier this week, Larson took the first concrete step toward making that dream a reality. On a visit to the Arrow McLaren race shop in Indianapolis, Larson was fitted for the seat he will occupy during the 2024 running of the race.The driver of the No. 5 Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet already has made his mark in a wide variety of racing equipment. Among his accomplishments are winning the 2021 NASCAR Cup Series championship, the Chili Bowl Midget Nationals, and the Knoxville Nationals and Kings Royal for winged sprint cars.Tony Kanaan, the 2013 Indy 500 champion and Larson's teammate on the winning 2015 Rolex 24 Hours of Daytona team, also attended the fitting.\"I know we will have a shot to win,\" Larson said in a Hendrick Motorsports release. \"This is definitely winning equipment. It's going to be a fun experience. Want to soak it all in and try to do the best job we can come a year from now.\"Larson plans to race in the 2024 Indy 500 and Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte Motor Speedway on the same day. He would become the fifth driver to run that double, joining John Andretti, Tony Stewart, Robby Gordon and Kurt Busch.--Field Level Media"
