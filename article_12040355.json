        "Sanctions are set to be issued against six former Yorkshire players later today for using racist language.",
        "An independent Cricket Discipline Commission panel found five individuals \u2013 John Blain, Tim Bresnan, Andrew Gale, Matthew Hoggard and Richard Pyrah \u2013 had used the term \u201cP***\u201d about former Yorkshire team-mate Azeem Rafiq or other people of Asian ethnicity when it issued its decision in the case on March 31.A sixth individual \u2013 Gary Ballance \u2013 had already admitted using racist and/or discriminatory language and is expected to be sanctioned at the same hearing on Wednesday.",
        "The panel will consider any written submissions or verbal representations from or on behalf of the six before deciding on any sanctions, but the PA news agency understands a written submission had only been received on behalf of Ballance as of Tuesday afternoon.The other five individuals had withdrawn from the proceedings and did not appear at a liability hearing held in early March, with the charges against them heard in their absence.Among the panel\u2019s sanctioning powers are the imposition of suspensions and fines, and ordering an education or training course be completed.The CDC panel cleared former England captain Michael Vaughan of using racist and/or discriminatory language.Yorkshire admitted four charges in the case, which stemmed primarily from allegations made by Rafiq and the club\u2019s handling of the claims.",
        "A separate hearing will deal with the sanctions the club will face on June 27.",
        "Former England international Hoggard was found to have used the term \u201cP***\u201d towards Rafiq and other Asian players during the 2008 season, and the term \u201cRafa the Kaffir\u201d towards Rafiq.It also found he had used the term \u201ctoken black man\u201d or \u201cTBM\u201d towards former Yorkshire team-mate Ismail Dawood, and dismissed Hoggard\u2019s assertion that Dawood had created the nickname himself.Gale, a former Yorkshire captain and head coach, was also found to have used the term \u201cRafa the Kaffir\u201d towards Rafiq and the term \u201cP***\u201d towards Rafiq and Yorkshire academy player Mosun Hussain.Blain was found to have used the term \u201cP***\u201d in 2010 and/or 2011 while at Yorkshire, while Bresnan and Pyrah were found to have used the term \u201cfit P***\u201d or \u201cFP\u201d about Asian women."
