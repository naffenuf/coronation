        "So entwined has his life been with that of the Royal Family that his earliest memory is of being brought in to see Queen Elizabeth when she visited his parents\u2019 house in the late 1950s. She had, by then, already cradled him in her arms \u2013 not least at his christening, at which she became his godmother.",
        "Yet I can reveal that, despite this intimate bond \u2013 so intimate that he attended the Committal Service at Windsor, when Her Majesty was laid to rest in St George\u2019s Chapel \u2013 the Earl of Carnarvon will not be at Westminster Abbey on Saturday.Instead, \u2018Geordie\u2019, as the Queen always called him, and his wife, Fiona, will watch proceedings from afar, most probably at Highclere Castle, the spellbinding family seat which achieved global renown after the hit ITV drama Downton Abbey was filmed there.\u2018We will be watching it,\u2019 the Countess declares of the service. \u2018We are not there \u2013 new king, new way of doings things,\u2019 she explains, adding that such innovations are \u2018the right thing to do\u2019.That diplomatic flourish cannot disguise the fact that the couple\u2019s absence from the Coronation represents an even more startling divergence from the old order than the exclusion of most of the dukes and lesser members of the aristocracy.",
        "This is not so much because generations of Carnarvons have attended innumerable previous coronations nor even because, aged 13, Geordie was the Queen\u2019s Page of Honour, holding her train at the State Opening of Parliament in 1970. It is, instead, because of the longstanding and profound personal friendship between the two families as embodied in the bond between Geordie\u2019s father, \u2018Porchey\u2019 Carnarvon, the 7th Earl, who died in 2001, and the Queen.",
        "His sudden death aged 77 was a shattering blow to the monarch. It came on the same day as the September 11 terrorist attack on New York\u2019s World Trade Centre and many saw a personal touch in the emotional message she sent to be read at a service of remembrance.\u2018Nothing that can be said can begin to take away the anguish and the pain of these moments,\u2019 she wrote. \u2018Grief is the price we pay for love.\u2019As a young officer in the Blues, Porchey was one of the friends who, as Geordie, 66, told the Daily Mail last year, \u2018ran around London on VE Day with [the then Princess Elizabeth] and Princess Margaret incognito...There were about 12 of them. Took off and conga-ed.\u2019In the years that followed, Porchey became not only Queen Elizabeth\u2019s racing manager \u2013 a role he fulfilled for more than 30 years \u2013 but her confidant, to whom she would speak by telephone or in person at Sandringham, Windsor or Balmoral, where the two families holidayed together. Numerous photographs of those carefree times are contained in the Carnarvons\u2019 family albums.There will be no such intimate moments on Saturday. But, as they watch proceedings on television, the Earl and Countess may well spy one very familiar figure \u2013 Geordie\u2019s erstwhile sister-in-law, Chica, who was married to his younger brother, Harry, until 2018. Since then, Harry has re-married, his new wife being acclaimed chef Clodagh McKenna; so, too, as I disclosed in December, has the vivacious Chica. Her new husband is the Duke of Norfolk \u2013 who, in his role as Earl Marshal, arranges every detail of the Coronation...",

        "The Crown star Natascha McElhone is determined to put on a glittering performance even when the cameras have stopped rolling.The actress, who played Prince Philip\u2019s confidante Countess Mountbatten of Burma in the hit Netflix drama, was seen wearing a pair of Ugg\u2019s \u00a395 Drizlita Glitter Boots on a shopping trip in North London. She completed the look with a flowing dress and two floral bags.McElhone, 51, said she was drawn to playing the Countess, Penny Knatchbull, in The Crown because of the uniqueness of \u2018putting on screen a relationship between a man and a woman where perhaps it\u2019s a ferocious friendship, and there isn\u2019t a romantic element\u2019.BBC star Alex\u2019s hair-raising review\u00a0The One Show\u2019s Alex Jones did not get a good review from her mother for her latest BBC TV series, Reunion Hotel.The presenter reveals: \u2018My mother said, \u201cIt\u2019s a shame you didn\u2019t think to do your hair before you started filming\u201d.\u2019Jones, 46, concedes her hair could have done with a bit of colour in it but offered a defence.

        "\u2018My ma wanted me to post this when I showed her my pics from Sardinia,\u2019 says the actress (right), whose daughter, Daisy Bevan, is 31.\u2018I have a very vivid memory of her doing cartwheels round the garden on my daughter\u2019s first birthday.
