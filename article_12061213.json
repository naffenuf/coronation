        "Survey shows 2.5% of households missed or defaulted on a housing paymentMissed payments high among renters with 1 in 20 missing payment last monthAn estimated 700,000 households across the UK missed rent or mortgage payments in April, according to Which?",
        "The consumer group based the calculation on a survey of 2,000 people by Yonder, which indicated that around 2.5 per cent of households had missed or defaulted on a housing payment in the previous month.Missed housing payments were particularly high among renters - with around one in 20 (5.2 per cent) renters surveyed missing a payment in the past month.Nearly six in 10 (59 per cent) people reported making at least one adjustment to cover essential spending such as utility bills, housing costs, groceries, school supplies and medicines in the past month.Adjustments included cutting back on essentials, dipping into savings, selling possessions or borrowing.",
        "Rocio Concha, Which? director of policy and advocacy, said: 'It's very worrying that so many households are missing housing payments.'We'd encourage anyone who's struggling to seek free debt advice and reach out to their mortgage provider or landlord for help.'As so many people face financial hardship, Which? is calling on businesses in essential sectors like food, energy and telecoms providers to do more to help customers get a good deal and avoid unnecessary or unfair costs and charges during this crisis.'",
