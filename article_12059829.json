        "Northampton manager Jon Brady dedicated his side\u2019s League Two promotion to the supporters following a battling 1-0 win at Tranmere.",
        "A fantastic strike from Sam Hoskins was the difference between the two sides as the Cobblers avoided another final-day heartbreak having missed out on goals scored 12 months ago following Bristol Rovers\u2019 7-0 victory.Hoskins blasted home his 22nd goal of the season from 18 yards in the fifth minute after Tranmere failed to clear the danger from a corner, sending the 2,000 travelling fans wild with delight.Rovers had chances of their own and were keen to prove they weren\u2019t going to roll over for the side who had League One football next season in their sights, with Jay Turner-Cooke and Sam Taylor coming close to levelling after the break.Town went in search of a second goal which would have made the closing stages slightly less agonising, though Shaun McWilliams and Louis Appere were unable to convert as the tension mounted.But Hoskins\u2019 early strike ultimately proved to be enough for Brady\u2019s side, who would have been promoted anyway due to Stockport\u2019s draw with Hartlepool, as Northampton return to the third tier of English football for the first time since being relegated in 2021.",
        "Brady said: \u201cIt\u2019s just incredible. It\u2019s been very, very hard to get to this position but it\u2019s an incredible story really.\u201cConsidering what\u2019s happened in the time I\u2019ve been here, especially what happened last year when Scunthorpe fielded a youth team (against Bristol Rovers) and it wasn\u2019t right, we had to grit our teeth and go again.",
        "\u201cThis kind of thing doesn\u2019t usually happen to us and we were pushed right to the very end, it would certainly be a good book to write.\u201cI\u2019m pleased for everyone in the town, I\u2019m pleased for our chairman, all the staff, the players and the fans ultimately.\u201cThey\u2019ve been through a bit of torture at times and against all odds with only really half a team out we\u2019ve done it and it is an unbelievable achievement.\u201cThe fans at our end took the roof off, they roared the boys home until the end. I\u2019m just glad we could get over the line for them.\u201dTranmere manager Ian Dawes said: \u201cI can\u2019t fault the players\u2019 efforts and how they approached the game.\u201cThe preparation was right, we looked okay tactically but in the first half there wasn\u2019t quite enough of a spark or tempo which we addressed at half time.\u201cThe second half we were much better and played forward more and created some good opportunities.\u201cI hate getting beaten as Tranmere manager and for me now I\u2019ve got to look at the bigger picture.\u201cI look at Northampton today and they\u2019ve been promoted and I\u2019m thinking we\u2019re not too far away from them.\u201cI\u2019m looking at it and thinking \u2018if we\u2019re going to get to where they are then we know what\u2019s needed in the summer, it\u2019s just up to us to address it\u2019.",
        "\u201cI can\u2019t fault the lads\u2019 effort and endeavour and it certainly wasn\u2019t for the lack of effort today, but our management team and everyone around us is focused on getting the right players in.\u201d"
