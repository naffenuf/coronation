        "His ex-wife Gisele Bundchen attended her first Met Gala since their divorce last night.",
        "But Tom Brady managed to tune out the festivities as he focused on his golf swing thousands of miles away.The football legend, 45, finalized his divorce from Bundchen, 42, in late 2022, and Monday night's gala marked the first time she had attended the exclusive bash without him since 2007. The last time she was a guest was with Brady in 2019.As the fashionable festivities unfolded in New York on Monday, Brady was seen playing a round with a pal at the Riviera Country Club in Los Angeles that same day.The former football pro wore a pale grey zip-up, black slacks, and white sneakers for his day on the course.",
        "Whatever emotions he was feeling that day, he managed to conceal them as he worked on his swing.With a gloved hand, Tom prepared to strike the golf ball with his club, looking deep in concentration.He was pictured striking the ball in a different location, and watched it soar alongside his friend who smiled in approval.It seems the nostalgic event across the country did little to impact Brady's mood. Overall, the football player seemed deeply engrossed in his golf technique.\u00a0Gisele attended the Met Gala for the first time on her own since 2007 on Monday evening. She looked heavenly a stunning white ensemble from the Chanel archive, according to Vogue.",
        "Brady was still just her boyfriend when they attended the event for the first time together back in 2008.\u00a0The latest sighting comes weeks after she admitted she still loved her former spouse but that they'd simply 'grown apart' after 13 years of marriage and two children together.Gisele and the NFL superstar announced in October 2022 that they had decided 'amicably' to divorce and that they did so after 'much consideration.'\u00a0",
        "It was filed and finalized on October 28.'We are blessed with beautiful and wonderful children who will continue to be the center of our world in every way. We will continue to work together as parents to always ensure they receive the love and attention they deserve,' the Super Bowl champ wrote on Instagram.In her own statement, the runway maven also put an emphasis on their children's wellbeing and that they've both vowed to 'give them the love, care and attention they greatly deserve.'She also expressed gratitude for the time her and Tom spent together as a married couple.",
        "'The decision to end a marriage is never easy but we have grown apart and while it is, of course, difficult to go through something like this, I feel blessed for the time we had together and only wish the best for Tom always,' Gisele concluded.",
        "It came after months of rumors that the pair's relationship had turned rocky following Tom's decision to un-retire from football just 40 days after announcing he would be leaving his NFL career behind.He officially retired from the sport - which earned him seven Super Bowl rings after playing for 23 season - in February 2023.In a March interview with Vanity Fair, Gisele refuted claims that she gave the football pro an ultimatum forcing him to choose their relationship over his sporting career.She said she found the rumors 'very hurtful' and insisted that she has only ever 'wanted all his dreams to come true.'The couple co-parent son Benjamin, 13, and daughter Vivian, 10. Tom also shares 15-year-old son John Edward with ex Bridget Moynahan, 52.\u00a0"
