        "The boy was given a 30-month youth rehabilitation order this afternoonThe court heard that he attempted to rape two of the victims\u00a0A 13-year-old schoolboy sexually assaulted four victims on four afternoons while walking home from school - attempting to rape two of them.",
        "A court today heard the youth, the son of a police officer, was wearing his school uniform when he approached his first two victims on a tree-lined and secluded footpath as they walked home from a college.The court heard a third victim was also attacked on the same footpath while a fourth was assaulted on a separate footpath in Telford, Shropshire.The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was given a 30-month youth rehabilitation order this afternoon, after a judge ruled it would allow him to continue receiving \u2018therapeutic\u2019 treatment to address his behaviour.Prosecutor Alex Warren said the boy attempted to rape two of the victims \u2013 telling one that \u2018everyone has sex\u2019. Three of his victims were teenagers.\u00a0",
        "Mr Warren said the first victim, aged 17, was molested in December when the boy \u2018touched her breasts\u2019 after encountering her listening to music on headphones as she walked alone.\u2018It was beginning to get dark and he was walking in the opposite direction\u2019, the barrister said. \u2018He stretched out and grabbed her breasts.\u2019\u00a0The woman started to run away but the boy \u2018smiled crudely and walked off\u2019, Shrewsbury Crown Court heard.But Mr Warren said the defendant then followed her, approached her and asked for a hug. He then began grappling with her, before leaving when a man appeared on a bicycle.",
        "The following three attacks took place on successive January days, in the same area of Telford, the court heard.In the first of these, the youth grabbed the breasts and bottom of a 16-year-old who was walking home from college alone, before pushing her to the floor and straddling her.The court heard the boy told the victim he wanted to have sex with her and that \u2018everyone has sex\u2019. He then tried to remove her hand which was protecting her belt buckle, before eventually running off.The next day he grabbed a woman\u2019s bottom from behind in an assault captured on CCTV, the youth\u2019s arms outstretched as he approached her.Mr Warren said the victim described her assailant as \u2018very confident\u2019 and described how he \u2018just walked away\u2019 when she took out her phone to try and take his picture.The boy later claimed to police that he had tripped on a shoelace and had stretched out his arms to break his fall.The boy was arrested following the fourth attack, on a 17-year-old girl as she walked home from college.\u00a0The court heard he passed her on a footpath before approaching from behind and grabbing her, before kissing her cheek.Mr Warren said the victim became scared as he was \u2018becoming rougher and more aggressive\u2019, eventually putting her in a headlock as he attempted to pull her leggings down.",
        "The victim eventually kicked him off and ran, but he chased her, holding her bag and earphones.The court heard the victim sought help from a passer-by, at which point the boy dropped her belongings and ran away. He denied attacking her and told police he was a Good Samaritan who had been attempting to return her belongings.In victim impact statements read out to the court, the victims said they had been left scared to walk on their own.One victim said she was now \u2018constantly checking behind me when I walk\u2019. Another said she had \u2018not walked to or from college since this happened\u2019, and now wore \u2018joggers or big jumpers\u2019, rather than the \u2018cute\u2019 outfits she favoured previously.The boy was convicted of seven sexual assaults and two attempted rapes at Kidderminster Youth Court last month.Jemma Gordon, defending, had urged the judge to impose a \u2018robust\u2019 youth rehabilitation order and pointed out the boy was \u2018particularly young\u2019 and had suffered an \u2018unstable upbringing with adverse childhood experiences to date\u2019.The court heard the boy claimed his offending was driven by anger and low mood, rather than for sexual gratification.Judge Anthony Lowe said the \u2018very, very difficult case\u2019 required him to strike a balance between \u2018what a 13-year-old boy needs and what society needs when women are accosted in the street for no good reason\u2019.\u00a0",
        "He said the rehabilitation order would carry a supervision requirement, and would allow the boy to receive treatment in a care setting in the hope of addressing his behaviour \u2018by the time he is approaching adulthood\u2019.The judge told the boy, who stood in the dock to be sentenced: \u2018You are old enough to understand that behaviour has consequences and what you did was very bad.\u2019\u00a0He told the boy he would have received a sentence of \u2018eight or nine years\u2019 if he was an adult for such offending, adding: \u2018You have to look inside your own head and try to work out what on earth made you behave in that way.\u2019The court heard the boy had no previous offences to his name.Detective Sergeant Chris Henry, of West Mercia Police, said: \u2018Thankfully attacks such as these are rare but women everywhere can take reassurance from the fact that we will not hesitate to act when they do.\u2019The judge said he had \u2018absolutely no idea what the driving force is behind these offences\u2019.He said was clear the boy had a \u2018distorted view about sexual intimacy and sexual relationships and a distorted view about women generally\u2019, but added: \u2018There is no explanation for why he has these distorted views or, more importantly, how they are going to be rehabilitated.\u2019"
