        "Plaid Cymru have apologised after a damning review found a culture of harassment, bullying and misogyny in the party.",
        "The report states the Welsh nationalist party had \u201cfailed to implement a zero-tolerance approach to sexual harassment\u201d and that women had been \u201cespecially\u201d let down.It also said \u201ctoo many instances of bad behaviour\u201d by elected members have been tolerated within the party so that staff felt \u201cthere is little point in raising concerns\u201d.A total of 82 recommendations have been made to \u201cdetoxify\u201d the party\u2019s culture. It is clear that there are instances - both historically and in more recent times - whereby unacceptable behaviour has been allowed to take place or go unchallenged  Plaid's Adam Price and Marc Jones  Plaid leader Adam Price said he was \u201cdeeply sorry\u201d and that all the recommendations would be taken on board.The party\u2019s National Executive Committee and Mr Price jointly commissioned the review, which was led by former Plaid politician Nerys Evans, and it began to look into the party\u2019s culture last December.",
        "One of the key findings of the Prosiect Pawb (Everyone\u2019s Project) report was that inherent power imbalances within the party \u201ccoupled with inaction over many years from those with positions of power to challenge bad behaviour, has made a bad situation even worse\u201d.It said that despite the party having a robust complaints procedure, it needed to develop a system to \u201cdeal with the distinct issue of sexual harassment in the workplace and within the membership\u201d.",
        "It added: \u201cThere is lack of faith and trust in the policies we do have in place due to historic issues of inconsistencies in how our policies and procedures have been implemented which has exacerbated the situation.\u201dEvidence from an anonymous staff survey and elected members \u201chighlight cases of sexual harassment, bullying and discrimination\u201d, the report said, claiming: \u201cThese are not isolated cases.\u201d It is clear that we must do better if we are to foster a culture which is safe, inclusive and respectful to all  Plaid's Adam Price and Marc Jones  The survey also found most discrimination was gender-based, it said.The report concluded that Plaid\u2019s governing body \u201cmust be confident actions taken in the light of Prosiect Pawb\u2019s findings and recommendations will be effective in enabling permanent, non-reversible measures to detoxify a culture of harassment, bullying and misogyny and to make Plaid truly and visibly welcoming to women\u201d.In a joint statement, Mr Price and Plaid chairman Marc Jones said: \u201cIt is clear that there are instances \u2013 both historically and in more recent times \u2013 whereby unacceptable behaviour has been allowed to take place or go unchallenged and that our processes and governance arrangements have been inadequate to address this.\u201cIndividuals have been let down as a result \u2013 women especially, but also men.",
        "\u201cFor that, on behalf of the collective leadership of Plaid Cymru, we are deeply sorry.\u201cIt is clear that we must do better if we are to foster a culture which is safe, inclusive and respectful to all. That is how we will regain the trust of colleagues and members.\u201d"
