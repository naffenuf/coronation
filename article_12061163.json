        "Celtic defender Greg Taylor admits it was an amazing feeling to deliver the title in style but neither he nor his team-mates will sit back and reflect.",
        "Taylor is determined to push on and improve after wrapping up back-to-back cinch Premiership crowns with victory over Hearts on Sunday.A record Scottish top-flight points tally of 107 is in Celtic\u2019s sights if they win their last four games and then they have a shot at the treble when they face Inverness in the Scottish Cup final.Taylor said: \u201cIt\u2019s a club that demands trophies, demands success and to deliver it playing a brand of football the way we do is amazing.\u201cWe have not rested on what we did last year at all. We knew there was more in us and there is still more to come.\u201cWe want to improve going into next season but most importantly we want to finish this season strongly first. We have got four league games and a cup final so we have more to look forward to.",
        "\u201cWe are all so driven and keen for success and we believe every last word the gaffer says to us is going to help us and stand us in good stead.\u201cIt\u2019s been a really successful season thus far but there is still more to come.\u201dManager Ange Postecoglou praised his players for their self-motivation after their title triumph and Taylor feels the collective attitude is special.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s something you have got to appreciate because it doesn\u2019t come easy to have that amount of boys that are so keen for success and keen to improve their game,\u201d the 25-year-old said.\u201cThey want of course to improve and wherever they end up. But right now, in the here and now for Celtic, every player in that changing room loves it, and long may it continue.\u201cThere is such a strong belief. We don\u2019t waste any training session, any game.\u201dThe former Kilmarnock left-back has produced his best football this season.\u201cI hope so because I aim to improve as I go along,\u201d he said. \u201cThus far it\u2019s been my best level but hopefully there\u2019s more to come from myself as well.\u201cIt\u2019s just a small part in a collective. The real reason we have been so successful this year is the collective.\u201cEveryone has played their part, 20-25 boys have all contributed throughout the season, so real credit to the whole group.\u201d"
