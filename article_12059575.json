        "Rishi Sunak has promised to work \u201cnight and day\u201d to deliver, as he comes under pressure over the Conservatives\u2019 dire performance in the local elections and critics turn on a failure to build sufficient houses.",
        "The Prime Minister was on Monday trying to move on from the defeats that saw nearly 1,000 Tory councillors lose their jobs, as voters turned last week to Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Greens.As the post-mortem was under way, former levelling up secretary Simon Clarke said Mr Sunak\u2019s \u201cmajor mistake\u201d of dropping housebuilding had played a role in the poor performance.",
        "Labour was considering putting higher taxes on foreign buyers of UK homes as the party seeks to pressure the Government on the housing crisis.The Opposition was understood to be adapting policy to increase the 2% surcharge on stamp duty for overseas buyers and banning them purchasing more than 50% of homes in a development.They could also introduce a rule allowing first-time buyers first access to new developments if Sir Keir Starmer forms a government.Mr Sunak declined to apologise to the hundreds of Tory councillors who had lost their jobs when asked, after volunteering at a lunch club in Hertfordshire as part of the coronation initiative.",
        "Instead, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s always disappointing to lose hard-working Conservative councillors and I said that at the time.\u201dThe Prime Minister insisted that delivering on his five priorities, which include cutting NHS waiting lists which he is announcing policies on this week, is what the public wants.",
        "\u201cI know that\u2019s not going to happen overnight but we\u2019re going to strain every sinew to do exactly that,\u201d he said.\u201cI believe those are the country\u2019s priorities, those are my priorities and I\u2019m going to work night and day to deliver on them for everyone.\u201dMr Clarke argued that the Government\u2019s attempts to \u201cpander to the public\u2019s worst instincts\u201d of Nimbyism \u2013 wanting building but \u201cnot in my backyard\u201d \u2013 was failing. In these results, there is one theme that stands out above all others for me is that we cannot out-Nimby the Liberal Democrats and the Greens, so one aspect of policy that does need to change and change as a matter of urgency is our housing policy  Former levelling up secretary Simon Clarke  The Senior Tory MP, who served in Liz Truss\u2019s chaotic and brief government, conceded the tumult of last year was behind the electoral failings as well as current policy.But he urged colleagues not to be \u201craking over the coals of what happened\u201d under past administrations and to instead focus on the present.Mr Clarke told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cIn these results, there is one theme that stands out above all others for me is that we cannot out-Nimby the Liberal Democrats and the Greens, so one aspect of policy that does need to change and change as a matter of urgency is our housing policy.",
        "\u201cSo we can get back to building the homes that people need, making the case, the moral, economic, political case, for building the homes that a growing population requires rather than, I\u2019m afraid, trying to pander to the public\u2019s worst instincts on this question, which isn\u2019t working.\u201cI would say that dropping those targets was a major mistake and I would like those restored.\u201d The point is that we\u2019ve lost huge swathes of councillors in the South East while having dropped targets and having run away from this argument, so it\u2019s not rewarding us in the South East, it\u2019s actually hurting us  Former levelling up secretary Simon Clarke  He also said there was a need to give more resources to council planning departments, to look at incentives for new infrastructure and to take on the \u201chollowness\u201d of the Nimby position.Last year, Mr Sunak caved in to pressure from Tory backbenchers to make the target of building 300,000 houses a year in England advisory rather than mandatory and has argued there is little support for \u201ctop-down targets\u201d.Some argue that while housebuilding may be needed to increase the chances of holding on to the northern voters won over by Boris Johnson, it will be damaging to the Tories\u2019 chances in their more traditional southern heartlands.",
        "But Mr Clarke said: \u201cThe point is that we\u2019ve lost huge swathes of councillors in the South East while having dropped targets and having run away from this argument, so it\u2019s not rewarding us in the South East, it\u2019s actually hurting us.\u201dThe Tories shed 960 councillors across England in Thursday\u2019s elections in a result approaching the party\u2019s most pessimistic predictions. The local elections showed that the public clearly has no confidence in Sunak or the Conservatives, so it\u2019s time for a general election now  Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey  Labour gained 635 seats and won control of 22 councils, and the Liberal Democrats also performed strongly.Meanwhile, the Lib Dems hope to add to the pressure on Mr Sunak by tabling a motion of no confidence in his Government in the Commons as soon as Tuesday.The Prime Minister would be highly likely to win if it reached a vote because he commands a large majority in the House.Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said: \u201cThe local elections showed that the public clearly has no confidence in Sunak or the Conservatives, so it\u2019s time for a general election now.\u201cThere\u2019s only one reason Rishi Sunak would deny British people a say at the ballot box: because he is running scared and knows he\u2019d lose.\u201d"
