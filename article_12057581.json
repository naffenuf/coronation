        "Leicester boss Dean Smith says his players know it is important to avoid relegation in order to protect their legacy at the club.",
        "The majority of the Foxes squad have been involved in one of the club\u2019s most successful periods over the last few years, with an FA Cup success and back-to-back fifth-placed finishes under Brendan Rodgers.Things have been different this season, with the club firmly embroiled in a relegation fight where they are currently out of the bottom three on goal difference alone ahead of Monday\u2019s visit to Fulham.Smith, who was parachuted in last month on an SOS mission to keep the Foxes up after Rodgers was sacked, has seen that his players care.\u201cIt is, that\u2019s the important thing I\u2019ve felt from the players,\u201d he said when asked how crucial it was to protect the players\u2019 recent achievements by staying up.\u201cThe care for the club and the need to ensure it remains a Premier League team, not just from us as coaching staff but also from the players, has been really noticeable.",
        "\u201cYou can see that in the performances as well.\u201dLeicester have been hamstrung by poor defensive displays, having not kept a clean sheet in 19 games, going back to the 2-0 win at West Ham in the final game before the World Cup break.Smith reckons if they can get that right between now and the end of the season, they will stay up.",
        "\u201cIf we keep four clean sheets until the end of the season, we\u2019re safe. I fully believe we\u2019ve got players that can score goals, so we would win some of those games,\u201d he said.Smith brought John Terry with him to the King Power Stadium and says the former England and Chelsea centre-back can play a part in shoring up the defence.He added: \u201cHe is someone they listen to because he based his game on being a good defender first and a good footballer second.\u201cHe gives little tips he had and talks about the \u2018what if\u2019 quite a lot.\u201cAs a defender you have to think, \u2018What if he does make a mistake\u2019 so you are there to cover him.\u201d"
