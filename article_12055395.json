        "Hamilton went out in Q3 and will start Sunday's race from 13th placeSergio Perez took pole position after a dramatic qualifying session in MiamiCharles Leclerc crashed late on, leaving Max Verstappen down in ninth place\u00a0Toto Wolff was at a loss to explain the continued woes of the underperforming Mercedes, calling the car that carried Lewis Hamilton to a lowly 13th qualifying position for the Miami Grand Prix \u2018a nasty piece of work\u2019.",
        "The Silver Arrows boss is hoping an upgrade due in Imola on May 17 will deliver some significant improvement, but for now the mood at the once-dominant team is low.While Sergio Perez took pole for Red Bull, Hamilton\u2019s team-mate George Russell qualified sixth, nearly a second off the pace.A perplexed Wolff said: \u2018The car is a nasty piece of work. We have no comprehension of why. I take no joy in being sixth. It is unacceptable.\u2019Wolff, who is clearly trying to defend the underperformance of his star man Hamilton, said: \u2018There is not a lot to say to Lewis because the car is simply not fast enough. Putting him in a situation on his out lap where the driver is not able to prepare his tyres makes it even worse.",
        "\u2018We are not trying to make mistakes. We are trying to give them the best position, and we have in the past got it wrong many times, and also got it right many times. But if things go badly they compound the situation.\u2018The car is not a nice one, not a good car. There are problems everywhere, with the base performance and our lack of understanding of the car. The performance is just really bad.\u2018The car is not bouncing on the straight. That is the only thing that is better than last year. The car is not fast enough and we don\u2019t have any comprehension of why that is.\u2019"
