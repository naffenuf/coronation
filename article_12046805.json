        "Footage from question time in the SA parliament on Thursday shows Sport Minister Katrine Hildyard speaking about measures that will help girls and women to feel 'more confident and comfortable to participate when they have their period'.\u00a0But Government Minister Geoff Brock, who was seated behind Ms Hildyard, appeared visibly aghast at the mention of the word on the floor of parliament.\u00a0\u00a0After becoming startled, Mr Brock then took a quick look around the chamber and appeared to be uncomfortable at the raising of the issue.",
        "Ms Hildyard went on to say that the government funding has enabled sporting clubs to buy period products for women.\u00a0'So that's been another really, really good step forward which has been very well received by girls and women in sport,' she said.Mr Brock, who is the independent member for the seat of Stuart, declined to comment on the video when asked by The Advertiser.\u00a0Free sanitary products have available for female students who need them in all South Australian public schools since 2021.In January, students at public schools across New South Wales gained access to free pads and tampons after the\u00a0state government announced that more than 4600 dispensers had been installed in public schools across the state.'Getting your period should not be a barrier to education,' Education Minister Sarah Mitchell said at the time."
