        "Coronation Big Lunch organisers and guests have hailed the community spirit fostered on Sunday, with one describing such get togethers as \u201cessential\u201d.",
        "The coronation celebrations continued the day after the King was crowned, with thousands of people coming together to enjoy food, drink, games and music up and down the country.",
        "Prime Minister Rishi Sunak was joined by US First Lady Jill Biden at Downing Street\u2019s Big Lunch while the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh attended an event in Cranleigh, Surrey.But it was community organisers such as Kate Welch, a trustee of The Old Rectory, a grade II listed building in Houghton-le-Spring, Sunderland, who put the effort in to arrange local events for thousands to enjoy.\u201cThe whole idea for us is it\u2019s about bringing the community together,\u201d Ms Welch, 65, from Chester-le-Street, told the PA news agency.",
        "\u201cWe are a community that is in the old coalfields area, so it\u2019s an area where a lot of people don\u2019t have much money.\u201cA lot of people have struggled, Covid obviously came\u2026 so just being able to come out and share together \u2013 I\u2019ve been looking around, I can see children in pushchairs, I can see people in wheelchairs and mobility scooters.\u201dThousands of people were in attendance at Ms Welch\u2019s Big Lunch, enjoying circus skills, dinosaur hunts, hot dogs and a storytelling tent among other things.\u201cIt just lifts your heart doesn\u2019t it? It\u2019s amazing,\u201d she said.",
        "\u201cYou see the amount of red, white and blue out here, lots of people are definitely here to celebrate the coronation. Some people are here just to enjoy the fun \u2013 welcome to all of them.\u201cWhat\u2019s my favourite? Oh, I\u2019m watching kids blowing giant bubbles. They\u2019re in their waterproof suits, and they\u2019re just having a ball.\u201d It\u2019s an excuse to get people together, whatever your allegiances, however you vote, whatever you think  Sonia Hearld  Meanwhile, residents of Burn, near Selby, have been putting on a Big Lunch since 2009, making it one of the longest running events of its kind.The village\u2019s decorations include a life-size recreation of the Gold State Coach, complete with horses and cut-outs of the King and Queen.Neighbours gathered in a marquee outside the Wheatsheaf pub for a barbecue, royal-themed quizzes and a treasure hunt, with activities for children including royal hopscotch and a throne photo booth.Sonia Hearld, who started organising Burn\u2019s Big Lunch in 2009 in a bid to bring her rural community together and combat loneliness, said: \u201cWhatever you think about the royal family, I think it\u2019s just a great historic event, the like of which many of us will never see again.\u201cIt\u2019s an excuse to get people together, whatever your allegiances, however you vote, whatever you think, and as we all know from Covid, Zoom doesn\u2019t take the place of real interaction.\u201d",
        "Sheila Holmes, 79, attended the Coronation Big Lunch in Burn with her husband Gordon, 88, who served on the parish council for 43 years.Mrs Holmes said: \u201cIt\u2019s marvellous for such a small village to make such a supreme effort.\u201cI thought the service yesterday was beautiful. It\u2019s what we do best, being British.\u201dParish council chair Chris Phillipson said: \u201cI\u2019ve lived in the village all my life.\u201cWe used to have sports days but as the village got older and children got older and moved away, they stopped, so it\u2019s nice to resurrect some sort of community event.\u201d We've got kids who are 13 or 14 talking to different generations, when normally in the street they might not do that  Nick Pritchard  Nick Pritchard, 39, from Three Cocks in Wales, is the founder of Three Cocks Matters, which aims to bring the local community together after he noticed a lack of connection and communal space.With no community hall, their Big Lunch took place at the local school, with attendees aged from 19 months \u201cright up to 80s if not 90s\u201d, according to Mr Pritchard.\u201cI see it as essential (bringing people together),\u201d he added.\u201cTo have events is essential because it\u2019s just giving an opportunity to get people around the table \u2013 that whole \u2018knowing your neighbour\u2019 situation has definitely been lost over the last 20-30 years.",
        "\u201cPost-Covid people have really started to realise how important that community connection is.\u201cWe\u2019ve got kids who are 13 or 14 talking to different generations, when normally in the street they might not do that.\u201dJudith Taylor, 69, from Brighton, started a movement in her area to help people look after and maintain their local spaces, some of which were used to host their Big Lunch event.\u201cIt\u2019s just amazing. It is a bit of a proud moment,\u201d she said.\u201cIn this community we all live in flats for a start, so we don\u2019t have our own gardens.\u201cWhen you have flats you tend to have very small families, people living on their own, older people, so it\u2019s so important for them.\u201cIt is a bit of an excuse to come together but I would say probably two thirds of people out there are waving their union flags.\u201d"
