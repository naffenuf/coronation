        "Value of some used SUVs and city cars has jumped by almost 30% since 2021The biggest price fallers are electric cars, with Tesla Model 3 and VW e-Golf\u00a0More than half UK car owners think cars always go down in value\u00a0The value of some used SUVs and city cars has jumped by almost 30 per cent over the last two years thanks to a\u00a0combination of high demand and low stock.",
        "Research by second-hand sales platform Motorway also found that cars that can be used for trade, such as vans and private hire vehicles, are in high demand with dealers and can get great prices when sold in fair condition with relatively low miles throughout their lifespan.But despite average used car prices continuing to rocket, the value of some models has plummeted by more than a quarter in the last twelve months.The biggest price fallers are electric cars, as a combination of factors has dragged down EV valuations, including rising stock of used vehicles, increased supply of showroom-fresh cars and salary sacrifice tax break incentives to buy new.We reveal the list of risers and fallers below.\u00a0",
        "If you are selling your car, you will usually get the best price by doing so privately.Many people are put off doing this as they don't want the hassle of advertising it, or to deal with potential buyers, but a little effort can earn you a lot more.The typical alternative has been to part exchange a car when you get a new one, but this will often lead to the dealer offering you a low price - particularly as they may not actively want your old car.Quick sale services are likely to get you the lowest offer - although can compete with part exchange depending on the car.Another option is to find a dealer who actually wants your car.\u00a0Motorway's service allows car sellers to get dealers to compete to offer them the best price.\u00a0&gt; Check how much your car is worth with Motorway's value finder*This is Money has a commercial partnership with Motorway and will earn a small commission if you use it to sell your car.

        "Prestige cars, ranging from the big powerful BMW 8 Series, to Audi's E-Tron electric SUV have also depreciated sharply in the last year, with Motorway putting that down to the fact 'they can be\u00a0much more expensive to maintain than cheaper options'.It added: 'Not to mention that these aspirational models are upgraded and redesigned every few years, leaving the existing car stock on the road downgraded to \"runout\" status,' it added.Electric city cars previously in high demand, including the BMW i3 and Renault Zoe have dropped in price too.\u00a0However, used petrol city cars like the Vauxhall Corsa or Citroen C1 have appreciated in value over the past couple of years, mostly because they tend to represent low mileage for age as they might have been used for making short, local trips.'City cars from trustworthy, but not overly expensive brands, can hold their value very well compared to larger, more luxury cars,' Motorway added.Its research also shows that many motorists do not track the value of their cars and might not be aware they could be\u00a0raking in much more than anticipated from selling them.\u00a0Nearly one-third of Londoners plan to sell their vehicle in the next six months because of costs associated with the confirmed ULEZ expansion alongside the rising cost of living.\u00a0",
        "But more than two fifths, or 41 per cent, of car owners have no idea how much their car is worth, while a further 52 per cent think cars always go down in value.\u00a0Motorway's new data unveils that this isn't always the case, listing the best and worst cars you can have for resale value.\u00a0Top 5 used cars with the biggest price increasesVauxhall Corsa\u00a0Up by 14% from 2021 to 2022, then 16% from 2022 to 2023\u00a0",

        "Every car depreciates at a different rate, and it's hard to predict what will happen long term, with a variety of factors and buyer sentiment coming into play.'Age, mileage, and condition are the three most commonly-quoted factors used to appraise a car's value, before looking at real-time prices being fetched in the used-car market,' Motorway says.'The typical annual mileage for most UK drivers is around 8,000 miles, and most cars are ready for the scrap heap by 150,000 miles.\u00a0'Condition slips with age thanks to wear and tear as well as accidental damage.\u00a0'For some cars, external factors such as market conditions can end up having as strong an effect on value than the age/mileage/condition matrix.'In fact, in 2021, shortages in new cars meant that many used cars temporarily increased in value \u2013 some, quite significantly.\u00a0'In order to stay on top of your car's value, and remain aware of how it changes over time, it's imperative to track the depreciation rate.'How to avoid car depreciation?\u00a0'There's no real way to affect the benchmarked value that your make and model represents in the automotive market,' says Motorway.'However, you can control the condition and mileage of your car in order to get the best price within your car's normal range.\u00a0'Even if your model typically loses a lot of value, you can present a \"best in class\" unit by taking good care of it, and the price you fetch will reflect that.'Motorway allows you to track the value of up to six-passenger vehicles for free, with 'Car Value Tracker' tool, which\u00a0uses real-time sales data from Motorway's marketplace.&gt; Check how much your car is worth at Motorway**This is Money has a commercial partnership with Motorway and will earn a small commission if you use it to sell your car.
