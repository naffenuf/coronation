        "Duclair sprung Verhaeghe later in the shift and he put the Panthers up 3-2.KRAKEN 5-4 STARS\u00a0Yanni Gourde scored 12:17 into overtime and the Seattle Kraken beat Dallas 5-4 in Game 1 of their second-round series Tuesday night, even as Joe Pavelski scored all four Stars goal in his return to their lineup.Pavelski, at 38 years and 295 days old, became the oldest player ever with a four-goal game in the NHL playoffs.
