        "MILAN, May 6 (Reuters) - An early goal by Ismael Bennacer and a Theo Hernandez stunner gave AC Milan a much-needed 2-0 home win over Lazio in Serie A on Saturday, sending Stefano Pioli's side provisionally back into the top four.",
        "Milan moved up two places to fourth on 61 points, one ahead of fifth-placed Inter Milan and three more than Atalanta in sixth who both have a game in hand. Lazio stayed second and have a one-point advantage over Juventus.Last season's champions took the lead in the 17th minute after Olivier Giroud took advantage of a Lazio defensive error to set up Bennacer inside the box for the midfielder to bundle the ball past goalkeeper Ivan Provedel.Hernandez delighted the San Siro crowd when he made it 2-0 with a superb shot from distance just before the half-hour mark.
