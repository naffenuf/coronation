        "FRANKFURT, May 3 (Reuters) - German engineering companies' order books shrank less in March than in previous months, the VDMA engineering association said on Wednesday, adding it was too early to speak of a turnaround. March orders were 6% lower compared with the same month last year, with domestic orders down 10% and foreign orders down 4%, according to the VDMA. \"March was the first month since September 2022 with a single-digit decline in orders,\" VDMA chief economist Ralph Wiechers said. \"That is a small ray of hope - although we are well aware that the large-scale plant business has helped somewhat with achieving this result.\" Wiechers added that despite the less severe decline now was not the time to talk of a trend reversal: \"It is definitely too early for that.\" For the first three months of 2023, orders were down 13% compared with the prior-year period. Wiechers said that while the VDMA had noticed some surprisingly positive economic signals in recent weeks, investors were still anxious in the light of muted global growth and high inflation.
