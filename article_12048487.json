        "Seasonal flowers from around the UK will adorn Westminster Abbey for the King\u2019s coronation, with arrangements of home-grown blooms and foliage that will bring \u201cgravitas\u201d to the occasion, the floral designer has said.",
        "Shane Connolly, from west Belfast, said his aim was to make the flowers \u201cincredibly personal\u201d to Charles and the Queen Consort as well as showing that UK-grown flowers can be used at an event of this size.",
        "Mr Connolly, who created the floral arrangements at Charles and Camilla\u2019s wedding in 2005 and the Prince and Princess of Wales\u2019s wedding in 2011, was at the abbey on Thursday morning for the arrival of the flowers and said he will be among six people installing the designs right up until early on Saturday morning.There will be more than 120 varieties of flowers, including lily of the valley and auriculas, which both appeared in Camilla\u2019s wedding bouquet, as well as hellebores which appeared in the King\u2019s buttonhole at his wedding and are a particular favourite of his.Boughs cut from flowering shrubs and trees from the five Royal Horticultural Society gardens will adorn the High Altar, including branches from the pair of Dawyck beech trees planted by the late Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip at RHS Wisley in 1978.",
        "From the Isle of Skye to the coast of Cornwall, and from the mountains of Snowdonia to Tobermore in Northern Ireland, the flowers have been grown by more than 80 members of Flowers from the Farm on farmland, allotments and cutting gardens across the four nations of the UK.",
        "Flowers from the Farm is a not-for-profit membership association championing more than 960 independent, artisan growers of local, seasonal British-cut flowers. When so many big events people go to are full of flowers that have been flown halfway around the world, this is British, this is grown in the soil of the kingdom  Shane Connolly  Mr Connolly, who has held a Royal Warrant of Appointment to Queen Elizabeth II and the former Prince of Wales, said: \u201cMy overall vision is that the flowers are one of the things that can reflect the real characters of the King and Queen in this whole thing, and so they\u2019re simple garden flowers that are British, seasonal, like they might cut themselves from their own gardens.\u201cSo I felt that that was really important. Maybe this and the music are the two things that really reflect their personality.\u201cSo that was my aim. I also felt that it should come from all four nations, that they should all be represented, including Northern Ireland.\u201dMr Connolly said he approached Flowers from the Farm and they said they would like to do it \u201cas our gift to the King and Queen\u201d.The floral designer, who champions sustainability in the flower industry, said: \u201cThat\u2019s actually what flowers are all about. It isn\u2019t about showing off. It\u2019s about a gift. So these flowers then became a gift to the King and Queen on coronation day.\u201d",
        "He described the work that has gone into the flowers as \u201cvery wholesome\u201d, adding: \u201cThat was my aim \u2013 to make it all incredibly personal to them, and also showing that you can use British-grown seasonal flowers on a scale of this coronation.\u201dWhile Charles and Camilla have approved all of the flowers, they did not make specific requests.\u201cI think they probably trust me enough now,\u201d Mr Connolly said, adding that they know the flowers are \u201cseasonal and beautiful\u201d.He said the flowers will showcase \u201cthe best of what\u2019s happening in Britain\u201d this season.Mr Connolly, who turned 60 this week, said cold weather has resulted in them having crab apples, azaleas and rhododendrons which they may not have had in a hot spring.\u201cSo I\u2019m thrilled that it was cold,\u201d he laughed.Asked if he approached the coronation differently to the two royal weddings, Mr Connolly said: \u201cThis isn\u2019t a wedding. And I feel that it had to have a bit of gravitas.",
        "\u201cAnd so the colours are more serious I think. And we very much were inspired by the Cosmati Pavement and the High Altar itself with its wonderful colours.\u201dHe said people can expect to see deep reds, sharp reds, earthy colours and fresh green \u2013 a colour scheme he described as \u201calmost a kind of stained glass window\u201d.",
        "Speaking about what thoughts he would like people to take away on the day, Mr Connolly said: \u201cThat\u2019s a really hard one. I\u2019m doing it for the King and Queen. If guests take away something I would love them to take away \u2018Wow. That was all grown in Britain, isn\u2019t that amazing?\u2019\u201cWhen so many big events people go to are full of flowers that have been flown halfway around the world, this is British, this is grown in the soil of the kingdom.\u201dMr Connolly said the abbey was so full of people for the Queen\u2019s coronation in 1953 that there was no place for flowers, and instead flowers were on the processional route and in an annexe.\u201cSo this is a first actually,\u201d he said.",
        "Royal florist and cookery doyenne Constance Spry worked on flowers for the Queen\u2019s coronation and Mr Connolly said she had flowers from the Commonwealth.\u201cAnd I thought this should be from the nation, the four nations of the kingdom,\u201d he said.Among the seasonal foliage on the High Altar there will be beech cut from an ancient cluster of trees at RHS Bridgewater, which would have been visited by Queen Victoria.Speaking about the personal elements incorporated into the designs, Mr Connolly said: \u201cIt\u2019s all about those personal things. It\u2019s not about showing off. It\u2019s absolutely not about showing off.",
        "\u201cNone of this is price. It\u2019s all about the emotion and the sentiment.\u201cSo I think it\u2019s very special, personally.\u201dFollowing the coronation, all the flowers and branches will be donated to Floral Angels, a charity run by volunteers that repurposes flowers from events into bouquets and arrangements to share with care homes, hospices, shelters and other vulnerable members of the community."
