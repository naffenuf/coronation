        "New Zealander John Mitchell has been named as the new head coach of the England women\u2019s team.",
        "Mitchell, who has had two spells on the coaching team with England\u2019s men\u2019s side in a lengthy career, is currently defence coach for the Japan men\u2019s side and will take up his new role after the Rugby World Cup later this year.Mitchell succeeds Simon Middleton, whose trophy-laden eight-year spell ended with another Six Nations Grand Slam last weekend.He said on englandrugby.com: \u201cThe Red Roses have set an incredible standard and foundation for women\u2019s rugby, being the most successful team in the Six Nations, which is a tremendous achievement.\u201cWe now have the opportunity to build on this, mature in key areas and become a truly champion side that can rightfully contest for the World Cup in 2025.\u201cI would like to honour the hugely supportive Red Roses fans with successful performances as we work towards winning and selling out Twickenham Stadium for the Rugby World Cup in 2025.\u201dThe black mark on Middleton\u2019s reign was two World Cup final defeats to New Zealand and Mitchell\u2019s main target will be to claim the prize on home soil in two years\u2019 time.",
        "Louis Deacon will keep his role as forwards coach and will be acting head coach until Mitchell joins while England\u2019s most capped player and former captain, Sarah Hunter, has been appointed to the role of transition coach, working with the senior team and upcoming players.",
        "Lou Meadows has been promoted from her role as under-20s head coach to attack coach for the senior team, with Charlie Hayter becoming head of women\u2019s performance.Executive director of performance rugby, Conor O\u2019Shea, said: \u201cWe are thrilled to be welcoming John back to England Rugby together with Louis, Charlie, Sarah and Lou.\u201cThis will be a formidable coaching team to take the Red Roses to the next stage in their development.\u201d"
