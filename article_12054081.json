        "Queen Camilla has been crowned beside the King \u2013 a symbolic moment setting the seal on a relationship that has enthralled the nation.",
        "After the coronation of Charles, Camilla was the focus of the ceremony and the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, performed the ancient ritual of anointing and crowning, then called on the Queen to be filled with \u201cprincely virtues\u201d.The Queen\u2019s journey from romantic involvement, to mistress and finally wife of the King has been played out over more than five decades, and ended with her formally becoming the nation\u2019s Queen.",
        "Mr Welby placed Queen Mary\u2019s Crown on the Queen\u2019s head and said: \u201cMay thy servant Camilla, who wears this crown, be filled by thine abundant grace and with all princely virtues; reign in her heart, O King of love, that, being certain of thy protection, she may be crowned with thy gracious favour, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.\u201dThe crown was made for Charles\u2019 great-grandmother, Queen Mary, for George V\u2019s coronation in 1911.Camilla\u2019s decision to use Queen Mary\u2019s Crown is the first time a consort\u2019s crown has been recycled for a coronation rather than a new one created.It has been altered, with four of the eight detachable arches removed to create a different impression and could be renamed Queen Camilla\u2019s Crown in the future.",
        "It used to feature the controversial Koh-i-Noor diamond but the gem was not used and the crown was adapted to include the Cullinan III, IV and V diamonds \u2013 from the late Queen\u2019s personal jewellery collection.",
        "Camilla\u2019s public image has been transformed after she was cast as the third person in the marriage of the then Prince and Princess of Wales, into a campaigning member of the royal family prepared to serve the nation.Underneath she was the down-to-earth Sussex girl who grew up with a love of horses and happened to fall in love with Charles.",
        "During the years she has been married to the King, the Queen has grown into the role and is now an assured host at Buckingham Palace receptions or supporting the King during official overseas visits.Camilla is patron or supporter of a number of literacy charities, speaks out in support of victims of domestic violence and champions several animal welfare organisations.But her most significant role is likely to be in supporting the King and being the comforting presence that enables him to fulfil his role as head of state."
