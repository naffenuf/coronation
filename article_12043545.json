        "NEW YORK, May 3 (Reuters) - Fed Chair Jerome Powell said it was probably good policy that the largest banks are not doing big acquisitions, but said that JPMorgan Chase &amp;amp; Co's acquisition of First Republic Bank was an exception.",
        "Regulators have to follow the law of going with the least-cost bid, Powell said.Regulators seized First Republic and sold its assets to JPMorgan on Monday, in a deal to resolve the largest U.S. bank failure since the 2008 financial crisis and draw a line under a lingering banking turmoil.The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point and signaled it may pause further increases.(Reporting by Megan Davies)"
