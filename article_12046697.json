        "Karen looked elegant at a screening of Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3 Wednesday at iPic Theater in New York City.The Scottish star donned a black double breasted blazer over a sparkling tan ensemble to the cinematic event in the Big Apple, rounding out her ensemble with silver strappy heels.Gillan, who plays the role of Nebula in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, had her straight red locks parted and wore a light layer of makeup.She was pictured in a group shot with her collaborators in the highly-anticipated sequel, including James Gunn, Chris Pratt, Chukwudi Iwuji, Miriam Shor and Bradley Cooper.Gillan told The Hollywood Reporter\u00a0on Tuesday that being involved of the third film in the series has been an impassioned experience.'I can\u2019t stop thinking about it,' Gillan said. 'We shot it a year ago, and it was still such an emotional rollercoaster.",
        "'I was crying hysterically and then I was laughing hysterically, and I would just alternate between those emotions.'In the chat, Gillan spoke about her chemistry with actress Zoe Salana, who plays the character Gamora, as well as an alternate version of the character.",
        "'It did take a little bit of adjusting, just because I have come to know Gamora very well and to be a certain way,' she said of the alternate version. 'And now she\u2019s a very different version of the character, but I thought that [Zoe\u2019s] performance injected it with so much life, because it was so different.'So I love this version of Gamora. She\u2019s really badass, and she\u2019s just willing to do these crazy things in crazy situations, which makes her a bit unpredictable as a character. So I quite enjoyed that.'In the chat, Gillan opened up about her character, saying 'she\u2019s got a new arm courtesy of Rocket.'It is so cool and it basically does everything that anyone needs at any given time. It turns into all sorts of things.'She said of enjoying making the film with the cast, 'It\u2019s just all the little moments where we connected as human beings ... especially because we were all dressed as aliens.'It\u2019s actually so funny because we forget we\u2019re dressed as aliens half the time. I don\u2019t even notice, and that must look really weird from the outside.'",
