        "John Mitchell will take over as England women's head coach later this year\u00a0Simon Middleton stepped down following the Six Nations triumph\u00a0Sarah Hunter and Lou Meadows will be part of Mitchell's coaching staff\u00a0The appointment of John Mitchell as head coach of the Red Roses is a huge missed opportunity by the RFU.",
        "They have not only let their women\u2019s team down, but also women\u2019s sport by not choosing a female successor to Simon Middleton. Once again, it shows the RFU\u2019s lack of vision.I\u2019m the longest-serving member of the International Olympic Committee\u2019s Athletes\u2019 Entourage Commission. A couple of years ago, I was asked to set up and lead a working party to improve the percentage of accredited female coaches at the summer and winter Olympics. It had fallen to below 10 per cent, which just isn\u2019t acceptable.There were several reasons why women weren\u2019t being appointed and it made me question why we have never had a female coach in charge of the England women\u2019s rugby side.We identified multiple barriers which stopped women from reaching top coaching jobs: the fact that women were expected to adapt to the \u2018old boys\u2019 coaching culture, outdated stereotypes that only high-performance coaches were male, and a lack of opportunity. The list went on and on.",
        "What was obvious was that across Olympic sports, there is an unconscious bias towards men for the big coaching roles. That\u2019s because the ones doing the appointing are, with a few exceptions, male.This is what has happened with the RFU\u2019s staggering decision to go for Mitchell, a call that everyone involved with English rugby should be very disappointed with.",
        "The RFU have done so much right with women\u2019s rugby, including being first to hand out professional contracts. There\u2019s been success on the pitch and off it too with a world-record crowd watching last weekend\u2019s Grand Slam win over France. But just when you want to applaud the RFU, they score an own goal.There should have been two criteria for the Red Roses top job. First, the appointee must be female. Second, that person would, ideally, be English. There are plenty of good female coaches in England right now, Giselle Mather at Ealing springs to mind.\u00a0Instead, they\u2019ve gone for Mitchell. He has lots of international experience, but when was the last time he was a head coach? It smacks of jobs for the boys, a decision made by male figures at the RFU. This would not have happened at other organisations.Baroness Sue Campbell has rightly received plenty of praise for her decision to appoint Sarina Wiegman as England women\u2019s football boss. Women\u2019s football has exploded in England on the back of the Lionesses winning the Euros and there is no doubt that Wiegman has been responsible for that.If Campbell had been working at the RFU, there would have been absolutely no chance she\u2019d have chosen Mitchell! Lots of organisations today talk about equality and diversity, the RFU among them, but when it came down to actions \u2014 not words \u2014 they\u2019ve been found wanting.",
        "No doubt those responsible will say they have female representation as part of Mitchell\u2019s coaching staff. Former captain Sarah Hunter \u2014 a true England great \u2014 will be part of the set-up and so will another woman in Lou Meadows. But, the game-changing role here is head coach and Mitchell is in that position.I wish Hunter and Meadows could have been in a position to turn down their roles but I understand why they haven\u2019t, given the situation women find themselves in elite sport.England have lost the last two World Cup finals to New Zealand and Mitchell\u2019s challenge will be to go one better and deliver global glory on home soil in 2025.Even if that happens there will still be many who will lament the fact a female head coach won\u2019t be lifting the trophy. What a massive missed opportunity."
