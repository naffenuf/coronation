        "Rachael Rogers is a US-based certified parenting coach who frequently shares tips on gentle parenting and understanding your child's emotions on her Instagram and TikTok.\u00a0Most recently, the 40 year old revealed why a child's good behavior is not always a sign of respect and trust.\u00a0The mom to daughter Peyton, four, shocked parents when she explained that kids who don't act out, are actually in 'fear' of you in a viral video that amassed over 2.4 million views.\u00a0",
        "'A child will show their most authentic self and their most vulnerable emotions to the people they trust the most,' she said at the beginning of her clip after admitting she would make 'caregiver' angry with this video.\u00a0Rachel went on to explain that children who act out aren't doing it out of disrespect, but rather because they are comfortable around you.\u00a0This means that if a child is 'well-behaved,' then it's likely they are scared to express themselves around you.\u00a0'That means that if a child is always very well-behaved and a good little girl or boy in front of you, they don't fully trust you, they fear you.'They are afraid of what you will do to them if they do show their most authentic self or if they do show their most vulnerable emotions,' she explained.\u00a0",
        "The mom-of-one noted that many times parents praise their children for their good behavior because they believe it's a sign of 'respect.'\u00a0However, Rachel said respect has nothing to do with it, adding that if your kid is never shows their emotions it indicates a troubling relationship.\u00a0'We like to say that it's respect, but it's not, it's fear,' she said at the end of her video.\u00a0",
        "Fellow parents and children chimed in and flooded Rachel's comments section with words of praise, noting that she was right on point.\u00a0One mom commented: 'I have seen this transition with all of my kids. Now they are the most off-the-chain, respectful kids I know! Make your kids feel safe! It's worth it!'\u00a0'Agreed. My autistic son always meltdown with me. We\u2019ve worked 12 years on it too. And we are so close. He will tell you I\u2019m his best friend,' said another user.\u00a0'I wish my family understood this. They just say I\u2019m being manipulated by my child,' someone else said.\u00a0'This is so true,' added another user.\u00a0One person added: 'As a child that\u2019s been abused, this is so true.'\u00a0"
