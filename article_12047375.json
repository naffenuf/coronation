        "Legal &amp; General is to shut production at its modular housing factory in North Yorkshire, putting 475 jobs at risk.",
        "After years of weak demand, it is understood that the company is consulting with all 475 staff at the L&amp;G Modular Homes business in Selby, with the majority facing redundancy.L&amp;G blamed \u2018long planning delays\u2019 and the pandemic for weak orders for its pre-built homes. It said it could not \u2018sustain the significant running costs of the large factory\u2019 as a result.",
        "Bill Hughes, chairman of L&amp;G Modular\u2019s board, said: \u2018Legal &amp; General is proud of what we have achieved in bringing forward a new approach to construction through our factory.\u2018However, without the necessary scale of pipeline it is not sustainable to continue producing more modules.\u2018We are therefore reluctantly proposing to reduce business activity and cease production of new modules at the factory.\u2018We recognise this will be a challenging and uncertain period for staff and we will be actively exploring redeployment opportunities.\u2019",
