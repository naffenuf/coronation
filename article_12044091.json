        "Sir Keir Starmer has been accused of being \u201cshifty\u201d over questions about Sue Gray and has been urged to \u201cfess up\u201d about when contact with her about a top Labour job was first made.",
        "The Opposition leader has repeatedly refused to disclose the timeline of the talks held with the partygate investigator about her becoming his chief of staff.Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove said Sir Keir was \u201cavoiding the question\u201d when it came to divulging when the job offer was made to the former senior civil servant.The comments came after Sky News reported that the Labour leader initiated contact with Ms Gray about the position in October, at least four months before her appointment was announced. I think it is unchivalrous and wrong of Keir Starmer not to fess up  Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove  Mr Gove refused to criticise Ms Gray\u2019s decision to leave the Cabinet Office, where she had previously worked with the senior Conservative minister, but demanded answers from her future boss.Speaking to ITV\u2019s Peston programme, he said: \u201cThe person who can clear this all up is Keir Starmer.\u201cAll Keir Starmer needs to do is co-operate, to say what the contacts were that he initiated.\u201cAnd I think it is unchivalrous and wrong of Keir Starmer not to fess up.\u201cHe should be straight, he shouldn\u2019t be sort of \u2018taking the Fifth (Amendment)\u2019 and avoiding the question.\u201cIt only reinforces the impression that people have that he is shifty and that he can\u2019t be straight with us.\u201d",
        "Prime Minister Rishi Sunak also made his view on the situation public on Wednesday, with his press secretary saying it was \u201cobviously disappointing\u201d that Ms Gray had chosen not to engage with a Government process looking into her planned switch to Labour.Labour has defended her decision not to contribute to the Cabinet Office probe into the circumstances of her departure, calling it a \u201cpolitical gimmick\u201d.Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden, who gave an update to MPs on Tuesday about the review, said the department had submitted a \u201cconfidential assessment\u201d to the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba).The independent appointments watchdog will recommend a cooling-off period of between three months and two years to avoid any conflict of interest once it concludes its own separate review into Ms Gray\u2019s exit in March.Mr Dowden did not, despite apparent briefings to the press, say that Ms Gray had broken Civil Service rules by speaking to the Opposition while still working for the Government.While civil servants have to remain politically neutral, former Whitehall officials have questioned how a new job could be taken up without some contact with a new employer \u2014 in this case, a political party.",
        "Nick Thomas-Symonds, Labour\u2019s shadow trade secretary, said the party leader\u2019s office had \u201centirely followed the correct process\u201d.",
        "Speaking to Peston, the senior Opposition MP added that he \u201cwouldn\u2019t be surprised\u201d if Acoba recommended a \u201cperiod of gardening leave\u201d for Sue Gray.The Civil Service Code dictates that a high-ranking Whitehall official of Ms Gray\u2019s standing cannot take a political position for three months, but the appointments watchdog could choose to extend that.Mr Thomas-Symonds called Ms Gray, who led a Government investigation into allegations of parties being held in Boris Johnson\u2019s Downing Street operation during the coronavirus lockdown, a former official of \u201cgreat integrity\u201d and praised her \u201cremarkable career\u201d.\u201cI think we\u2019ve got to a stage here where so little do the Conservatives have to offer the country, we\u2019re talking about Labour staff recruitment,\u201d Mr Thomas-Symonds added.Labour questioned the Tory focus on the Gray affair on the eve of English local elections in which Mr Sunak\u2019s party is predicting it could lose 1,000 seats.A party spokesman said: \u201cTo be banging on about Sue Gray the day before the local elections shows just how out of touch the Tories are.\u201cOnly Labour has a plan to cut crime, cut waiting lists and cut the cost of living.\u201cSadly for the country, the Tories only want to talk about one former civil servant.\u201dAsked about Sky\u2019s claim that contact was first made with Ms Gray in October, Labour said: \u201cAll the information has gone to Acoba and not going to comment during an active process.\u201d"
