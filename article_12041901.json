        "Labour had their \u201cNick Clegg moment\u201d by dropping plans to abolish tuition fees, according to the SNP\u2019s Westminster leader.",
        "Stephen Flynn criticised the move and argued it means none of the main Westminster parties offer \u201cany hope at all\u201d to young people.Former Liberal Democrat deputy prime minister Mr Clegg was forced to apologise in 2012 for breaking his pre-election commitment to oppose increasing student tuition fees.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer this week confirmed he would \u201cmove on\u201d from his commitment to abolish tuition fees. For the avoidance of any doubt, the Liberal Democrats don't believe in abolishing tuition fees, the Conservatives don't believe in abolishing tuition fees and, of course, the Labour Party, with their own Nick Clegg moment, don't believe in abolishing tuition fees either  Stephen Flynn, SNP MP  Speaking in the Commons, Mr Flynn told Prime Minister\u2019s Questions: \u201cIn 2010 David Cameron convinced Nick Clegg to drop his pledge on university tuition fees.\u201cDoes the Prime Minister intend to take the credit for convincing the leader of the Labour Party to do likewise?\u201d",
        "Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, to laughter, replied: \u201cI thank the honourable gentleman for the question. It\u2019s hard to keep up with the list of broken promises.\u201cWhat I would say on tuition fees is I\u2019m proud under this Government that we now have a record number of people that are going to university from disadvantaged backgrounds.\u201d",
        "Mr Flynn added: \u201cFor the avoidance of any doubt, the Liberal Democrats don\u2019t believe in abolishing tuition fees, the Conservatives don\u2019t believe in abolishing tuition fees and, of course, the Labour Party, with their own Nick Clegg moment, don\u2019t believe in abolishing tuition fees either.\u201cIs it not the case that the main Westminster parties don\u2019t offer young people any hope at all, do they?\u201dMr Sunak replied: \u201cI gently point out to (Mr Flynn) that if you\u2019re from a disadvantaged background, you\u2019re far more likely to go to university in England than you are in Scotland.\u201d"
