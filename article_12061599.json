        "Sydney Watson says women are relegated\u00a0\u00a0Aussie tells US TV trans' feelings get priority\u00a0Activist is defender\u00a0of biological women\u00a0 \u00a0An Australian-born conservative commentator has told a high-profile US talk show that the feelings of trans' people are 'superseding' those of biological women.",
        "Sydney Watson, who was raised in Melbourne, appeared on the high-rating Dr Phil\u00a0 show that aired in mid April as part of a panel discussion on the topic 'Are women being erased?'.Dr Watson, who has a YouTube channel dedicated to her commentary that has nearly 900,000 subscribers, did not hold back while addressing the trans representatives who were taking part.'What we always seem to fixate on is the trans experience and that's how it feels for us biological women,' Dr Watson said.'We are always focusing on the trans feel or how the non-binary people feel we get left out of the conversation oftentimes and it is very frustrating for us because there are very unique issues that affect us in a way you will never understand.'",
        "Dr Watson went to say that she wasn't saying the experience of trans' people is invalid 'or that we should relegate you to the back of the bus'.'We live in a world that will always be different by the fact that we are biological women, we are different' Dr Watson argued.'You know what's upsetting for us to be told that our very existence is superseded by the feelings of others. That is how we feel and it is very, very, very frustrating.'\u00a0",
        "However, she stressed that women could embrace trans people and their issues.'I couldn't imagine how stressful and painful it must be to be trans because you are always fighting against the biology that you have and the nature you want to have,' Dr Watson said.'That has to be very challenging.'",
        "Kent State Associate Professor in Communications twice interrupted Dr Watson and the host, former clinical psychologist and Oprah Winfrey show alumni\u00a0 Dr Phil McGraw, tried to interject once but she gave them both short shrift.In posting the clip of her contribution on Twitter Dr Watson commented: 'I mean everything I said on Dr Phil - but I especially meant it when I wouldn't let the leftist to my side interrupt me.'\u00a0On her YouTube channel Dr Watson, 29, reflected on her appearance in a video posted on May 1.While saying the producers and most of the staff were 'lovely' Dr Watson described the overall experience as a 'sh*t show' and 'completely infuriating'.",
        "Dr Watson said the large size of the panel that had about a dozen people taking part was not conducive to good discussion and\u00a0also lamented the episode got bogged down in debate about gendered language debate or as she called it 'gender muck'.She said that while trans people are 'advertised as a particularly vulnerable and misaligned minority' their voices always seem to dominate any discussion of sex and gender.",
        "'The fact that I was sitting on a panel with other women desperately trying to provide adequate justification for my experiences as a female and why those experiences are unique and deserving of recognition tells you everything you need to know about the power imbalance here,' she argued.Despite her annoyances with the show Dr Watson said she would go back on Dr Phil if invited.'I wish that I had done a lot more talking during this episode,' she said.'These conversations almost force us to beg to be validated as our actual sex and that is so sad it\u2019s like a biological struggle session.'After being raised in Melbourne by her Australian father and American mother Dr Watson moved to the US in 2019 to pursue a career as a political pundit and lives in Texas.\u00a0"
