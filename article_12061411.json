        "The SNP would \u201cundo Brexit as far as possible\u201d if the next general election results in a hung parliament, the party has said.",
        "Analysis of England\u2019s local authority election results indicates Labour could fall short of a majority in the Commons when the UK next goes to the polls.SNP EU accession spokesman Alyn Smyth said his party would demand the UK has a close relationship with EU, in negotiations with a minority Labour government.He said ahead of seeking to row back on Brexit, the SNP\u2019s key demands for the relationship between the UK and the EU would be to secure single market membership and restore free movement. With all the signs pointing to a hung Parliament, the SNP could force a minority Labour government to rejoin the EU single market  Alyn Smith, SNP EU accession spokesman  The SNP is one of the only major parties to support rejoining the EU, as Labour has ruled out any Brexit reversal and the Liberal Democrats have dropped calls for a rerun of the EU referendum.Mr Smith said: \u201cBrexit has been a disaster for Scotland and the UK \u2013 costing our economy billions, damaging the NHS, and contributing to the cost of living crisis \u2013 and there\u2019s been a conspiracy of silence on it from Labour and the Tories.\u201cWhile independence is the only way for Scotland to regain our EU membership, the SNP could hold the balance of power at the next election and we would use our influence to undo Brexit as far as possible and demand the UK has a close relationship with the EU.",
        "\u201cWith all the signs pointing to a hung parliament, the SNP could force a minority Labour government to rejoin the EU single market, reintroduce free movement and transfer power for an independence referendum to Edinburgh, so Scotland can regain our place in Europe.\u201d",
        "He added: \u201cThe SNP would also push for the UK to rejoin Erasmus and Horizon Europe, and defend the European Court of Justice, while ensuring Scotland has the power to escape Brexit entirely with independence.\u201cAt the next election, voting SNP is the only way to beat the Tories in Scotland \u2013 and a strong team of SNP MPs can get the best deal for Scotland, including powers over an independence referendum, a close relationship with Europe and making the cost of living crisis a key priority.\u201dThe vast majority of Scots believe the UK Government is handling Brexit badly, according the latest YouGov poll on May 1 which found 84% of Scots and 67% of people across the UK think this.Only 9% of Scots and 22% of people across the UK told pollsters they believe the UK Government is handling Brexit well.Shadow Scottish secretary Ian Murray said: \u201cThis is a desperate bid for relevance from an out of touch and scandal-hit party.\u201cYet again the SNP is trying to talk up the Tories because they are terrified of a Labour government.",
        "\u201cOnly Labour can fix the mess the Tories have made of Brexit and build a stronger trading relationship with Europe.\u201cAt the next election we will be focused on booting the Tories out of Downing Street and delivering the change our country desperately needs.\u201cLabour will not do any deals with the SNP under any circumstances and it is Tory fantasy politics to pretend otherwise.\u201d"
