        "More pharmacies are expected to close unless the Government provides \u201curgently\u201d needed funding to the \u201cstruggling\u201d sector, industry leaders have said.",
        "The warnings come as healthcare providers await Government proposals to improve access to primary care, which are expected on Tuesday.Leyla Hannbeck, chief executive of the Association of Independent Multiple Pharmacies, said workforce challenges have led to many pharmacies shutting their doors \u201cfor good\u201d since 2015, when the sector received a \u201cbig\u201d funding cut.She told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cWe are expecting that this year many more will do the same unless the Government comes out and injects pharmacy with some liquidity and funding to keep the sector going.\u201d For pharmacists to keep their head above the water something needs to be done urgently  Leyla Hannbeck  Ms Hannbeck said there is a \u00a31.1 billion shortfall in funding every year which has resulted in many pharmacies operating at a loss and struggling to pay medicine wholesalers\u2019 bills.\u201cFor pharmacists to keep their head above the water something needs to be done urgently,\u201d she added.",
        "Thorrun Govind, chair of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society in England, cited increased staffing, energy and drug costs as some of the issues the sector is facing.She told BBC One\u2019s Breakfast show that pharmacies in England could and would like to do \u201cso much more\u201d \u2013 highlighting \u201cindependent prescribers\u201d in Scottish pharmacies as one example of how sector workers could do more to support individuals with health needs.",
        "\u201cWhen I\u2019m working in the pharmacy there\u2019s often occasions where I know what treatment is required but I can\u2019t provide it because I\u2019m hindered by the system that I\u2019m working in,\u201d Ms Govind told the BBC.\u201cPeople may need support with fungal nail infections but for example the cost of that is quite high if you\u2019re having to use it for a long period of time, which they tend to need, so they\u2019re saying to me, \u2018Well I need to go to the GP and get a prescription for that because it will cost me less in the long term\u2019.\u201dShe said pharmacies could provide regular support for patients with long-term conditions and help people with common ailments \u2013 such as coughs, colds, flus and sore throats \u2013 easing the burden on GPs. If King Charles needs any support with neck pain following that crown... he can make sure he speaks to his pharmacist  Thorrun Govind, Royal Pharmaceutical Society in England  Ms Govind added that increased funding for pharmacies would also improve staff retention \u2013 with workers currently at risk of \u201cburnout\u201d \u2013 and tackle health inequalities.\u201cPharmacists are really accessible \u2013 about a 20-minute walk for most people \u2013 and the staff there tend to be from the communities from where they are working so actually health inequalities are also being tackled when we have pharmacies open,\u201d she said.",
