        "\u00a0Editor-in-chief of Vogue Edward Enninful spotted chewing gum at Coronation\u00a0Fashion journalist, 51, arrived at Westminster Abbey with pop star Katy Perry\u00a0Social media users posted that they could see other guests committing faux pasAs the editor-in-chief of British Vogue, Edward Enninful is usually a reliable bastion of good taste.",
        "But the 51-year-old made a rare misstep as a Coronation guest on Saturday when he appeared to arrive at Westminster Abbey chewing gum.Eagle-eyed onlookers took to Twitter to criticise the fashion journalist, who was pictured arriving for the ceremony with pop star Katy Perry.Videos of the pair, who were searching for Katy\u2019s seat, seemed to show Enninful breaking etiquette as he chewed away while scanning the aisles.One commentator icily said: \u2018Chewing gum is not a good look in the Abbey.\u2019\u00a0",
        "Enninful is British Vogue\u2019s first black editor and has been at the helm since 2017. He wore a bespoke morning suit by Savile Row tailor Huntsman and a navy tie.Viewers watching the ceremony on TV were quick to point out that several esteemed guests appeared to be committing the faux pas.\u2018It might be the teacher librarian in me,\u2019 one wrote, \u2018but all I can see is people chewing gum.\u2019\u00a0Another said: \u2018Tuned into #Coronation to see a Commonwealth dignitary entering the Abbey chewing GUM! I wonder where he\u2019ll stick it.\u2019Perhaps Enninful can claim he\u2019s simply following a Royal trend \u2013 David Beckham drew attention at Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u2019s wedding in May 2018 for chewing \u2018like it\u2019s a football dugout\u2019, as one viewer put it."
