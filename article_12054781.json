        "St Johnstone interim boss Steven MacLean praised the attitude of his players as the Perth side edged closer towards cinch Premiership safety with a vital 1-0 win over Dundee United at McDiarmid Park.",
        "Captain Liam Gordon steered home the crucial goal from close range after a Stevie May miscue before United saw Charlie Mulgrew sent off for hauling down Melker Hallberg.Steven Fletcher hit the goalframe for the visitors in the last minute but St Johnstone held on for a first victory since they beat the same opposition in February. It was also their first triumph at McDiarmid Park since they beat Rangers in early November.After taking four points from his two games in charge, MacLean hopes his side have stopped the rot.He said: \u201cI\u2019m proud. Happy for the players and happy for the supporters. I think it was deserved. I thought we played well.\u201cWe had to defend at the end which is what you have to do because they\u2019re fighting for their lives as well.",
        "\u201cThey threw caution to the wind and threw bodies towards, put (Ryan) Edwards on up front so it\u2019s always going to be tricky but we defended really well.\u201cIf I\u2019ve got a gripe, it would be that we could\u2019ve scored more. We had 17 shots. That\u2019s 14 shots and 17 shots in the last two games which is good but we want to keep building.\u201cI\u2019m delighted. The players have reacted well and I\u2019ve got a reaction out of them but it\u2019s only one game.",
        "\u201cWe\u2019re in tomorrow and we\u2019re going to prepare for Motherwell and we\u2019re going to do everything right.\u201dMacLean also insisted he has not had any conversations with chairman Steve Brown about his long-term future, with his focus firmly on Saints\u2019 fight against the drop.He added: \u201cThere\u2019s been nothing. Hopefully he\u2019ll be happy with me for getting a result. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll speak to him. I spoke to him on Thursday.\u201cHe was good \u2013 he asked me how it had been and I thank him for giving me the opportunity. Hopefully he can sleep well tonight.Dundee United manager Jim Goodwin, meanwhile, rued Fletcher\u2019s late miss as he praised his side for staying in the game.He said: \u201cCredit to the players, they never gave up. We tried to get as many offensive bodies on the pitch as possible towards the end and we knew we\u2019d leave ourselves light and we were hit on the counter on a couple of occasions.\u201cI think if Fletcher\u2019s effort at the end goes in then, over the piece, a draw would have been a fair outcome.\u201dThe United boss also said he has not decided if his club will appeal against the red card shown to Mulgrew.The defender was beaten to the ball by Hallberg and he caught the midfielder who was through on goal, although the offence did take place out wide towards the touchline.",
        "Goodwin added: \u201cI haven\u2019t had the chance to watch it back so I\u2019ll wait and see, and sit with the analyst. Then we\u2019ll give a response.\u201cI\u2019m reluctant to comment (on the prospect of losing Mulgrew) but of course Charlie has been a very important player.\u201cWe\u2019ll have a look back at the situation. Was there a covering defender? Was it a clear goalscoring opportunity? And we\u2019ll assess that on Monday morning and decide which way we want to go.\u201d"
