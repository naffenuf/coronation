        "\u00a0Barcelona fans to be refused entry to Espanyol if they are wearing club colours\u00a0\u00a0City rivals\u00a0repeat stance imposed on them by Barcelona earlier in the campaign\u00a0\u00a0Barca will be confirmed as La Liga champions with a win in the local derby\u00a0Barcelona fans will be denied entry to Espanyol's RCDE Stadium on Sunday if they\u00a0 wear any items that represent the club's famous colours.\u00a0",
        "The LaLiga leaders will seal the title with a win over their rivals next weekend, while also deepening their rival's relegation fears, with Luis Garcia's men currently three points from safety.\u00a0However, any fans looking to fly the flag in celebration of Xavi's men's title winning triumph will not be allowed into Espanyol's stadium if they are sporting any attire that is in the red and blue of Barcelona.\u00a0The stance from Barca's local rivals is in direct response to the same measures that the Catalan club made ahead of the reverse fixture in December.\u00a0Ahead of the first derby of the campaign, Barcelona banned away fans from attending the fixture.\u00a0",
        "While any fans wearing the blue and white jersey were barred from entering the stadium, along with any fans with Espanyol emblems or flags.\u00a0A statement at the time from Barca read:\u00a0'The sale of tickets for Espanyol fans is prohibited. Likewise, fans who come with Espanyol clothing or emblems will be denied entry to the stadium.'\u00a0The club's defence was that it wanted to prevent a repeat of what happened when Barcelona clashed with Eintracht Frankfurt in last season's Europa League.\u00a030,000 Frankfurt fans\u00a0overran the stadium and dominated the audience as tickets were distributed within the Barcelona stands of the stadium.\u00a0",
        "The December meeting between the two sides, saw the rivals fight out an ill-tempered 1-1 draw in front of a crowd of 88,000 Barca fans.\u00a0Both sides finished the game with ten men as Jordi Alba saw red for Barcelona, while Vinicius Souza saw red for the visitors. The game also saw 15 yellow cards dished out by\u00a0referee Mateu Lahoz - including one for Barca boss Xavi.\u00a0Espanyol are second bottom of LaLiga and three points behind Valencia, while their rivals will be confirmed champions if they win the derby.\u00a0"
