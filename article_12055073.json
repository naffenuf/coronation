        "ST. PETERBURG, Fla. (AP) - New York Yankees manager Aaron Boone expects slugger Aaron Judge will return from a right hip strain for Tuesday night's game against the Oakland Athletics.",
        "Judge worked out Saturday at the team's minor league complex in Tampa, Florida, about 30 minutes from where the Yankees were playing the Rays.\"I think he\u00b4s doing really well,\" Boone said before playing the Rays. \"I think we\u00b4re going to be in a good spot come Tuesday to where he\u00b4s done everything for several days.\"\"That was the calculus in this weekend,\" Boone added. \"It\u00b4s like, do we want to push him back out there if he\u00b4s 85, 90%. I wasn\u00b4t comfortable doing that just because I don\u00b4t want a strain to turn into a bad situation where we\u00b4re talking six, eight weeks.\"Judge hasn't played since April 27 and missed his eighth games Saturday. The injury-depleted Yankees started Saturday with a 17-16 record and trailed the major league-best Rays by 10 games in the AL East.Third baseman Josh Donaldson, out since April 6 with a right hamstring strain, worked out with Judge and is to intensify his on-field drills during the upcoming week ahead of a possible minor league rehabilitation assignment.",
        "Boone said that designated hitter Giancarlo Stanton, sidelined since April 16 due to a strained left hamstring, is not as close as Donaldson to coming back but is making progress.\"He\u00b4s doing well.\" Boone said. \"I've been kind of encouraged with how is progress has gone pretty well.\"",
