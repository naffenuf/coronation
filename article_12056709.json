        "Portsmouth boss John Mousinho is optimistic about next season after an entertaining 2-2 draw at home to Wycombe.",
        "Pompey equalised twice, through Marlon Pack and Paddy Lane, with Garath McCleary and Lewis Wing \u2013\u00a0 with a long-range screamer \u2013 on target for the visitors in the final match of the 2022-23 Sky Bet League One campaign.Mousinho said: \u201cWe could have scored more today. We had chance after chance after chance, but it just didn\u2019t fall for us.\u201cOf the two conceded, the first one was sloppy, but the second was a wonder goal. One of those one-offs from about 50 yards.\u201cIf today\u2019s performance is anything to go by, then the future looks promising.\u201cObviously the fans want us to shoot all the time but I felt that we did turn down a few opportunities to shoot in the first half.",
        "\u201cThe way we build is excellent at times and I was absolutely thrilled with how we did that today.\u201cI think Paddy Lane has been excellent the last couple of games after a torrid six months. He\u2019s looking good.\u201dPompey were the dominant side in the first half, yet it was Wycombe who opened the scoring in the 31st minute.A dreadful pass out from goalkeeper Josh Oluwayemi went straight to the feet of McCleary, who swept forward to power the ball under the goalkeeper\u2019s body.Pompey fought back and deservedly levelled in the 44th minute as a second corner in as many minutes saw a Michael Jacobs cross headed home by Pack at the back post.",
        "The second half continued to entertain and in the 54th minute Wing hammered home from far out. However, Lane levelled 18 minutes later to ensure a point apiece.Wycombe boss Matt Bloomfield is also looking forward to the next campaign.He said: \u201cWe needed a good response to last week\u2019s defeat (3-0 at home to Cheltenham) and I don\u2019t think the players needed telling that. I\u2019ve sensed in training that this sort of performance was possible today.\u201cThere was anger in the team after last week, and with nearly a thousand supporters making the trip, they didn\u2019t want to disappoint.\u201cWe wanted to set the stall for next season, and I thought we did that. Three points would have been nice, but I thought a draw was fair overall.\u201cWe could have had a winner at the end, and would question the offside decision, but that\u2019s football.\u201cI thought we showed as an attacking threat overall. We certainly didn\u2019t want to come here and play out a boring 90 minutes and a 0-0 before people go on their holidays.\u201cWe\u2019re excited about the future of this club. It\u2019s a special place to be and I\u2019m pleased to be here.\u201d"
