        "During Monday's episode, former Coronation Street actress Helen Flanagan was seen reading out a note to let the campmates know of Janice's departure.However, footage of Janice's fall was not shown, leading some fans of the show to take to social media to question if Janice had actually left simply because she did not want to continue with the show.\u00a0One person tweeted: 'Hummm could this have been intentional??! She did not look like she was loving it!', while someone else exclaimed: 'Fall my foot!'Someone else wrote: 'She probably did it on purpose,' while another person posted: 'She couldn't be bothered anymore is the truth of it.''She didn't fall, just an excuse to leave,' wrote someone else.Someone else remarked: '\"Fall\" yeah okay. Because we ARE that stupid to believe that.'MailOnline has contacted ITV for comment.\u00a0Janice Dickinson was forced to quit 'I'm A Celebrity ...

        "She was stretchered off and taken by ambulance to hospital to treat her injuries and she wasn't allowed to return to camp.Janice told The Sun newspaper's TV Mag: 'In the middle of one night I woke up because I had to go to the dunny [toilet] ... The campfire had gone out and it was as dark as it could be.\u00a0So I thought: \"Right, I\u2019ll make it to the dunny from memory.\"'I walked a couple of steps and tripped, flying flat on my face \u2013 hair all over my forehead, my nose was bloody and my whole chin was gashed open. Blood was gushing from all these areas, and there was dirt and stones embedded in my face from the fall.'She was rescued by campmates Fatima Whitbread and Phil Tufnell who got her back to the main camp and called for a medic.Janice went on: '[The doctor] said: \"Oh my! We have to take her to the medical hut\" so they could wash away the blood, stones and dirt in case infection set in.",
        "'They gave me pain relief, put me on a stretcher and four men galloped me out along the road in the middle of the night in the cold air, two feet above the ground.",
        "'We reached an ambulance and the paramedics put a compress on my forehead and my chin. It was bad. I was in this tiny hospital in the middle of nowhere and they called my husband [Robert Gerner], who was in South Africa, to bring him to the hospital.'At the hospital, the doctors cleaned up her cuts and scrapes and gave her more painkillers.However, Janice was unable to rejoin the rest of her campmates and her time in the show came to an end.Georgia and Andy\u00a0were eliminated from I'm A Celebrity...
