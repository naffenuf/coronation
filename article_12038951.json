        "Prolific Haaland has scored 50 goals for in all competitions this seasonMan City have moulded the 22-year-old into a more rounded centre forwardGuardiola believes his quest for improvement makes him an even greater threat\u00a0Pep Guardiola has warned that Erling Haaland will be even better next season as the Norwegian stands on the verge of smashing Premier League records.",
        "Manchester City host West Ham with Haaland one goal from surpassing Alan Shearer and Andrew Cole\u2019s tallies of 34, both set when the division comprised 22 teams.Haaland has a half-century in all competitions this season and Guardiola believes the 22-year-old\u2019s constant quest for improvement makes him an even greater threat, likening his hunger to Lionel Messi\u2019s.\u2018His game can improve a lot,\u2019 said the City manager.\u2018He has the desire to get better \u2014 as long as he has that, he can do it. To go to work knowing you can do something better is the way. He has that feeling of, \u201cIs that enough?\u201d \u2018When you talk with him he is open-minded, saying, \u201cYeah, I have to do it, I can do it better\u201d. That\u2019s so positive for his career.",
        "\u2018It\u2019s not arrogance. It\u2019s self-confidence to say I am going to score. To arrive in his first season and score 50 already, equalling the record for two legends in Cole and Shearer, that\u2019s so big.\u2018No one can compare with Messi, it will not help Erling, but in terms of goals and mentality yes. He has got to the same level in terms of goals. It\u2019s almost every game, he scores a goal. One or two every game but Messi is the most complete player I have seen.\u2019",
        "City have moulded Haaland into a more rounded centre forward. Only eight players \u2014 including Kevin De Bruyne, set to miss on Wednesday night with a knee problem \u2014 have provided more assists in the Premier League this season and there has been a noticeable willingness for the striker to become more involved in their build-up play.\u2018We have the feeling every game he will score a goal and that helps a lot,\u2019 Guardiola added. \u2018But it\u2019s not just about that. He gives us many things, pressing, defensively. He is involved in long balls and before we didn\u2019t have that.",
        "\u2018How he helps us to keep the ball, link with him and after runs with the other players. He helps to give us an extra issue that we maybe didn\u2019t have in the past. Gabriel Jesus was exceptional but now we have Erling\u2019s presence. We have to use it.\u2019Guardiola said that it took City\u2019s midfielders time to get used to having a proper striker to hit. He used video sessions to hammer home how to engineer the best from Haaland.\u2018Many times in the beginning he made movements between the central defenders and we didn\u2019t pass the ball because we were not used to those type of balls,\u2019 he said.\u00a0",
        "\u2018One game I remember having 25 clips and we said, \u201cLook at Erling, the\u00a0movements he has\u201d.\u2018Everyone said if you give him the ball he is in front of goal, so why did you not give it to him? That\u2019s why everyone said it would be difficult to adapt.\u2019"
