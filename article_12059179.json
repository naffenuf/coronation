        "Rangers eye Trusty after impressive loan spellArsenal's Auston Trusty is emerging as the man Rangers want to strengthen their defence this summer.Birmingham City fans, buoyed by today's news that the club have secured new investment from American hedge fund manager Tom Wagner's Shelby Companies Limited, know you can put your trust in Trusty as they named him their player of the year last week.The 24-year-old centre-back only joined Arsenal last year from Colorado Rapids and was immediately loaned out to Birmingham, where he has been almost ever-present this season.Though not the most technical of footballers, Trusty concentrates on defending and is a strong athlete. His performances have been such that he earned a first call-up to the USA side last month. Rangers are keen to get a deal done with Arsenal for around \u00a32million.",
        "The Glasgow club have already agreed to sign midfielder Kieran Dowell who had run down his contract at Norwich City. They have discussed a move for Crystal Palace keeper Jack Butland, who is on loan at Manchester United, but that is still too expensive for their budget. United have also yet to make a decision on whether to offer Butland a deal for next season with Palace holding an option on the 30-year-old's contract.Erik ten Hag still wants David de Gea to sign a new contract and ideally wants new signings in by the start of pre-season, takeover permitting.",

        "Palace would be loath to lose Olise, particularly with Wilfried Zaha also expected to go, but they have been busy trying to close a deal for Flamengo's 19-year-old Matheus Franca over the past month. Palace sporting director Dougie Freedman was understood to be in South America last week as talks intensify over a fee rising to around \u00a325m for Franca.Olise, though born in Hammersmith, speaks French thanks to his mother.\u00a0Chelsea and Man United decide Osimhen priceHe has been marvelled at by Atletico Madrid and AC Milan but Chelsea's own 'Captain America' Christian Pulisic is drawing greater attention from Napoli and Juventus.The 24-year-old USA international is one of several players Chelsea are looking to sell this summer before his contract runs down and he is desperate to play more regularly.",
        "Napoli's interest could add extra spice as Chelsea want their star striker Victor Osimhen.\u00a0Napoli are insisting publicly that the Nigerian is not for sale but the general consensus, at least between Chelsea and Manchester united, is that he is for around \u00a3130million.\u00a0That figure is already too high for Bayern Munich, who are concentrating on Randal Kolo Muani from Eintracht Frankfurt, and it will be a problem for Chelsea under scrutiny of Financial Fair play. They will look at who could be put into an offer for Osimhen with Romelu Lukaku, due back from Inter this summer, another one to consider.",
        "Chelsea have discussed signing Inter Milan's Andre Onana though he is not thought to be goalkeeper favoured by Mauricio Pochettino, who is expected to be confirmed as the club's next manager this week.Tottenham look to poach Brentford technical directorBrentford technical director Lee Dykes has emerged as a contender for a senior role at Tottenham following the resignation of Fabio Paratici.Tottenham, who still hope to appoint Julian Nagelsmann as coach, want a new sporting director and Dykes is one of the names in the frame alongside Johannes Spors. Dykes, 38, has worked in all four of the English league's professional divisions.The main task, once a new coach is in place, will be to ascertain Harry Kane's next step. As Confidential reported previously, Kane is leaning towards seeing out his contract but there have been early soundings from intermediaries on behalf of Manchester United and Paris St Germain. Real Madrid and Bayern are also maintaining a watching brief on the England captain.Meanwhile, Tottenham are the latest club to check on Sheffield United's in-form striker Iliman Ndiaye.Club scouts watched him score his 15th goal of the season against Preston North End last month. Everton also like the 23-year-old.",

        "The 20-year-old Williams, with a \u00a350million release clause, was the subject of an offer from Aston Villa in January and has been followed by Arsenal too.Newcastle have the likes of James Maddison, Mason Mount, Declan Rice and Kieran Tierney on their wishlist but with competition fierce and prices even more so, they need alternatives.\u00a0Spain international Williams is in the mix as is Bayer Leverkusen's Dominik Szoboszlai, who has a \u00a365m release clause, but Diaby has drifted out of contention. Newcastle scouts have been continuing to keep an eye on Blackburn Rovers prospect Adam Wharton though.Barca fighting to keep DembeleAston Villa-bound Mateu Alemany is trying to wrap up a new contract for Ousmane Dembele before he leaves Barcelona.France flyer Dembele, who is friends with Chelsea's Pierre Emerick Aubameyang, has a \u00a345m release clause applicable to this summer so Barcelona are keen to get that cancelled and offer improved terms - if they can fit in yet another financial improvement under current restrictions.\u00a0Alemany held the first meeting with Dembele's agent last Monday and the 25-year-old winger's deal runs out next summer. Barca, meanwhile, want current consultant Jordi Cruyff to replace Alemany when he heads for Birmingham.",
