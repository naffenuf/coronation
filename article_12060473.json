        "CAIRO, May 8 (Reuters) - Sudan's military ruler General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan said on Monday the negotiations in Saudi Arabia with the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces will have no benefit without reaching a ceasefire.",
        "\"We can discuss a settlement after we reach a permanent ceasefire in Khartoum,\" Burhan said in a live phone interview with Alqahera News, warning that war would spread to the rest of Sudan if a division happens in Khartoum.
