        "Taylor Hawkins' widow Alison was spotted out and about this week in her first public sighting since his death over a year ago.",
        "She was married to Foo Fighters drummer Taylor from 2005 until he died at the age of 50 last March of a cardiovascular collapse, reportedly with a cocktail of drugs in his system.The couple shared three children - Oliver Shane, 16, Annabelle, 13, and Everleigh, eight.During her latest outing she cut a casual figure, slipping on a simple white full-sleeved top and a pair of high-waisted black shorts.Alison was accompanied that day by a silver-haired male friend who was seen gallantly opening her car door for her.",
        "Taylor was found dead in his hotel room on March 25 in Bogota, Colombia, where Foo Fighters were scheduled to play the Festival Estereo Picnic that day.\u00a0Shortly thereafter the band, who had been on tour,\u00a0announced they were scrapping the remainder of their concert bookings.'It is with great sadness that Foo Fighters confirm the cancellation of all upcoming tour dates in light of the staggering loss of our brother,' they said in a statement.An autopsy reportedly discovered that at the time of his death his heart weighed about 600 grams, which is double the average for a man his age.\u00a0Taylor's shattered widow mourned him in private with their children, waiting until June to release a statement offering her gratitude to his public.",
        "''My deepest thanks and admiration go out to the global Foo Fighters community and Taylor's fans far and wide for the outpouring of love and each everyone one of you have shown our beloved Taylor,' Alison wrote.'Your kindness has been an invaluable comfort for my family and me during this time of unimaginable grief,' her statement continued.'As Taylor's wife, and on behalf of our children, I want to share how much you meant to him and how dedicated he was to \"knocking your socks off\" during every performance,' she touchingly shared with the fans.",
        "'Taylor was honored to be a part of the Foo Fighters and valued his dream role in the band every minute of his 25 years with them. We consider every band member and the extended Foo Fighters team our family.'In 2001 Taylor suffered a heroin overdose that left him in a coma for a week, throughout which his bandmate Dave Grohl remained by his bedside in London.Taylor declared himself sober in 2018, and in an interview the year before his death he spoke about his 2001 overdose to the UK music magazine Kerrang!.Everyone has their own path and I took it too far. I was partying in London one night, and I mistakenly did something and it changed everything. I believed the bulls*** myth of live hard and fast, die young,' she said.",
        "'I\u2019m not here to preach about not doing drugs, because I loved doing drugs, but I just got out of control for a while and it almost got me. I was heading down a road that was going to lead to even worse paths.'"
