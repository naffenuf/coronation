        "Celebrate the Coronation in clothes that hark back to an era that embraced modesty, femininity and a touch of glamourREAD MORE: JO ELVIN's got red, white and blue Coronation style covered\u00a0Fashion has gone all-out retro crazy \u2014 and that\u2019s great news for this weekend, for there\u2019s no occasion more retro than that of a coronation.",
        "I\u2019m not talking about the recent resurgence in 1990s and 2000s style, either.\u00a0Yes, it looked for a moment like we\u2019d all be celebrating in ripped jeans and bandeau tops, but the style gods have smiled on us with an influx of street-party-ready dresses that hark back a few decades beyond.After seasons of shapeless midis, this summer sees the return \u2014 hallelujah \u2014 of more structured, feminine shapes. Designs that are built for your bust, which cinch you in at the waist, and generally support a more regal posture.\u00a0Designers are having great fun creating elegant curves: A-line skirts, corseted waists and exaggerated peplums, harking back to an era that embraced modesty, femininity and a touch of glamour.On the Spring/Summer catwalks, waists were whittled, skirts swished. But on the High Street, the leaders in this field include LK Bennett, whose kitsch, ladylike designs were made for this moment.\u00a0",
        "Its bright blue-and-white gingham shirtdress (far right) comes with tie-detail sleeves and a flattering, flared midi skirt. It\u2019s worth noting that the brand\u2019s occasion wear now goes up to size 20.Less is more at Samantha Cameron\u2019s Cefinn. The pink shirt-sleeve midi dress (centre) with detachable belt \u2014 great for highlighting that waist \u2014 and striking red stitching is a piece worth investing in. Oh, and as a bonus, it\u2019s machine washable.",
        "If you\u2019re on a budget, make a beeline for Karen Millen (third from right), whose fabulous blue lace midi dress is currently on sale. Scared of spaghetti straps? Simply shoulder-robe a knit cardigan, dahling. Very Royal.And make sure you check out Hobbs\u2019 occasion wear; this red-and-pink full-skirted design (third from left) could be straight off the catwalk at Erdem.To get that retro look, opt for polka dots, stripes, checks or florals \u2014 but don\u2019t succumb to kitsch clich\u00e9s such as Union Jacks, regardless of how fun they are.Save them for tablecloths, bunting and comedy hats, rather than buying a dress you\u2019ll never wear again.Now somebody pass me the Pimm\u2019s!"
