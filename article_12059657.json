        "Former sailors who served on the Royal Yacht Britannia have described themselves as a \u201cband of brothers\u201d as they arrived on the ship for their annual working party as a way to keep the bonds they built in service alive.",
        "More than 50 former \u201cYotties\u201d, as they are affectionately known, will spend much of the week aboard the ship which was in royal service between 1953 and 1997, helping with its upkeep as well as catching up and sharing memories of their time on board.",
        "The vessel is now berthed on the Leith in Edinburgh and run by The Royal Yacht Britannia Trust trust as tourist attraction.At 9.30am on Monday, the Yotties raised their flag onboard to mark the beginning of their four-day work party.Andy Fletcher, who served from 1976 until 1978, shared a memory of the late Queen Elizabeth II from when the ship was decommissioned in 1997.\u201cDecommissioning was dreadful for us in 1997,\u201d he said.",
        "\u201cPeople will have seen the pictures of the late Queen. She was very emotional and it was probably the only time you\u2019ll have seen a tear in the Queen\u2019s eyes on the day (the yacht) was decommissioned.\u201dMr Fletcher paid tribute to the maintenance crews who looked after the yacht and urged anyone who had served aboard to join the association.\u201cIt\u2019s the wealth of stories, the bond that we have.\u201cIn the Navy there was a saying that you don\u2019t have friends in the Navy, you have close acquaintances.\u201cThis ship changes all of that. They are not acquaintances, we\u2019re a band of brothers,\u201d he said, adding thier association is a way to keep the strong \u201cbrotherly\u201d bonds alive.",
        "Robbie Robson served from 1973 to 1982 and has been a \u201cYottie\u201d since 2008.He said he was \u201cvery emotional\u201d the first time he came back on board.\u201cI absolutely loved my time on the ship,\u201d Mr Robson said.\u201cI went down to the mess deck. It was quite emotional because I went down to where I lived and slept for 10 years and put myself in my bunk and I literally cried, it was that emotional.Dave Varns was on board for a year between 1976 and 1977 and said it was an \u201cabsolutely brilliant experience\u201d.",
        "He had lost all contact with the yacht and the yachtsmen until he found the association.\u201cI was made so welcome. We\u2019re a different class, we\u2019re a family,\u201d he said.\u201cNo matter who you spoke to, you would always get a laugh or a smile out of any yachtsman.\u201cThey are just an absolute team.\u201dMr Varns was attending his first working party and said he was sure it would not be his last.\u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be working but it\u2019s now 11 o\u2019clock and we\u2019ve done nothing since half past nine,\u201d he joked.\u201cThat\u2019s the type of work I like!\u201d",
        "Such is the bond between those who served aboard, that Mr Robson has asked Mr Fletcher to scatter his ashes from the Royal Yacht as part of a ceremony they hold for every Yottie who dies.",
        "\u201cWe\u2019ve got a ceremony tomorrow. This means so much to me, I\u2019ve made my family promise that when I do go that my ashes will come up here to be scattered.\u201cI hope it\u2019s my colleague (Andy Fletcher) that is actually scattering my ashes for me,\u201d Mr Robson said.\u201cIt is an emotional thing, that\u2019s the wonderful thing about our association that we\u2019re able to provide that to bereaved families,\u201d Mr Fletcher added."
