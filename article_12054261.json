        "A horse involved in the coronation procession from Westminster Abbey reared backwards into the crowds after it appeared to be spooked.",
        "The incident happened as the Gold State Coach, carrying the King and Queen back to Buckingham Palace, rounded the corner from Whitehall into The Mall.One of the horses behind the carriage began walking backwards before crashing into the barriers which separated the public from the procession route.Military personnel were seen rushing over to help and a stretcher was picked up but it was not needed and no one appeared to be injured.A female police officer appeared to be given assistance from her colleagues, limping away from the area.The procession continued along the The Mall to huge cheers and Charles was seen waving to fans.",
        "The Prince and Princess of Wales followed with William waving and Prince George was seen looking curiously at the thousands cheering.Prince Louis had his face pressed close to the glass while Princess Charlotte looked calmly on."
