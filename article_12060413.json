        "Tony Mowbray praised his Sunderland side\u2019s second-half display after they dramatically sealed a play-off place with a 3-0 win over Preston.",
        "After a rocky opening 45 minutes, second-half goals from Amad Diallo, Alex Pritchard and Jack Clarke at Deepdale meant the Black Cats had done all they could in their quest to try and sneak into the play-off places.That victory proved enough to finish in sixth and claim the final play-off spot after Millwall spectacularly blew a 3-1 lead to lose 4-3 to Blackburn at The Den.Blackburn finished just behind Sunderland in the table, also on 69 points but with an inferior goal difference, while Millwall fell down to eighth after having had matters in their own hands before kick-off.Sunderland will now face Luton over two legs for a place in the final at Wembley, and Mowbray was pleased that his side were able to take charge after a frantic first half.He said: \u201cI felt as though we could come here and control the game.",
        "\u201cI knew we could win at Preston, we\u2019ve won away at West Brom and Norwich \u2013 we\u2019ve been good away from home.\u201cWe started sloppy, but then grew into the game. We were naive and let them have too many chances. It was like a basketball game in the first half.\u201cWe didn\u2019t have harsh words at half-time, but we discussed that we needed to control the game better. We became more confident and, off the back of the first goal, we controlled things. It was a solid performance.",
        "\u201cI always believe we\u2019ve got attacking players at the top of the pitch who are really talented and, if we can get the ball to them around the edge of the box, then we can score.\u201dTravelling Black Cats fans brought incredible energy to Deepdale, but Mowbray admitted there were some injury concerns ahead of their semi-final.\u201cIt\u2019s an incredible scenario to see the people of Sunderland enjoying their football so much,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be awesome being in the semi-finals, we\u2019ve got to be ready for Luton.\u201cAs I sit here now, the conundrum in front of us is really difficult because we\u2019ve got injuries to central defenders, but we have to find another performance.\u201dPreston finished the season in 12th but only six points behind Sunderland and Blackburn, and boss Ryan Lowe admitted key moments across the season as a whole had cost them.Lowe commented: \u201cWe\u2019ve given it a good go but it\u2019s not been today or Sheffield United that\u2019s cost us the play-offs, it\u2019s from games earlier on in the season.\u201cI said about mentality, I don\u2019t mean they\u2019re not giving everything, I mean being savvy and taking the opportunities. We went out all guns blazing and we wanted to have a right good go.",
        "\u201cWe fell short by six points but in the grand scheme of things, it\u2019s not bad. For us and clubs like us, we need to keep building and I think we\u2019re going in the right direction, we just need that little bit extra.\u201cWe\u2019re pleased with what we\u2019ve tried to do and where we are. The effort of the players and the staff, they\u2019ve been excellent.\u201cI want to bring the good times back to this club. We are slowly but surely trying to get there, but our aim is to do what Sunderland have done today and get into those play-offs.\u201d"
