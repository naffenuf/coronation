        "Louise Thompson showed off shocking before and after pictures of her house clear-out on Sunday.\u00a0 \u00a0",
        "The Made In Chelsea star, 33, shares a son, Leo-Hunter, 18 months, with her fianc\u00e9 Ryan Libbey.\u00a0She has been open and honest about her struggles with her health since she nearly died in childbirth, leaving her with PTSD.\u00a0Louise showed she was having a very productive bank holiday weekend on Sunday as she attempted a full-scale clear-out of her bedroom, leading to some very dramatic results.\u00a0She showed her 1.4 million followers an insight into the task ahead, filming a sneak peak of the 'before' challenge.\u00a0",
        "The bedroom was filled with piles of clothes and suitcases, completely swamping the floor.\u00a0\u00a0Louise wrote on her Instagram story: 'Next challenge. Because LOL if you thought I was one of those 'influencers' with a boring pristine house. Ohhh noooooo.'\u00a0After a five-hour gap between posts and undertaking the mammoth task all on her own, a victorious Louise shared an update.The new room looked unrecognisable, with a spotless carpet and freshly-made bed.The reality star said:\u00a0'Ok I'm just gonna say it. I feel like a total rockstar', giving the camera a thumbs up and making a fist pump.\u00a0She added: 'Single-handedly in one day. Sore hands and feet but I will sleep like a baby tonight.'\u00a0At the end of March Louise\u00a0took to Instagram to give an emotional update about her health as she\u00a0continues to battle with PTSD and postnatal anxiety.",
        "The star\u00a0nearly died when she gave birth to son Leo in November 2021\u00a0and she has been struggling with her health ever since.",
        "Sharing a moving clip of both good and bad moments from the past few months, Louise gave fans an update on how she's coping, adding that something happened last weekend to cause a downward spiral.\u00a0She wrote: 'Does anyone else feel like they\u2019re in season 5 of their life and the writers are making ridiculous s**t happen to keep the script interesting?'I know Instagram is merely a snapshot of everyone\u2019s life, but man my world has been mad. It\u2019s just felt so messy.\u00a0Medical issues have compounded every. single. month. and I\u2019ve only just started processing the early stuff.\u00a0'Now that I\u2019m going through the timeline with my trauma therapist things seem to be getting a bit harder again. Urgh. She did say that things might get a bit harder before they get better, but I didn\u2019t think that would actually apply to me.\u00a0I never thought any of these problems would apply to me.\u00a0Referring to the video she posted on Instagram, Louise continued: 'In fact I even found looking over this reel a bit triggering. How can that be? It seems so silly. It\u2019s hard to find the patience.\u00a0",
        "'To be honest if I were to create a REAL reel of the last 16 months it would be at least an hour long\u2026 there would be hospital appointments every single week, 50+ blood tests and it would be far too painful to make/watch.\u00a0'I\u2019m just dipping my toe in to find some positive nuggets to hold close to my heart at this stage.'She continued: 'Re: therapy - it\u2019s the same, we\u2019re really just looking at an overview\u2026 starting to scratch the surface and focus on dates of significant events (there seem to be too many) and i\u2019m finding it hard not to deep dive.",
        "'In terms of health\u2026 Gynaecology, gastroenterology, rheumatology, psychiatry, psychotherapy and now haematology appointments, what next? That is six different departments that I\u2019m working with every month. It\u2019s hard to step away from health with all this going on.\u00a0'The mad things is that I didn\u2019t have any issues before all of this. Yes I suffered with mild inflammatory bowel disease but I didn\u2019t need to medicate for 4 years and I\u2019d never even got as far as steroids. Isn\u2019t it crazy how your life can change overnight?\u00a0'I mean i\u2019m only just realising how nuts it is that last July I was told it might be better to have my colon removed. One day I\u2019m on holiday, the next day i\u2019m in A&amp;E with that news. Gosh we so take our health for granted.",
        "'So here lies a short snapshot, and a reminder for ME that things HAVE got better, and for YOU, that things CAN get better too. (I had to change that from a WILL to a CAN because life can be uncertain).\u00a0'So I guess the overriding main message is, keep going!!! Keep plodding on. Good moments will outshine the bad. You will learn to cope.\u2063 And ask for help! \u2764\ufe0f\u200d.'\u00a0On working with a life coach and therapist, she wrote: 'When I started working with my life coach again (I worked with her during the first lockdown and then picked up with her again mid way through last year) she mentioned that she felt that I had lived many lives. That I was an old soul. I am quite spiritual, so I felt that.\u00a0'I believe that I am currently living the most challenging chapter of my life - It\u2019s like i\u2019ve logged onto the hard level\u2026 but hopefully, like the seasons, this level will pass. Everything always passes.\u00a0'These thoughts and feelings seem to be taking a damn long time to process\u2026 I\u2019m actually very bored by how much time they are taking time to shift\u2026 but eventually they will diminish into something totally insignificant\u2026 like that stick diagram with the little man and the big circles that get smaller over the years. I\u2019ll reference it on my stories.\u00a0",
        "'In fact some days I have are totally 100% normal. Like yesterday\u2026 and the day before. It\u2019s only when I reflect back (like I do in therapy) that I realise that this is a HUGE improvement.'"
