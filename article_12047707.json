        "Eat your heart out, Top Gun.",
        "The U.S. Navy has chosen a particularly unexpected approach to the current military staffing crisis \u2013 and it\u2019s sparked an all-out war.Former Navy SEAL Robert J. O\u2019Neill, who took part in the 2011 mission to kill Osama Bin Laden, hit out on Twitter at the Navy\u2019s recent decision to hire an active-duty drag queen to boost recruitment.\u2018China is going to destroy us\u2026 I can\u2019t believe I fought for this bull****,\u2019 O\u2019Neill raged over the November appointment of non-binary Yeoman 2nd Class Joshua Kelley, who moonlights as cross-dressing performer \u2018Harpy Daniels\u2019.And can you blame him?The Navy says the Digital Ambassador program \u2013 a pilot scheme which has since ended \u2013 was an attempt \u2018to attract the most talented and diverse workforce.\u2019Excuse me \u2013 the most talented?O\u2019Neill and his team seemed to manage fine without wigs, fake breasts and garish makeup. What an insult!",
        "Now, of course, our servicemen are welcome to do whatever they like for entertainment in their free time \u2013 no matter how tacky I may personally find their choice of pastime. But this seems a particularly misguided attempt by Navy bosses to address staffing problems, which cannot be overstated.The Navy already expects to fall short of its current fiscal year recruitment target by 6,000.",
        "And it\u2019s not just sailors. All our armed forces are suffering from denuded ranks.The Army will likely miss its hiring goal this year by 10,000. Last year they fell short by a shocking 15,000.Why? There are numerous cultural conditions which mean young Americans are less likely than ever to join the military.Not least among them is the shameful fact that, as a study by the Pentagon found last year, 77 per cent of 17 to 24-year-olds would fail to qualify for service because they are overweight, abuse drugs, or suffer from mental and physical health problems.Some experts have also pointed to the Biden administration\u2019s botched withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan in August 2021 \u2013 during which 13 U.S. servicemen died \u2013 as a demotivating factor.Meanwhile, patriotism is at an all-time low among woke millennials and Gen-Z.Just 25 per cent of citizens aged 18 to 34 say they are \u2018extremely proud\u2019 to be an American, compared to 51 per cent of people aged 55 and over, according to polling firm Gallup.",
        "In other words, the U.S. military \u2013 the very thing that secures our place as the leader of the free world \u2013 is facing a full-blown existential crisis.And yet, top brass would seemingly rather spend their brain power \u2013 and public cash \u2013 virtue signaling by pinning their colors to the latest ultra-liberal fad.",
        "How pathetic.These are the men and women charged with our protection. Who are supposed to rise above the cultural noise and make confident, well-judged decisions in the national interest \u2013 not the interests of a tiny, but vocal minority.The Left might have you believe that \u2018queer\u2019 identification is the new normal. But it\u2019s not.Still only 5 per cent of adults under 30 \u2013 surely the most progressive \u2013 identify as transgender or non-binary.And how many of them, would you guess, are likely to want to serve in the military?It doesn\u2019t take a genius with decades of experience in complex battlefield strategy to see that something doesn\u2019t add up here.So the question has to be asked: who on Earth is making these marketing decisions?Is it the same over-paid bosses who have recently dragged our armed forces into disrepute over repeated embarrassments on the international stage?",
        "I mean the Afghanistan withdrawal, the current debacle over the evacuation of Americans from war-torn Sudan, the recent Pentagon intelligence leaks.It\u2019s no wonder young Americans don\u2019t want to entrust their lives to these people\u2019s care.This hasn\u2019t emerged from a vacuum.Consider the recent rows over so-called \u2018Drag Queen Story Hours\u2019 for children in libraries, dangerous puberty blocking drugs for minors, the new corporate obsession with \u2018Diversity, Equality and Inclusion\u2019 in the workplace \u2013 or even the Bud Light fiasco which saw the company\u2019s stock price tank after partnering with TikTok trans activist Dylan Mulvaney.",
        "That all makes the Navy\u2019s decision to hire Joshua Kelley even more tone-deaf.Politically divisive issues should have no place in matters of national security.Indeed, one would hope that our military leaders are less concerned with fighting the culture wars than holding off the threat from terrorist states.But somewhere along the way, the aptitude for sound judgment has been eroded.Last June, the Navy came under fire after releasing a risible training video urging sailors to create \u2018safe spaces\u2019, and use \u2018inclusive language\u2019 and \u2018preferred pronouns\u2019.The year before, it had emerged that the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York, was offering trainees an elective course focusing on critical race theory, named \u2018Politics of Race, Gender, and Sexuality\u2019.",
        "But people are losing patience with this kind of petty politicking. And, if the Navy truly hope to tackle their flagging recruitment, they would do well to take heed of the Mulvaney row.Bud Light executives are learning the true meaning of \u2018go woke, go broke\u2019, as sales have continued to plummet since hiring the controversial TikToker. There was a staggering 26 per cent decline in the final week of April \u2013 and overall sales for the year are down 8 per cent.In a groveling call to investors on Thursday, Bud Light CEO Michel Doukeris was forced to row back on the misguided partnership, claiming it was \u2018not a campaign\u2019.",
        "So, as the battle against Russia in Ukraine drags on, and the cold war for supremacy with China reaches new heights, it\u2019s time to get some priorities straight.A congressional war game last month prompted calls for \u2018decisive action\u2019 after a simulated Chinese invasion of Taiwan proved the U.S. was wholly unprepared for such a conflict.Before it\u2019s too late, we must cut the woke posturing and focus on what our suffering armed forces sorely need."
