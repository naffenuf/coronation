        "Miami-based company JetCarUSA sells and rents models of the vessel\u00a0The rental company says: 'JetCar isn't a jet ski. JetCar sits in a class of its own!\u2019READ MORE:\u00a0The 10 most annoying things that people do on holiday revealedCross a jet ski with a car and this is the result.",
        "Incredible 'JetCar' watercraft that resemble Corvette sports cars are available to rent from Miami-based\u00a0JetCarUSA, which claims they can hit\u00a056 knots (65mph).With their glossy paintwork and open-topped roofs, these two-seater vessels look like something from a James Bond film.They cost $350 (\u00a3277) per hour to rent, or around $55,500 (\u00a344,000) to buy.The 'JetCar' features an onboard music system with Bluetooth function and \u2018premium speakers\u2019 so you can \u2018enjoy your favourite songs while cruising through the waters in style\u2019.",
        "The fibreglass hull of the car-shaped vessel comes in a range of colours, from sky blue to orange and bright pink.Buyers can choose to add a range of mod-cons to the vessel, such as interior LED lighting, cup holders and a GPS tracking system. They can also take their pick from several engine types, from a 180-horsepower Yamaha engine to a 300-horsepower\u00a0Sea-Doo engine.\u00a0The manufacturers say: \u2018JetCar isn't just a boat, JetCar isn't a jet ski. JetCar sits in a class of its own!\u2019",
        "Life vests and a fire extinguisher are stored on board, and the vessel can be monitored by 'chase boats' to ensure that passengers have a 'safe, fulfilling time' behind the wheel, JetCarUSA says.\u00a0A recent model, a 15ft- (4.5m) long vessel based on a Corvette C8 sports car, went up for auction earlier this year on the site\u00a0Boats &amp; Buyers, but it wasn\u2019t sold.",
        "The auction site\u2019s listing says: \u2018Unlike a jet ski, the JetCar is much more stable and easy to balance, even in rough waters. The responsive steering system makes it easy to control and manoeuvre, allowing you to navigate through tight turns and make quick stops with ease.\u2018But don't let its ease of use fool you \u2013 the JetCar is also incredibly fast and powerful, allowing you to reach exhilarating speeds on the water.\u2019\u00a0",
        "YouTuber Brandon Jordan shared a video that shows him getting pulled over by the police while driving a JetCar on the water.\u00a0The police can be seen quizzing him about what sort of watercraft the JetCar is, only for Brandon to reply: \u2018Basically it's just a big old jet ski, just like a really weird shape.\u2019After checking the paperwork Brandon held for the vessel, they moved on. \u2018They were super nice, super respectful,\u2019 he tells the camera in the clip.Reflecting on the company's business plan, JetCarUSA's owner Naquan Robinson told\u00a0Lootpress:\u00a0'You won\u2019t find anything else on the market right now quite like this.'Every corner of the United States matters to us. The public loves them, the market has spoken. It\u2019s just a matter of getting them out there.'"
