        "Shell became the latest oil giant to post bumper profits as it raked in a record \u00a37.7billion in the first quarter of the year.",
        "As the industry faced fresh allegations of \u2018profiteering\u2019, it cashed in, with strong energy trading offsetting a fall in oil and gas prices.The haul was a record for the first quarter and \u00a31.4billion better than analysts expected, lifting shares 0.9 per cent, or 20p, to 2345.5p.Five of the world\u2019s biggest oil companies \u2013 Shell, BP, Equinor, Exxon Mobil and Chevron \u2013 have posted quarterly profits of more than \u00a335billion in recent days.",
        "They have triggered huge rewards for investors in the form of share buybacks and dividends.\u00a0Shell will return \u00a39.6billion to investors in the first half \u2013 \u00a33.2billion of dividends and \u00a36.4billion of buybacks \u2013 but it has been accused of a \u2018profiteering bonanza\u2019 and doling cash out to shareholders instead of investing in green energy.Chief executive, Wael Sawan, hailed \u2018strong results and robust operational performance against a backdrop of ongoing volatility\u2019.\u00a0The price of Brent crude oil averaged $81 a barrel in the first quarter, below the $96 in the same period of 2022. It is now at just above $70.Although this hit margins, Shell offset it with an improved performance from its trading team and lower running costs.\u00a0This week, BP also posted a \u00a34billion profit for the first quarter, thanks to lower refining costs and stellar oil and gas trading.\u00a0",
        "And it plans \u00a33.2billion of buybacks a year, based on current forecasts.",
        "But these profits and buybacks have reignited calls from environmental groups and politicians for a bigger windfall tax on a sector accused of profiting from Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.Britons\u2019 energy bills have rocketed during the past 18 months as millions struggle to afford food, heating and other necessities.Branding the profits \u2018obscene\u2019, the Unite union said Shell has joined BP \u2018in continuing the profiteering bonanza\u2019.Sharon Graham, the union\u2019s general secretary, said: \u2018The scale of profiteering by Shell and BP is one of the corporate scandals of our times. And this is practically untouched by Rishi Sunak\u2019s so-called windfall tax.\u2019Last year, the Government introduced the energy profits levy to help fund support for families.Shell paid \u00a3108million in UK taxes, while BP paid \u00a3583million. In January, this was raised from a 25\u00a0per cent to 35\u00a0per cent tax on profit from North Sea oil and gas producers, taking the effective rate to 75 per cent.\u00a0Firms can offset the tax by investing in oil and gas extraction in the North Sea, bringing in extra supplies.But Joseph Evans, researcher at think-tank IPPR, said: \u2018Shell\u2019s profits soar while households suffer. Instead of using the profits productively, like investing in the green transition, they\u2019ve decided to hand this excess cash straight to their shareholders.\u00a0",
        "\u2018It is time the Government started taxing excessive payments to shareholders. A share buyback tax could bring in billions every year.\u2019But some have warned that risks cutting investment as the UK seeks to beef up energy security.",
