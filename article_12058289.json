        "A new teaser of Yellowjackets season 2, episode seven titled, Burial, was unveiled during the 2023 MTV Movie &amp; TV Awards on Sunday, hinting at plenty of explosive arguments and even a bit of fist throwing.\u00a0",
        "The popular Showtime series, which received two nominations at the ceremony including Best Show and Best Performance in a Show, premiered its second season earlier this year in March, with new episodes airing every Friday.\u00a0The annual awards show was thrown into chaos due to the current Writers Guild of America strike which prompted some celebrities to not make appearances and host, Drew Barrymore, to drop out.\u00a0However, a minute-long teaser clip was shown during the pre-taped ceremony, hinting at what fans can expect from episode seven, which will premiere on May 14.\u00a0At the very beginning, the surviving Yellowjackets could be seen huddled near a fire indoors, with Teen Misty, played by Samantha Hanratty, standing up and humming to the track, Lightning Crashes, by artist Live.\u00a0",
        "Teen Shauna, played by Sophie Nelisse, strolled to the other side of the room, only to come to a crashing halt when she heard the tune.\u00a0She slowly turned around and asked Misty, 'Why are you singing that?' The camera slowly zooms in on Misty's face, as she remains silent in slight confusion.\u00a0Shauna demanded once again with less patience, 'Where did you hear that song?' The clip then jumped to years later with the adult versions of the characters dancing happily to the track, played by Christina Ricci (Misty) and Melanie Lynskey (Shauna).\u00a0",
        "The teaser then transitioned back to the past, with Teen Misty answering with, 'I don't know. I think that Crystal was singing it.'Within seconds, Shauna stormed across the room, punching Misty directly in the face, causing her to nearly fall over. Just as the punch sounded on the screen, Christina Ricci's voice yelled, 'Oh my God you guys, is it snowing?' jumping back to the future.\u00a0The adult versions of the characters could be seen showing excitement as they prepared to look at the snowfall.\u00a0The teaser then cut back to Shauna emotionally yelling, 'You killed my f***ing baby!' with two other Yellowjackets trying to hold her back away from Teen Misty. In the previous episode, Shauna had tragically lost her baby boy, mainly due to malnutrition.Nat stepped in the middle, adamantly telling Shauna, 'Stop! Misty did everything that she could!'",
        "Still mourning the loss of her child, Shauna fired back, 'Oh shut up!' and accused other Yellowjackets of eating her baby. 'I saw you. You were covered in blood!'\u00a0At the end of the explosive clip, Teen Lottie then stepped in the middle, only prompting Shauna to throw another punch as well, the sound echoing around the survivors and ending the teaser.\u00a0Showtime's Yellowjackets has received critical acclaim and a devote following from viewers and fans since the first season premiered in November 2021.\u00a0",
        "The second season began airing earlier this year in March, with a new episode dropping every Friday. The plot follows the Yellowjackets, a soccer team that was flying to Seattle but crashed in Canada in 1996.\u00a0The survivors then had to learn to survive in the wilderness, with episodes jumping to the future to show the adult version of the characters who are still coping from the trauma.\u00a0The premise of season two follows, 'The Yellowjackets barely made it through summer in the woods, but now as winter begins to bite, we\u2019ll see if hunger and desperation turn into full-on psychosis,' according to an official synopsis.\u00a0",
        "Since its release, the thriller has garnered several Emmy nominations, and recently received two nominations at the 2023 MTV Movie &amp; TV Awards, which aired on May 7.\u00a0The series received nods for Best Show, which was awarded to HBO's The Last Of Us, and Best Performance in a Show for Christina Ricci. However, the win went to Jenna Ortega for her portrayal in Netflix's Wednesday.\u00a0MTV jumped to its own Twitter page to share the teaser, and added the caption, 'Snow is falling, fists are flying, and everything is juuust fine in this exclusive clip from episode seven of #Yellowjackets.'\u00a0The second season contains nine episodes and will soon come to an end later this month. However, late last year in December 2022 , Yellowjackets was renewed for a third season.\u00a0\u00a0",
