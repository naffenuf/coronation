        "Survey reveals junctions that catch most drivers that go through red lights'Amber gamblers' could be racking up fines of almost \u00a3500,000 per yearA map of Britain\u2019s \u2018ambler gambler\u2019 hotspots has been revealed - with a set of traffic lights in Sheffield taking the number one spot for motorists jumping the red light.",
        "And it has been found that offenders who are caught could be racking up fines of almost \u00a3500,00 per year.\u00a0A survey, conducted by police forces, has revealed the worst junction in the county\u00a0was the A61 Upper Hanover Street, in Sheffield, close to the city's university, a survey of police forces found.\u00a0It was also found that the\u00a0A322 at Bracknell -\u00a0\u00a0which is a well known 'rat run' for drivers hoping to avoid part of the M25 by going cross-country between the M4 to the M3 - was the second most dangerous intersection in the UK.This comes after officers rigged cameras on dozens of sets of traffic lights up and down the country in a bid to stop people racing through after lights have changed.",
        "This camera system technology means that it is able to recognise a vehicle's registration plate if they go through after the lights have turned red.",

        "Anybody caught\u00a0can be slapped with a \u00a3100 fine and three penalty points on their licence.\u00a0Although, first offenders may be offered the chance to avoid the points if they pay for a driver re-education course.It should be noted that\u00a0getting 12 points or more within a three-year period usually results in a minimum driving ban of six months.\u00a0The survey, which was conducted by police forces, has listed the junctions that catch the most drivers who dice death by speeding past the lights after they have turned red.\u00a0\u00a0",
        "The top ten sites are all around the country and include busy road junctions in London, Cardiff, Leicester, Liverpool and Bristol.Other sites that snared a high number of drivers were the Junction 2 off slip road from the M25, the A270 Old Shoreham Road, near Brighton and the Aigburth Road, in Merseyside.It has been estimated that in the last year, around\u00a055,000 drivers were caught by red light cameras. Of these, around 35,000 opted for a course, 10,000 accepted a fine and the remainder ended up in court.Neil Greig, Director of Policy and Research at the Institute of Advanced Motorists (IAM) RoadSmart, said: 'These cameras are set to catch drivers who have passed the red light well after it illuminates. They are not amber gamblers but deliberate risk takers putting themselves and others in danger.'These systems are mainly installed at junctions with a history of red light running-related crashes, so they are not there to rake in fines but instead to save lives.\u00a0'It is incredibly selfish behaviour to ignore a stop light and cause a side impact crash which are among the least survivable, even in a modern car with airbags and other crash protection features.'"
