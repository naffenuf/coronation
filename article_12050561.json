        "ST GALLEN, Switzerland, May 5 (Reuters) - Swiss National Bank Chairman Thomas Jordan said on Friday that he could not rule out further monetary tightening, saying inflation remained a concern.",
        "Speaking at a symposium at the University of St Gallen, Jordan said inflation continued to exceed the central bank's target range.\"We cannot exclude that it will again be necessary to further tighten monetary policy,\" Jordan said.While Swiss inflation is considerably lower than in many countries where it has reached double digits, it has been overshooting the SNB's 0%-2% target for 14 months, prompting the central bank to raise rates at its last four quarterly meetings.Data earlier on Friday showed annual inflation slowed to 2.6% in April from 2.9% in March, more than forecast, but still well above the central bank's target range.(Reporting by Noele Ilien Editing by Tomasz Janowski)"
