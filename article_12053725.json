        "Earlier this week, the 14-year-old who\u00a0targeted the South Sydney star with racial abuse in Penrith\u00a0in March was banned from attending NRL games until he has apologised to Mitchell.The New South Wales fullback was abused as he walked off the field at half-time during Souths' 16-10 loss to Penrith on March 9.\u00a0The teenager received widespread condemnation but,\u00a0according to the Sydney Morning Herald, he is disputing the allegation his slur was racially motivated.An outspoken supporter of Indigenous Australians, Mitchell wears his heritage proudly on his sleeve and said he won't be deterred by racial abuse.",
        "'A lot of people would love for me to stand in line and shut my mouth, but I won\u2019t do that,' he told the Daily Telegraph.\u00a0'I will always stand up for my heritage, for my culture and being a voice for all Australian kids.'It\u2019s about time we rubbed racism out of our game and out of our sports. Even in the AFL, the poor fellas cop it there.'I will support anyone who gets racially abused or vilified. It\u2019s all about us moving forward and growing as a game.'Following the incident against Penrith, in an emotional press conference\u00a0Souths boss Jason Demetriou called for the NRL to take a zero-tolerance stance against racism.",
        "Demetriou said\u00a0anyone found guilty of using racist language to be banned for life\u00a0from attending NRL games, adding the ban should be extended to the parents if the perpetrator is under age.And Mitchell said the ban imposed on the fan will set an important precedent for NRL fans.\u00a0'I left it [dealing with the incident] to the NRL and the integrity unit, they\u2019ve acted, and hopefully there\u2019s a lesson from it,' he said.",
        "'All I want out of this is that there\u2019s a strong message to be sent to people who think racism is OK in our game and in society. It\u2019s not.\u00a0'There should be repercussions and accountability.'I\u2019m also here to say that I hope this is a message to all rugby league fans sitting in the crowd that if there is racism, then call it out and feel it\u2019s OK to do so.'If you want to be racist, you keep your f***ing opinions to yourself.\u00a0'I can say this. I won\u2019t be changing.'",
        "As it finalised its investigation on Wednesday, the NRL indicated the fan will also have to\u00a0completed education and training programs facilitated by the league before being allowed back at games.'The NRL confirmed today it had issued a notice intending to ban a spectator from attending NRL events until such time as the young person can establish that sufficient steps have been taken to address their behaviour,' an NRL statement read.",
        "'These steps will include apologising and completing appropriate training and education in respectful behaviour and cultural awareness.'The NRL thanks Latrell Mitchell for reporting this matter and reaffirms that no form of vilification will be tolerated in rugby league.'"
