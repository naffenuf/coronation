        "Steven MacLean is confident St Johnstone are up for the battle after being sucked back into relegation trouble in recent months.",
        "The Perth side looked comfortable in mid-table in February but a poor run of form \u2013 which cost manager Callum Davidson his job last month \u2013 has allowed clubs beneath them to close the gap.Saints \u2013 who survived via a play-off last season \u2013 go into their post-split fixtures six points ahead of last-placed Ross County and only two points ahead of joint-second-bottom pair Dundee United and Kilmarnock.Defeat at home to resurgent United on Saturday could leave the McDiarmid Park side sitting in the relegation play-off spot, but interim manager MacLean feels they can take encouragement from the fact they are still \u201cin the driving seat\u201d.\u201cI think they are, I think they know that,\u201d he said when asked if the Saints players were fully aware of the gravity of their predicament.\u201cThe players know they are in a battle. All we\u2019re concentrating on is ourselves right now. We know what we\u2019ve got to do. We\u2019re in the driving seat, it\u2019s in our own hands. We\u2019re not really looking towards other teams.\u201d",
        "MacLean was handed the reins two and a half weeks ago after the sacking of Davidson. The 40-year-old oversaw a 1-1 draw at home to Hibernian in his first game in charge and \u2013 with no fixture last weekend \u2013 he arranged a \u201ccompetitive\u201d friendly against his former club Hearts last Friday to keep his squad ticking over.",
        "MacLean is relishing his first taste of management but insists there is no update with regard to the longer-term managerial situation at Saints.Asked if he had any further discussions about his position, MacLean said: \u201cNo, I\u2019m just in charge until I\u2019m told not to be.\u201cI\u2019m enjoying it. It\u2019s hard work. It\u2019s something that\u2019s always been in the back of mind that I wanted to do. I\u2019m just really concentrating on the next five games.\u201cDundee United is first so I\u2019m just looking at that and putting all my thoughts into that and having the players focused.\u201cThe boys have been excellent. They\u2019ve done everything I\u2019ve asked of them and more.\u201d"
