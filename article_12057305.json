        "ATLANTA (AP) - Michael Harris II couldn't wait to get into the batter's box after the Baltimore Orioles chose to intentionally walk Marcell Ozuna and pitch to him.",
        "\"I was having some good at-bats all game,\" Harris said. \"So to see them walk Ozuna and want to have to face me, it kind of put a fire in my you-know-what. I got up there first pitch and tried to hit something hard and I did.\"Harris hit a game-ending double off Cionel P\u00e9rez in the 12th inning, and the Atlanta Braves beat Baltimore 3-2 on Sunday to stop the Orioles' streak of seven consecutive winning series.Braves right fielder Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr. brought a roar from the sellout crowd of 40,800 at Truist Park in the 11th when he caught Adam Frazier\u00b4s 322-foot flyout and made a one-hop throw to third baseman Austin Riley, who tagged Austin Hays for a double play.\"When you're playing defense you're doing everything you can to keep the other team from scoring runs,\" Acu\u00f1a said via a translator. \"Obviously that's what happened. I'm always anticipating for the runners to go so I just try to make the throw, make the play and they get themselves out, I guess.\"Harris' fly off P\u00e9rez (1-1) scored Ozzie Albies as the Braves won two of three from Baltimore, which lost consecutive games for the first time since April 8-9.",
        "\"Just two tough games,\" Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. \"I thought we really fought well, played hard. We had opportunities today and let a few get away unfortunately.\"",

I called them annoying the other day. Their bats are so good from top to bottom and that bullpen is really, really good.\"Baltimore\u00b4s Tyler Wells gave up one run and three hits in five innings.Matt Olson hit his 10th homer, an opposite-field shot to left in the first that sailed 413 feet.\"That's a great lineup and a really good club,\" Hyde said. \"We had a chance to win last night and chance to win multiple times today, so we're obviously disappointed.\"Ram\u00f3n Ur\u00edas had an RBI groundout in the fourth and Anthony Santander's run-scoring single gave Baltimore a 2-1 lead in the 10th. Sam Hilliard scored on F\u00e9lix Bautista's wild pitch in the bottom half.",
