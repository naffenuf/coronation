        "A women\u2019s football team arrived for their final home game of the season only to find a bouncy castle had been put up on it as part of coronation celebrations.",
        "Colney Heath Ladies were meant to play their last home game against Bowers &amp; Pitsea Ladies on Sunday, on a pitch they regularly use at Colney Heath FC, in the Hertfordshire village.However, players were surprised to find the bouncy castle on the pitch, which organisers refused to move.Players had to play on a different pitch at the venue, which resulted in a \u201csour end\u201d to their league campaign.\u201cWe were aware of the fact that there was an event happening, but we didn\u2019t know that it would be to the effect that we wouldn\u2019t be able to use the pitch\u201d, a club spokesperson, who did not wish to be named, told the PA news agency.This resulted in a \u201csour end\u201d to the ladies team\u2019s tenure at the ground, the spokesperson said.",
        "\u201cWhile there was another pitch we could use, it doesn\u2019t meet our league rules and regulations.\u201cWe totally get that the club want to engage with the community and want to celebrate a national event, but there was ample space and other spaces where they could have put this bouncy castle.\u201d We would like to apologise for the unfortunate events that unfolded yesterday  Colney Heath FC statement  The spokesperson added that they asked people on the site to deflate the bouncy castle and move it elsewhere, which they refused.",
        "The spokesperson added: \u201cThere\u2019s a massive glass ceiling at the minute because when we went there (Colney Heath) we were just one team, and now we\u2019ve grown and developed and have a reserves team.\u201cBut there\u2019s only so much that can happen at that area, so we\u2019re trying to develop both teams by finding a place for the first team to move to, which allows the reserves team to have the potential to develop and grow themselves.\u201cWe only reacted like we did to help women\u2019s football so others can continue to enjoy it.\u201dThe spokesperson said they had hoped the match would be a \u201cbig\u201d event \u2013 but it is \u201cnow being remembered for all the wrong reasons\u201d.Colney Heath FC issued a statement on Monday, apologising to the club.\u201cWe would like to apologise for the unfortunate events that unfolded yesterday\u201d, it said.\u201cThis was all a misunderstanding, as we believed our communication with the ladies team was that they were allocated the second pitch, as we had a community event which had been scheduled since the coronation weekend was announced.\u201cColney Heath FC are fully supportive of everyone participating in all kinds of sports.\u201d"
