        "Melbourne, Sydney,\u00a0Adelaide, Canberra\u00a0and Hobart were in the grips of a cold front over the weekend with temperatures struggling to get past 14C anywhere in Australia's south-east.Snow and hail blanketed parts of Victoria, NSW and the ACT, where overnight temperatures dipped below zero.Temperatures plummeted below the May average by as much as 5C in NSW,\u00a08C in South Australia and\u00a010C in Tasmania.Ski resorts welcomed falls of fresh powder a month out from the the start of ski season.NSW and Victoria remain in the firing line on Monday as cold and gusty southerly winds smash the coast.Overnight temperatures in Sydney plunged as the mercury dipped\u00a0to 10.5C at Sydney Airport 4am Monday but the apparent temperature was a chilly 8C as cold winds blasted the Harbour City.Melbourne was also chilly with the mercury plunging to 7.5C at Melbourne Airport.

        "Sydney will reach a top of 18C of Monday but it it will feel much colder due to the blustery winds.\u00a0'We've seen a narrow band of storm wrapping up the coast, which is an equivalent of a category two cyclone,' Channel Seven meteorologist Tony Auden told Sunrise.'Thankfully they're not on the coast but we have a lot of wind over land, warnings for damaging wind gusts up to 100k/h south of Sydney down to Ulladulla with gusty winds up to 50k/h wrapping around up as far as northern NSW and Queensland as well.'Those winds are whipping a huge seas, potentially with wave heights up to 8-9m off NSW coast. As that low moves away, that energy source to move north and away.''We are expecting a fair bit of erosion on beaches and could see inundation in low-lying areas.'",

We could even see frosts get up into parts of Queensland on Monday and Tuesday.'",
        "Mr Narramore described it as 'a sure sign that winter is on its way.'The cold front coming through NSW is expected to form into a low pressure system from Sunday night.",
        "Storm force and gale wind warnings are in place for southern waters including Batemans Coast, Eden Coast and Illawarra.Strong wind warnings are also in place from Sydney up to the mid north coast and Byron.Another cold front is expected to impact Western Australia on Wednesday, bringing with it rain, storms and strong winds, Mr Narramore said.It's expected to bring wet and cold weather to Adelaide on Thursday, before weakening and moving into Victoria and Tasmania.",
