        "Jennifer Lopez was looking fierce in leopard print on Wednesday.\u00a0",
        "The superstar, who has been promoting her new film The Mother, strutted her stuff in a spotted tunic with fringe on the sleeves and cheetah print leggings and heels.She carried a dainty animal print purse and wore her hair in loose, glossy waves that were partially pinned back to showcase her flawless visage.JLo, 53, rocked gold hoop earrings, sunglasses worthy of a pop star, and a perfect face of makeup.She emerged out into the sunshine with a crowd waiting for her, where she flashed a friendly wave.",
        "She dropped three Instagram snaps of her look as she gave her new action film The Mother a shout-out.\u00a0'#THEMOTHER @livekellyandmark @jlobeauty,' she captioned the post. The upcoming Netflix flick sees the Waiting For Tonight singer play an assassin determined to do anything to keep her young daughter, played by Lucy Paez, safe.The official logline for the flick reads: 'A deadly female assassin comes out of hiding to protect the daughter that she gave up years before, while on the run from dangerous men.'While promoting her new film on Wednesday, the actress appeared on Today - where she found some\u00a0time to gush about her husband Ben Affleck.Her mother Guadalupe also made a brief appearance during the interview, sharing that she had always hoped Jennifer and her now-husband, 50-year-old Ben, would get back together after the high-profile couple split in 2004.",
        "'I knew that you would always get back together because I prayed for 20 years,' the doting mother told her daughter while chatting with hosts Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie.The revelation triggered a playful eyeroll and shake of the head from Jennifer as she told Hoda to 'keep going' with the interview.But Guadalupe's prayers were answered almost 20 years later when the couple rekindled their romance in 2021 before tying the knot in 2022.",
        "During the Today interview, Jennifer also gushed about Ben as a 'father figure' to her 15-year-old twins, Max and Emme.'He's a wonderful, wonderful father and father figure to them. He has his own three beautiful children and then there's us and he's fantastic,' Jennifer said.'He really steps up to the challenge of what that is and what that means and they love him. They love him. They appreciate him and so do I.'",
        "Earlier in the interview, the Get Right singer spoke about how love had changed for her a second time round after her life experiences and realizing what was important to her.'I love what I do. I have always said that, but since I had kids, that changed for me. Now, having a family in this way and being married, you start rejiggering everything. What is really important? How much do I want to work?' she said.",
        "The couple met on the set of Gigli in 2001 and started dating shortly after.Sadly they broke off their engagement in 2004, but they rekindled their romance almost 20 years later in 2021. They married last summer.\u00a0\u00a0"
