Rooms can be rented on the property for as much as $36,000 per night.The reason for the long courtship was because Costner was not sure if wanted more kids. The uncertainty even led them to break up for a period prior to their engagement.'Fear kept me from marrying Christine. [She] wanted a child, but I was afraid I couldn't be an effective father.''I woke up and thought, 'Am I going to lose a beautiful woman who is willing to be with me to my very last breath because I am afraid to say yes to a child?' That's all it took. Sometimes you learn the thing you're most afraid of will save your life,' he told Closer Weekly in 2018.Costner told the Daily Telegraph in 2011 that the reason for his four year hiatus from making movies was because of his new family.As a recently as 2020, Costner spoke glowingly about how the couple's relationship strengthened during the Covid-19 pandemic.
