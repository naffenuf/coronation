        "Founder of\u00a0Marylebone Smile Clinic in London said your teeth send a messageREAD\u00a0 MORE:\u00a0I'm a dentist: These four common practices are ruining your teethThey say the eyes are the windows to the soul - but a dental expert says your mouth may actually be a better guide to the kind of persona you project.",
        "Cosmetic dentist Dr Sahil Patel says that the way our teeth are shaped can signal whether we are organised, chaotic, kind or even aggressive.The expert and founder of Marylebone Smile Clinic (marylebonesmileclinic.co.uk) in London revealed that we might not be aware of the message our teeth send across.While oval teeth signal a carefree and outgoing energy, he explained that squared teeth give off a 'masculine and older' vibe.Elsewhere, quirks such as white spots or uneven edges might channel kindness and creativity.\u00a0",
        "'SQUOVAL'",
        "Dr Patel says that this combination could be compared to a classic nail design - with rounded corners but an overall 'element of squareness'.It doesn't send any intense message across, and hence gives off a subtle and calm energy.\u00a0'It suits most personalities and is considered a safe shape for teeth as it does not impute any strong personality effects,' he explained.The dental expert added that, considering most people's facial profiles, 'on average we show sharp angles at the angle of our lower jaw, upper cheek bones and forehead'.'These angles are softened by the nature, shape and level of fat within the skin overlying the bone structure,' he added.Squoval teeth could also suggest traits such as 'sophistication, calmness and affability', he said.",
        "OVAL",
        "Oval teeth, perhaps unsurprisingly, are 'rounded in all dimensions'.It's 'classically is a more feminine and youthful shape for teeth,' Dr Patel says.Because of their association with femininity, they signal charm and send a softer energy, he added, 'which may suit you depending on your facial features'.He said: 'Aesthetically, rounded facial features would suit rounded or ovoid teeth, as pictured in the example.'Oval teeth impute a carefree, positive and outgoing personality.'SQUARE",
        "The dental expert advises that in contrast to oval teeth, square teeth have a 'masculine and older' aesthetic.Because of this, they will give off the appearance of a brute and blunt persona.\u00a0'Over time almost everyone will wear their teeth into a more square looking appearance,' Dr Patel added.'Square teeth is not necessarily a bad thing for everyone, but they are associated with older age due to the effects of tooth wear.'Age-appropriate teeth are becoming a little more popular in recent times due to people wanting a natural aesthetic.'Personality traits of this shape, he said, could include seriousness, maturity and efficiency.TRIANGULAR",
        "'A good starting point is to have a look in the mirror and see what type of facial form and corresponding tooth form you currently have. This is what nature has given you, and nature is usually not far from the best possible combination of features in teeth.'That being said, if you have something you are looking to change or improve, consider where you might fit in with the personality traits, and remember that cosmetic dentists can mix tooth forms together. For example, a squoval tooth form can be made to be more on the ovoid side or more square, whilst still retaining some features of squoval.'Discuss it with a cosmetic dentist you trust so you can be sure you are designing your smile with the right personality traits in mind.'Dr Sahil Patel\u00a0",
        "Dr Patel said triangular teeth were ones that 'seem to flare outwards a lot'.And their unique shape signals a whimsical charm and unique nature.\u00a0He says these are usually 'developmentally normal' and can look great depending on your personality and facial profile'.'Triangular teeth are associated with dominance, creativity, motion, free thinking and quirkiness,' he added.ECCENTRIC FEATURES\u00a0POINTY TEETHDr Patel said that pointy canines are associated with 'masculinity, strength and aggression'. He explained that many of his clients ask for softer, rounder canines to channel a softer vibe.WHITE SPOTSThese developmental defects can give teeth character, Dr Patel advised, as well as show openness, kindness and creativity.\u00a0UNEVEN EDGES'Wavy edges can be a natural feature, or developed with time due to using your teeth as a tool, or an accident,' the expert explained.\u00a0He revealed that while asymmetric features such as chipped or cracked teeth could show 'disorganisation and reduced intelligence', they could also signal creativity and extroversion.\u00a0MAMELONS'This is a technical term for the developmental grooves on the edges of teeth,' Dr Patel said.'They form during our early years, and often wear away by age 21.'In some people it does not wear away, leaving the appearance of wavy or uneven edges. Mamelons could show youthfulness and immaturity as personality traits.'",
        "INCISAL STEPSThis refers to the length difference between the front tooth and the two side teeth.\u00a0'This is normally 0.5-2mm, but is variable across the population,' Dr Patel advised.'An incisal step of 0.5mm would show seriousness and older age, whereas a step of 2mm-plus would show youthfulness and a playful personality.'"
