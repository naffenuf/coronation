        "Chelsea\u2019s new recruits have not been given the opportunity to find the connections necessary to build a winning team, according to Frank Lampard.",
        "The Blues looked incoherent and without a plan in losing meekly 3-1 to Arsenal on Tuesday, a sixth straight loss on a run that has seen them sink to 12th in the Premier League table.Several of the players who were signed in January have failed to make a significant impact, with Mykhailo Mudryk and Noni Madueke in particular big-money buys that have shown only flashes of their talent.Madueke at least netted his first goal for the club in the loss at the Emirates, something Mudryk, who cost \u00a388million despite only having made 44 first-team appearances for Shakhtar Donetsk, is yet to achieve.There has been little consistency in the starting XI, something that was apparent under former boss Graham Potter and has continued into Lampard\u2019s dire interim spell.It has made an unbalanced squad, loaded up on creative talent but with no one to score goals, look even more disjointed on the pitch, with little apparent chemistry. They have scored only twice in their last eight games.Chelsea will drop below Bournemouth should they lose to Gary O\u2019Neil\u2019s side at the Vitality Stadium on Saturday, despite the fact their opponents have spent most of the season battling relegation and were in the bottom three at the start of April.",
        "\u201cThe numbers show you we\u2019re the team that changes its XI the most,\u201d said Lampard. \u201cComing in at this point for me, it\u2019s trying to find the connections and partnerships in the team which are crucial as we all know.",
        "\u201cThe great teams we\u2019ve witnessed over the years, you can pretty much always name connections. Full-backs; Liverpool off the top of my head, the full-backs are absolutely central to what they do.\u201cWhen you\u2019re trying to find that, it\u2019s difficult, and I think it\u2019s important to know that when we\u2019re in a bad run and those things are not settled, it\u2019s very hard to get consistency of what you want.\u201cYou end up searching for it, and that\u2019s probably why people call it a transition. That\u2019s a challenge. In my position as much as we want results, because results will get thrown in your face, we also need to try and find those little connections within the team going forward.\u201cSome of the younger players that have come into the club have maybe not had the opportunity to settle, to feel comfortable within the team, to understand the full-backs are going to overlap them, or the midfield players are going to support them. In my position as much as we want results, because results will get thrown in your face, we also need to try and find those little connections within the team going forward  Frank Lampard  ",
        "\u201cThat is a process, and that needs work. It\u2019s probably work I haven\u2019t been able to do in this role as interim. It feels less in practice about coaching to that degree.\u201dLampard defended Raheem Sterling despite the England forward\u2019s form having totally deserted him during Chelsea\u2019s slide.Sterling, who was the first signing of the club\u2019s whirlwind recruitment drive this season, has not replicated the performances that saw him score 131 goals in seven seasons at Manchester City, en route to winning four Premier League titles and becoming a lynchpin of Gareth Southgate\u2019s national team.He has managed only four league goals since arriving at Stamford Bridge in July.\u201cI\u2019ve spent the last three years talking to all my younger wingers that I work with, showing them videos of Raheem Sterling arriving at the back post, doing defensively the work he does,\u201d said Lampard.",
        "\u201cYou absolutely cannot take that away from him, what he\u2019s done, for Manchester City and England.\u201cWhen you move club, even though everyone on the outside goes \u2018oh what hard work that is, moving from Man City to Chelsea, what a terrible situation\u2019, it does bring around changes in your life.\u201cOf course maybe the form of the team this season has not been great, so there can always be a lot of contributing factors to individual form.",
        "\u201cHe\u2019s got credit in the bank. Keep working, things around him falling more into place, I think with Raheem he\u2019ll show what he\u2019s shown in his career.\u201cWe have a lot of understandable reasons and stories within the squad, the newer younger players, some players who will be moving on. There are a lot of those reasons.\u201d"
