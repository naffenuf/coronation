The champion has not lost to Werder since 2008 and won the first meeting this season 6-1 in November. Bremen is 12th and likely safe from relegation. Elsewhere, third-placed Union Berlin's bid to qualify for the Champions League for the first time continues at Augsburg, and fourth-placed Freiburg hosts Leipzig, a key rival for a Champions League spot. Hertha Berlin is adrift in last place and desperately needs a win against Stuttgart. Borussia Moenchengladbach plays Bochum and Hoffenheim hosts Eintracht Frankfurt.FRANCESecond-placed Marseille travels to Lens just one point above its northern rival in the fight for the second automatic Champions League spot.

Lens has lost just once and won 14 league games at Stade Bollaert-Delelis. Lens will be without suspended midfielder Salis Abdul Samed and injured forward Wesley Sa\u00efd.
