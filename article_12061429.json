What it was, was all those (expletive), those Catholic (expletive), I think.\"Later Monday, Huggins issued a statement saying he \"used a completely insensitive and abhorrent phrase that there is simply no excuse for - and I won\u00b4t try to make one here. I deeply apologize to the individuals I have offended, as well as to the Xavier University community, the University of Cincinnati and West Virginia University.\"As I have shared with my players over my 40 years of coaching, there are consequences for our words and actions, and I will fully accept any coming my way. I am ashamed and embarrassed and heartbroken for those I have hurt. I must do better, and I will.\"",
