        "Water treatment expert\u00a0Gene Fitzgerald\u00a0issued an urgent warning to pet ownersREAD MORE:\u00a0Cat owners could face \u00a3500 fine unless pets are microchipped\u00a0An expert has issued an urgent warning to dog and cat owners over 'harmful' tap water.\u00a0",
        "Gene Fitzgerald,\u00a0who works for Best Osmosis Systems, revealed that the water in our homes could be 'slowly poisoning' our pets.The water treatment expert claimed it might be dangerous for animals because of the elements dissolved in it.Gene, told The Mirror: 'Hard water contains high levels of calcium and/or magnesium. For pets, this can be harmful.'If a dog drinks too much hard water for too long a period, for example, they can develop conditions such as urinary tract and/or bladder infections, cystitis, urinary obstruction, crystalluria and stone formation.",
        "He added that hard water can also cause health issues in animals such as skin problems, as well as digestive and dental issues.\u00a0Although the expert did admit that the UK is known for having some of the best\u00a0tap water\u00a0in the world there are some 'hard water areas'.Therefore it all depends on the tap water where you live, because some types are absolutely fine for pets to drink.\u00a0Offering a solution Gene said removing the harmful substances from hard water can help to keep your pet healthy.\u00a0She suggested that reverse osmosis and distillation softeners are great solutions, but to bare in mind that\u00a0softeners 'contain sodium', which can be 'equally harmful' to pets.Smaller pet with pre existing health conditions are more susceptible to health issues due to hard water.",
        "There are various online tools for checking the level of water hardness in your area.\u00a0\u00a0But the expert suggested that the best thing to do is to provide these types of pets with filtered tap water.\u00a0As water quality varies throughout the UK, it's hard to tell what is the best thing to do.\u00a0If you're worried, you can contact your water company to receive an assessment of your water quality, or speak to a vet.\u00a0"
