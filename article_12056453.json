        "There is no specific fine for a messy car, but it could cause other offencesExperts advise on cutting down on clutter and cleaning exteriors regularly\u00a0Read more: How to fight back against car thieves and their high-tech methods\u00a0Many Britons will admit that their cars are not exactly squeaky clean - from old coffee cups to chocolate wrappers, that spare hairbrush or magazine, it's easy for clutter to build up if a vehicle is used frequently.",
        "But most drivers are not aware that they could be fined for having too messy a car, especially if its exterior and interior are not sufficiently clean as to avoid becoming distracted.Whilst there is no specific fine for having a messy car interior, too much litter could see you slapped with a penalty and three penalty points if you are found to be driving without due care and attention.\u00a0Last year, a 17-year-old learner driver was left in floods of tears\u00a0when her examiner failed her for having tiny\u00a0pencil rubber filings on the carpet underneath the passenger seat of her instructor's car.A vehicle expert has now explained how to avoid a potential fine - or even disqualification for particularly serious offences.\u00a0",
        "Jamie Louram, from Halfords, said: 'Whilst there is no fine for having a messy interior, clutter if bad enough can also fall under the careless driving rule leading to a fine of up to \u00a3100.'As a general rule, keep your car clutter-free to avoid any dangerous situations such as things getting stuck under the brake pedal or blocking your view.'If you do tend to err on the side of messy when it comes to your car, a bin is a great solution.'As well as potentially obscuring a driver's view out of windows or mirrors, litter left lying around could cause a hazard if it becomes trapped underneath the pedals, potentially preventing the vehicle from braking properly.\u00a0",
        "He warned it is vital to keep a vehicle clutter-free, particularly in the footwells and also on the dashboard so nothing inhibits the view out the windshield.As for the outside of a car, drivers can be fined for having dirty windscreens or windows if it obscures the view, and the same goes for wing mirrors.\u00a0Motorists can also receive a \u00a31,000 fine if the digits on a number plate are not clearly displayed - so even if drivers do not clean the outside of their car very often, they must ensure their number plates are cleared of dirt on a regular basis.\u00a0",
        "Mr Louram added in the Express: 'It's crucial to check that your mirrors are clean and clear every time you use your car, as anything that may obstruct your vision will make it dangerous to drive.'Any kind of dirt or grime on the windscreen can be incredibly dangerous as it can impact your view of the road ahead.'In some instances having a dirty windscreen could be seen as careless driving and land motorists with a fine of up to \u00a3100 and points on the license if an accident occurs as a result.'In 2021, images were shared of a car in Clywd, Wales, that was so dirty that an MOT tester refused to work on it.\u00a0",
        "The interior was crammed with litter and clothes, including in the driver's footwell.To avoid messiness spiralling to this point, experts suggest installing a small bin somewhere in the vehicle and even purchasing storage aids such as boot organisers.\u00a0",
