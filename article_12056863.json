        "Mohamed Salah\u2019s 100th goal at Anfield \u2013 among other achievements \u2013 grabbed the headlines but Liverpool defender Virgil van Dijk believes goalkeeper Alisson Becker is more than worthy of similar recognition.",
        "Salah\u2019s solitary strike secured a sixth successive Premier League victory to maintain the Reds\u2019 unlikely push for the Champions League but the 1-0 win was only possible because Alisson brought up a century of clean sheets in the game.In a disappointing season Alisson has been the club\u2019s most consistent player, even taking into account Salah reaching 30 goals for the campaign for the fourth time in six years.Van Dijk, who has not been immune from the struggles which have affected the whole side, recognises that.\u201cHe\u2019s an example for a lot of players, especially goalkeepers. I\u2019m very glad that he\u2019s my goalkeeper and we have been very successful,\u201d said the Netherlands captain.\u201cObviously on the pitch his qualities are there for everyone to see \u2013 his contribution, the saves, the leadership, that\u2019s all very important \u2013 but away from the pitch is just as important, the qualities he has.\u201cHe is a big, big leader in the group and someone a lot of players look up to.\u201cObviously this (100 clean sheets) is for him a big moment and hopefully there are many more to come.\u201dLiverpool,\u00a0who are in talks with former Wolfsburg sporting director Jorg Schmadtke to replace the departing Julian Ward, recorded back-to-back Premier League clean sheets for the first time in two months \u2013 when they had three in a row \u2013 and only the fifth occasion in the whole campaign.",
        " He's an example for a lot of players. I'm very glad that he's my goalkeeper and we have been very successful  Virgil van Dijk on Alisson Becker's importance  Much of that poor record has been down to how the team defends and not Alisson\u2019s performances, which have been generally better than the rest of the squad overall.Van Dijk accepts those failings but believes they have finally started to iron out their issues.\u201cHe is the one who has the highest risk factor in the team as well, if he makes a mistake then it\u2019s a goal,\u201d he added.\u201cIt\u2019s the whole doing it together type of feeling that we feel we have. That\u2019s the basis.\u201cHe would probably say that without the boys in front of him and the midfielders and strikers doing their work, this (100 clean sheets) would not be possible. Everyone is part of it, but he should definitely be proud of it.",
        "\u201cThe last couple of games, the commitment we have shown and the reaction when we lost the ball is very important.\u201cIt\u2019s important to get the ball back, win challenges, and while there\u2019s still room for improvement, winning six games in a row is something that has been unheard of this season.",
        "\u201cBut let\u2019s just keep going and enjoy the moment and take it into next season.\u201dVan Dijk could not, however, fail to recognise the enduring excellence of Salah, who has drawn level with Steven Gerrard as the club\u2019s joint-fifth all-time goalscorer on 186.It is the Egypt international\u2019s relentlessness which sets him apart from most of his contemporaries, having been available for a remarkable 97 per cent of all Premier League and Champions League matches since he joined the club in 2017.\u201cHe is doing it consistently, even when we are struggling he has still found a way to be important for the team,\u201d said the Dutchman.\u201cBeing consistent every three or four days, obviously you can have games where you don\u2019t score but you can reach that level, and also staying fit that\u2019s the most difficult thing to do.\u201cPeople don\u2019t really speak about those kind of things too much, but maybe we should. On top of that, his numbers speak for themselves. In the world we live in nowadays, maybe the respect comes after he has stopped playing.",
        "\u201cBut I don\u2019t think he cares about that anyway. He just wants to keep doing what he\u2019s doing and be important for the club. That\u2019s the main thing.\u201dBrentford\u2019s bid for European football appears to be fading after just two wins in the last nine matches.",
        "\u201cYou need to perform almost perfectly against these top-six sides,\u201d said head coach Thomas Frank.\u201cWe are definitely getting closer, we\u2019ve shown that in the performances and the wins we\u2019ve had so far this season, but you need to be almost perfect to get a point or to win and, unfortunately, we were not quite perfect, but we were close.\u201d"
