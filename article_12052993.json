        "A Charles II Coronation mug made in 1660 is being offered for sale for \u00a355,000 following its discovery last year at a Buckinghamshire car boot sale, when it was reportedly picked up for just a few pounds.The piece \u2013 possibly the first Coronation mug ever made \u2013 is thought to be one of only four in existence.\u00a0Eric Knowles, veteran ceramics expert on the BBC\u2019s Antiques Roadshow, said: \u2018It\u2019s simply a jewel.\u2019The couple who bought it sold it in December for \u00a314,808 via Claydon Auctioneers in Buckingham.\u00a0",
        "But it went on to London antique dealers E&amp;H Manners, who will exhibit the \u2018great rarity\u2019 at The Treasure House Fair from June 22 to 26.Co-director, Errol Manners, said: \u2018We\u2019re hugely excited. It\u2019s a great rarity\u2026 It\u2019s just the icing on the cake that it coincided with the forthcoming Coronation.\u2019Less than four inches high, it was made for drinking a loyal toast to the monarch, who was reinstated on the throne after the death of Oliver Cromwell.At that time, the only potteries that made this type of delftware were in London on the Thames in Southwark. There were about six \u2018pothouses\u2019 there. Of the surviving examples, two are in public collections, including the Museum of London.On May 29 1660, Charles II rode into London in triumph after landing at Dover. Weeks earlier, Parliament had despatched a delegation to Holland to invite him to return to his Kingdom.",
        "Mr Manners said: \u2018Charles was greeted at St George\u2019s Fields by the Lord Mayor of London in Southwark, the borough where our mug was made.\u00a0",
        "A huge procession, formed of the army, the London bands and City dignitaries crossed London Bridge.\u00a0The parade took seven hours to pass, and it was already early evening by the time the King reached Whitehall.\u00a0Charles was greeted by the assembled peers and MPs at the Banqueting House, which had been the scene of his father\u2019s execution 11 years before.\u00a0The Speakers of both houses greeted him with loyal speeches and the MPs queued to kiss his hand\u2026\u2018Whitehall Palace was hastily refurbished, and a new crown commissioned. This, the St Edward\u2019s Crown, is the one that is still used at the Coronation today. King Charles II was crowned at Westminster Abbey on 23 April 1661.\u2019He added that the mug depicts the king in armour, which represented military prowess: \u2018This is from the period, like we\u2019re in now, just before he was officially crowned, but he was still called king.\u2019"
