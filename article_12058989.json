        "But the unfortunate thing about texting is that your blunders can be saved up for future amusement, as well as shown to other people.\u00a0\u00a0DeMilked has collated a selection of screenshots conveying some of the most amusing text conversations from around the world, as well as some of the most embarrassing.The images were shared on the Funny Texts Instagram page, ranging from messages sent to the wrong number to highly questionable chat-up lines.One hopeless romantic sent their love interest a message saying they were 'hot' like the sun only to be shot down with a scathing response that they could be killed if they get too close.",
        "A pair of friends ended up in a squabble over grammar, with one rescinding an invite to the other after they corrected their use of language.One helpful message advised the receiver that the apology intended for their daughter would not suffice, as she was already on her way over with a baseball bat.Meanwhile one sender was probably writhing in their seat after telling their crush they like them - only to be told to send the message on to someone else.Another person was left to use text to express his frustration that he had travelled to India instead of Indiana."
