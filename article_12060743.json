Charles' slimmed-down monarchy is unveiled\u00a0The Government is spending \u00a3240 million on new phone systems for GP surgeries to cut waiting times for appointments.It\u2019s an attempt to end the 8am scramble, when switchboards are jammed with patients desperate to see a doctor.Some practices are overwhelmed by up to 100 calls in the first hour every Monday morning, leaving receptionists unable to cope.Rather than getting an engaged tone, patients will be able to request a call-back. An initial assessment will be carried out to determine whether a face-to-face consultation is really necessary.In emergencies, patients will be told to go straight to A&amp;E. In many non-urgent cases, they will be directed to other medical professionals, including pharmacies and physiotherapists.",
