        "Jordyn Woods attended a wedding with her boyfriend, Karl Towns, at the Cincinnati Museum Center on Sunday.\u00a0",
        "The 25-year-old socialite - who\u00a0recently stoked the feud with her ex-BFF Kylie Jenner - put on an elegant display in a red back-lace chiffon gown with ruffled shoulders.\u00a0The Life of Kylie star wore her caramel tresses parted in the middle and cascading down in waves as she attended the wedding of one of Karl's former University of Kentucky coach's daughter.\u00a0Karl played for the Wildcats before being drafted into the NBA\u00a0in 2015 by the Minnesota Timberwolves.He has remained close friends with his former head coach John Calipari.",
        "After the event, Jordyn and Karl posed for a group shot with Coach Calipari and his family.Coach Calipari shared the image to his Instagram account with the caption, 'Great time tonight at the wedding of Ray Oliver\u2019s daughter, Ashley, and Kevin Thomas! Congratulations to Ashley and Kevin!!'\u00a0Last month fans of Woods believed she was shading Kylie, and theorized that the model had taken Selena Gomez's side amid her alleged feud with her former pal.Just days after Jenner denied mocking Gomez's eyebrows, Woods gushed over a lip liner from Selena's makeup brand, Rare Beauty.In an Instagram Story the bombshell applied a creamy mauve lip pencil to her pout and stated that she 'loves' the product.The five-foot-nine beauty went on to reveal to fans that if they're 'wondering the shade color' it is called kind words.",
        "Some of Woods' followers speculated that she was shading Jenner, who ended their friendship after\u00a0her sister Khloe Kardashian's then-boyfriend Tristan Thompson was caught kissing Jordyn in 2019.The Life of Kylie alum's post comes after Jenner reportedly lost more than half a million followers, according to SocialBlade.com, after a TikTok user accused Jenner of making fun of the former Disney Channel star's eyebrows.",
        "Still, both women have publicly responded to the allegations, saying there was no feud between them.\u00a0Jordyn and Kylie were inseparable until their friendship suffered following the kissing scandal with Thompson.In the aftermath, the social media influencer appeared on an episode of Jada Pinkett Smith's Facebook Watch series, Red Table Talk, and addressed the scandal, denying that 'anything intimate' happened with Thompson, other than resting her legs on his.However, she admitted that Thompson kissed her as she was leaving the party: '[There was] no passion, no nothing. He just kissed me \u2026 it was a kiss on the lips. No tongue \u2026 no making out.'During her interview, Jordyn also famously responded to the allegations that she was trying to split up Tristan and Khloe, saying 'I don't need your situation' which many took as a hint at Tristan's unfaithful ways.Khloe publicly called Jordyn out on Twitter after the model shared her side of the story and said she wasn't the reason that Khloe and Tristan broke up.",
        "'Why are you lying @jordynwoods??' Khloe tweeted at the time. 'If you're going to try and save yourself by going public, INSTEAD OF CALLING ME PRIVATELY TO APOLOGIZE FIRST, at least be HONEST about your story. BTW, You ARE the reason my family broke up!'\u00a0Khloe - who first reconciled with Tristan after the incident - split up with the athlete last year, after Thompson admitted to fathering a son with fitness model Maralee Nichols while still in a relationship with Khloe.\u00a0At the time the Kardashians star and Thompson were also expecting a son via surrogate.Meanwhile Jordyn has been dating her NBA boyfriend Karl-Anthony since May 2020."
