        "NEW YORK, May 4 (Reuters) - Jefferies Financial Group is hiring three investment bankers focused on the energy transition space from Guggenheim Securities, sources familiar with the matter said.David Dolezal, Kyle Baker, and Jeff Tang will bolster Jefferies' capabilities in serving companies involved in the clean energy arena. They were all previously based in San Francisco for Guggenheim.The sources spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential information. Jefferies and Guggenheim declined to comment.Jefferies is one of the top investment banks in the United States for oil and gas transactions: by number of deals arranged, it has been the most active in 2022 and so far this year, while by deal value it is fourth over both periods, according to data provider Refinitiv.However, like many investment banks, Jefferies has been adapting its advisory capabilities due to heightened focus on the energy transition - from both clean energy companies and those traditionally operating in hydrocarbons.In October, Jefferies made Pete Bowden, its top oil and gas banker, global head of industrial, energy and infrastructure banking, to encapsulate this more holistic approach to energy.Dolezal was a senior managing director at Guggenheim, per regulatory filings, and Baker was originally hired by Guggenheim in December 2015, according to a statement announcing her appointment.",
