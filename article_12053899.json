UBS did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for a comment.UBS in March agreed to take over its rival for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.37 billion), assuming up to 5 billion in losses as part of a deal hastily arranged by Swiss authoritiesEarlier this week, Ermotti said UBS was working on closing its merger with Credit Suisse by the end of May or early June.The bank is also reviewing options for Credit Suisse's Swiss unit, including keeping the unit's investment banking operations while selling the rest, potentially in an initial public offering, Reuters reported earlier this week.
