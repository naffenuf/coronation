        "'Noted the rotary crews did the heavy lifting\u2026 perfect flying conditions if you ask me! A big thank you to everyone for making today happen,' the message, which was signed 'W' for William, read.The message poked fun at the rainy afternoon which saw the\u00a0RAF Air Chief Marshal Sir Michael Wigston sying it was '50/50' as to whether the flypast would take place, warning low cloud and rain would make it 'impossible' for pilots to navigate.'The Royal Air Force was incredibly proud to participate in His Majesty The King\u2019s Coronation Procession alongside the Royal Navy, the British Army, and Commonwealth Forces,' the tweet from the RAF read.\u00a0During the Royal Family's balcony appearance, The Mall was a sea of people, many of whom sprinted to get close to the Palace and catch a glimpse of the King and Queen following their historic coronation watched by 100million people on TV worldwide.",

        "But their uncle Prince Harry decided against going back to Buckingham Palace and appears to have been driven straight to Heathrow Airport to jet home after a 24-hour stay in the UK.\u00a0He is said to be determined to get back to California to see his son Archie's fourth birthday yesterday.As the aircraft approached, the Princess of Wales was seen speaking to Prince Louis and encouraging him to look up from the Buckingham Palace balcony.The Prince of Wales made a remark as he leaned closer to his wife, prompting her to turn and smile.Crowds took pictures, screamed and laughed as they watched the Red Arrows pass over Buckingham Palace.Royal fans moved onto The Mall to take selfies and film the helicopters and planes as they passed over. Others popped champagne corks and shouted 'God Save the King'.Meanwhile, Princess Charlotte appeared to take on a protective and reassuring role for her younger brother Prince Louis during yesterday's coronation celebrations - but couldn't help but share a giggle with the five-year-old at the Palace balcony appearance.\u00a0The eight-year-old daughter of the Prince and Princess of Wales\u00a0was seen sitting alongside her little brother Prince Louis, in a royal car with their parents after leaving the palace, and in the front row of the Abbey a short time later. The siblings held hands\u00a0during the opening moments of the historic service.",
        "Charlotte and Louis arrived without their older brother Prince George, nine, who was a Page of Honour for his grandfather.\u00a0They were immaculately behaved during the service, with Charlotte proving a reassuring presence to her younger brother, who couldn't help stifle a few yawns during the sacred service.\u00a0George, Charlotte and Louis were reunited after the service when they rode away from Westminster Abbey to Buckingham Palace in a carriage with their parents.\u00a0The trio later appeared on the balcony of Buckingham Palace with their parents, their newly crowned grandparents The King and Queen and the other working royals. During this appearance, Charlotte could be seen sharing a giggle with her youngest brother.\u00a0The young royal stood at the right of the monarchs on the balcony, as they watched a special fly past go over the royal residence.\u00a0Prince Louis, five, put on an animated display, while Charlotte and George also watched the moment happen with glee.\u00a0",
        "George, nine, was seen joking around with the other page boys who assisted with the King's cape during the ceremony.\u00a0Princess Charlotte looked resplendent in the white dress and headpiece that were picked for the momentous day.\u00a0The young princess wore an Alexander McQueen dress and cape in ivory silk crepe with ivory stitch embroidery featuring rose, thistle, daffodil and shamrock motifs, to signify the four nations.\u00a0",
        "She also wore a Jess Collett x Alexander McQueen Headpiece silver bullion, crystal and silver thread work, similar to the headpiece the Princess of Wales is wearing for the occasion.\u00a0Meanwhile, her younger brother Louis - who turned five on St George's Day on April 23rd - looked regal in a bespoke outfit.\u00a0",
        "For the historic occasion, the young Prince was wearing an outfit made by Savile Row tailors Dege and Skinner which consists of a Hainsworth Garter Blue Doeskin Tunic with specially designed lace work embellishment to the collar, cuffs and fronts. The leg garment was black complete with Garter Blue stripe.Last year Louis was the standout star of his great-grandmother's Platinum Jubilee celebrations, entertaining the crowds with his antics on the Buckingham Palace balcony and in the audience at the Jubilee pageant.\u00a0His parents aware of the responsibility on his young shoulders, Prince Louis won't attend tomorrow's concert in Windsor.The youngsters reunited for the grand carriage procession back to Buckingham Palace after witnessing King Charles being crowned at the Abbey.",
        "The King and Queen travelled in the 261-year-old Gold State Coach, followed by three carriages carrying working members of the Royal Family.In the first carriage behind them was the Prince and Princess of Wales, along with George, Charlotte and Louis.",
        "It was the biggest public test for the three siblings, who are becoming increasingly confident under the eyes of the watching world.Thousands gathered on the Mall this morning, as Charles III's day of destiny got underway. The historic first coronation of a British monarch in 70 years at Westminster Abbey saw just over 2,000 people arriving into Westminster Abbey.",
        "Charles was crowned in a Christian ceremony that dates back for 1,000 years on a day dripping with glorious displays of pageantry. The momentous event shone a spotlight on Britain\u2019s place on the world stage.His family, including Prince Andrew and Princess Anne, enjoyed a dinner at Mayfair club Oswald's last night. Mike and Zara Tindall were out until 2am. Prince Harry flew in from Los Angeles yesterday for his 24-hour trip. It emerged last night he has been relegated to the third row in the Abbey with other non-working royals.Around 100million watched on TV around the globe, with around\u00a0two million people - from all corners of the UK, Commonwealth and the world - in London for the historic event.\u00a0Guests of the King started arriving at the Abbey from 7am - four hours before the ceremony. Some 100 heads of state are in London, with representatives from 203 countries are attending."
