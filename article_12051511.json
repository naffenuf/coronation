        "Jack Grealish felt 'shy' playing alongside his idols after signing for Man CityGrealish loves to joke around with star Erling Haaland in the changing rooms\u00a0The midfielder also revealed he listens to the commentary back after a game\u00a0When\u00a0Jack Grealish became the Premier League\u2019s first \u00a3100million footballer in the summer of 2021, his agent sat him down for a talk.",
        "\u2018We had this big meeting,\u2019 Grealish reveals to Mail Sport. \u2018He said, \u201cYou are going to Manchester City and everything is gonna change. You have to realise nothing will ever be the same again\u201d.\u2018Sitting here now I can say I have dealt with it. But last season I didn\u2019t at all. But that was not off the pitch. That was on it.\u2019Grealish moved to City from Aston Villa, his hometown club, thinking his football life would be easier. How could it not be? He was a young and gifted attacking footballer joining one of the most potent offensive teams in Europe. Nine months after joining, his debut season ended with his first Premier League medal but also with hard lessons learned.\u2018I was a bit in awe of being here, a bit shy,\u2019 says Grealish, in that slow and recognisable Birmingham drawl. \u2018Not, like, in my personality but on the pitch. People would shout, \u201cJack, pass!\u201d and I would be, \u201cF***ing hell it\u2019s (Kevin) De Bruyne, I had better pass it to him\u201d. You know what I mean? He had been my idol.\u2019",
        "Almost exactly a year ago, Grealish was coming to terms with a difficult season\u2019s low point. City had taken a lead to the Santiago Bernabeu in a two-legged Champions League semi-final with Real Madrid. On Tuesday night the teams meet again at the same stage.",
        "The 27-year-old was not in Guardiola\u2019s first team back then but was introduced for the final 12 minutes in Madrid with City leading 5-3 on aggregate.Grealish immediately came close to scoring before somehow Real did so twice in stoppage time. A Karim Benzema penalty subsequently took Carlo Ancelotti\u2019s team through to the final.\u2018It was horrible,\u2019 says Grealish. \u2018The thing that p****d me off the most was their second goal. Dani Carvajal gets it and crosses. I was so leggy. I didn\u2019t feel fit, just miles off it and blowing.\u2018I just put a leg up to try and stop the cross and it was just sloppy. They scored and we know what happened. I was devastated after that, man. I was so down.\u2019",
        "Grealish is taller than you may imagine. Not quite as stocky and squat as he can appear on the field. He sits in a yellow armchair wearing a Gucci tracksuit that one would need both youth and a certain confidence to carry off. Grealish currently has both. These days he is an ambassador for the Italian fashion house, joining A-list singers Harry Styles, Miley Cyrus and Lana Del Rey.Recently he was invited to Elton John\u2019s dressing room after a concert. \u2018He said he liked my necklace,\u2019 smiles Grealish.",
        "But it is not celebrity, clothes or jewellery that give Grealish such confidence these days. It\u2019s football.We meet the day after City have beaten West Ham 3-0 to edge closer to a third consecutive league title. Ahead of today\u2019s home clash with Leeds, they need 12 points from five games.Since losing at Manchester United in mid-January, Grealish has started 21 of 23 matches. When it matters these days, he plays. As Pep Guardiola\u2019s gilded team push forwards with a Treble in their sights, Grealish has become as fundamental as De Bruyne or record-breaking centre forward Erling Haaland. The change in his circumstances has been stark.",
        "\u2018The main thing now is I feel loved,\u2019 he says. \u2018I feel the manager really trusts me. At Fulham last weekend I didn\u2019t have my best game. But Pep kept me on, trusting me. He was telling me, \u201cJack, get hold of the ball, keep it, win fouls\u201d. So you go home and feel happy.\u2018This is what I dreamed of. To play in every game for such an important team at such an important time.\u2019Grealish plays a different kind of football now. At Villa it was sometimes like watching a street footballer. It could be exhilarating but it was not what City paid all that money for.",
        "Grealish has subsequently learned to play within Guardiola\u2019s more defined structure, staying tight to the left touchline until moments arrive to cut loose. His defensive work, strange as it sounds, is just as impressive as what he does with the ball.\u2018Yeah, it was difficult to change,\u2019 he nods. \u2018Now I see these guys as my friends and I am like, \u201cGive me the ball\u201d. I demand it.\u2018I would still like to score more. My assists \u2014 not trying to big myself up \u2014 are now at 11 and I don\u2019t take any set-pieces. But it\u2019s not just numbers, is it?\u2019Grealish has historically been criticised for not releasing the ball quickly enough. On TV, two eminent midfielders of yore, Mail Sport\u2019s Graeme Souness and Roy Keane, have sometimes offered that view. Grealish takes a deep breath and goes in for the tackle.",
        "\u2018Oh don\u2019t,\u2019 he says. \u2018The way some of the TV pundits talk I can\u2019t actually catch my breath sometimes. It\u2019s as if they never played bad themselves. Graeme was an unbelievable player. But he used to say I held on to the ball too long.\u2018I was like, \u201cMate, I play for Aston Villa\u201d. A lot of the time we didn\u2019t have the ball so when we did the manager told me to keep it.",
        "\u2018It\u2019s the same here. Everyone sees Pep as a tiki-taka manager, but before the Bayern Munich game away in the Champions League he said, \u201cYou know what having balls is? It\u2019s about being the one to keep the ball, to calm the game down\u201d.\u2019\u2018So you do that and you get criticised. It\u2019s tricky. When I was at Villa nobody had paid any money for me so it didn\u2019t matter if I played bad. Also, 90 per cent of the games were not live on TV so people wouldn\u2019t notice anyway.\u2018It is different now but I will be honest here \u2014 if I have played well I go back home and watch everything and listen to the commentary and what they say afterwards.\u2018If I play s***, I will not listen to a word they say.\u2019Grealish has 31 England caps and, for now, one Premier League title. As well as being a Gucci ambassador, he recently signed a record-breaking boot deal with Puma.He has been written about in Vogue, Tatler and GQ. When he was featured on the front cover of FACE magazine, the accompanying write-up suggested that \u2018not since David Beckham has a footballer fascinated the nation so much\u2019. To maybe prove the point, it featured some arty, black-and-white close-up photographs of his calves.",
        "During our hour together, this is the first thing to knock him from his conversational stride.",
        "You aren\u2019t just \u2018Jack\u2019 any more, are you?\u2018Erm\u2026 I don\u2019t know what you want me to say to that.\u2019Well, if I put you in to Google now different things come up\u2026\u2018What used to come up? Me drunk?\u2019 he laughs.Well, a bloke who used to play for Aston Villa and who would occasionally fall out of a taxi.\u2018No, listen,\u2019 he laughs again. \u2018I know obviously things are different but I will be honest with you. Sometimes I don\u2019t like that. I just want to be my normal self. If you ask anyone who knows me, I am still just Jack if you know what I mean?\u2018I would like to do everything I used to do when I was younger and it is annoying sometimes because I can\u2019t.\u2018You mentioned a lot of stuff there and it\u2019s obviously nice. But I don\u2019t do any of that for money and you really have to believe when I say the main stuff for me is the football. It\u2019s about concentrating on the pitch. Yeah?\u2018That line from the magazine. It\u2019s not a bad thing to hear is it? You can understand bits of it because of the price tag and things. But I would like them to say that because of my football ability and trophies I win and the way I am playing. I don\u2019t know what else to say on that really\u2026\u2019",
        "Grealish is not short of self-awareness. He knows himself, all right. When he leaves a game, he would always instinctively prefer to turn right for a beer than left for the sofa. This occasionally got him in trouble at Villa but has not at City. He makes no attempt to hide what he fundamentally is and it is endearing.\u2018Everyone is different, aren\u2019t they?\u2019 he says. \u2018Look at Erling. He is the best professional I have ever seen. His mindset is something you won\u2019t see again. He does everything. Recovers. In the gym. Ten hours of treatment a day. Ice baths. Diet. That\u2019s why he is what he is. But I swear I couldn\u2019t be like that.\u2018We have a great friendship but he will point at me after a game and say, \u201cHey, don\u2019t you go out tonight partying\u201d. I just tell him to shut up and go and sit in his ice bath. But that\u2019s us. Two different people doing well in our own way.\u2018I am not as successful as him. He has scored more goals this season than I have in my whole career. But if he did what I occasionally did he would be like, \u201cF***ing hell I feel terrible today\u201d.\u2018I have a release that\u2019s different to his. He is going home and sitting with his family and having a takeaway. Sometimes that\u2019s my choice, too. I love doing that. But sometimes I like to go out and let my hair down.\u2018I am not gonna sit here and lie and say I don\u2019t go out. What\u2019s the point? It\u2019s also pointless telling you I am here at 8am going in the gym and that\u2019s the reason I am playing well. It\u2019s not.\u2018The reason I am playing well is because I feel fit, confident, good in myself and like I am at home here. But I still love an occasional drink and going out with my friends. That\u2019s just normal.\u2019",
        "It strikes me that trying to go out in Manchester or indeed Birmingham when you are Jack Grealish must entail a certain amount of planning. Subterfuge even.\u2018I can\u2019t tell you because you will follow me, won\u2019t you?\u2019 he says with a wink. \u2018I just look after myself more now. In the old days I would have one drink and think I had this invisible cloak on where nobody could see me.\u2018Now I just have people who look after me and I go to more secretive places. I have actually been really good these last few months. I have not been out much and told myself I wouldn\u2019t until I had a medal or two round my neck.\u2018I like to think life hasn\u2019t changed who I am. Why should it? I just like going to normal places.\u2018I like going for nice food but I don\u2019t have to go for nice food. I still love sitting in Nando\u2019s with my family. Even if I go to a nightclub, I don\u2019t have to have the best table.\u2018I love going to 80s clubs and just chilling at the bar. I would love to be able to do that. That\u2019s why in the summer I am gonna buy a wig\u2026\u2019Grealish\u00a0comes from a big family and would like to be a father.\u2018I think I would be a sick (great) dad,\u2019 he laughs. \u2018I was lucky that I had the best upbringing. I love my mum and dad so much, they did everything for me. It makes me want to do the same for my own children when I do have them.\u2018I am not sure when that will be. I need to grow up a bit first. To me, everything is about enjoying life. I am so blessed doing what I am doing but I do need that balance between football and the rest.",
        "\u2018I don\u2019t want to get emotional but life is just short. A young guy I knew in Birmingham died at the weekend. I was in the hotel at Fulham before the game. It\u2019s just so scary. You never know what\u2019s gonna happen. I was so emotional in the room. It makes you realise that a lot of the time you have to do what makes you happy.\u2019At City, Grealish has developed a rapport with the club\u2019s young supporters. His sister Hollie has cerebral palsy. \u2018I know what it\u2019s like when she is really happy and I know I can have that kind of impact on children and fans,\u2019 he explains. \u2018When you can help, you are going to, aren\u2019t you? A lot of footballers do it and it brings a tear to my eye. You can make someone\u2019s day by doing something so little. We don\u2019t do it for clout. It\u2019s because we want to.\u2019Part of Gareth Southgate\u2019s England team, Grealish has, along with the likes of Bukayo Saka and Jude Bellingham, become the face of what could be a brighter future.",
        "\u2018Every away ground I go to with City I get booed,\u2019 he laughs. \u2018I am not sure why. But when I play for England, I feel that love. I remember at the Euros at Wembley getting a big cheer when my face appeared on the screen. It made me happy. There is a bond there.\u2019Back in Manchester, only one thing really matters now. Or three things. With five weeks of the season to go, there are a trio of trophies and a shot at immortality to aim for. Only one English team, Manchester United, has ever won the Premier League, FA Cup and the Champions League in one season.\u2018Listen, we are in exactly the same position as last year in Europe,\u2019 he says. \u2018Real Madrid again. Three games away from winning the Champions League. All I can say is that I have never had so much confidence and belief in my team-mates and myself before a game as I have before going there next week.\u2018Well, apart from when I was six and thought I was the best player in the world\u2026\u2019"
