        "Sir Keir Starmer will warn his shadow cabinet the \u201chardest part lies ahead\u201d as he welcomes signs that voters are returning to Labour after leaving over Brexit and Jeremy Corbyn.",
        "The Labour leader will tell his top team on Tuesday they must demonstrate how Labour would create a \u201cbig reforming government\u201d rather than relying on the Conservatives\u2019 unpopularity.But he will acknowledge there is \u201ca lot of scepticism\u201d about politics and tell them they must show they have plans that offer \u201cnot just reassurance, but the hope the country needs\u201d.In the coming weeks, Labour will unveil missions on education reform, clean power and making the NHS fit for the future as it seeks to bolster support.Sir Keir believes the Prime Minister has made a strategic error by thinking that voters are more concerned with \u201cwoke\u201d issues than the cost of living and the NHS.Labour gained 635 councillors across England in last week\u2019s polls as the Conservatives lost 960 seats under Rishi Sunak\u2019s leadership.",
        "The Opposition was particularly buoyed by winning control of councils in the Brexit-backing areas of Dover, Blackpool, Medway, Erewash, and Stoke.But pollsters suggested the Opposition may fall short of winning an overall majority in the Commons without progress ahead of the general election, expected next year.Sir Keir will issue the warning to the regular meeting of his shadow cabinet.\u201cThe hardest part lies ahead,\u201d he is expected to say.\u201cThe fact that Labour won in all parts of the country was a sign of the strides we have made. People who turned away from us during the Corbyn years and the Brexit years are coming back.",
        "\u201cBut there is understandably a lot of scepticism about politics out there and now we need to go from reassurance to hope. We need to show that we will be a big reforming government bringing hope of a better life for working people.\u201dMr Sunak has promised to work \u201cnight and day\u201d to deliver on the priorities he has set for the nation as he comes under pressure over the election results.Former levelling up secretary Simon Clarke said the Prime Minister\u2019s \u201cmajor mistake\u201d of dropping housebuilding had played a role in the poor performance.Sir Keir argues that the Conservatives are \u201cdoing too little, too late to repair the damage they have done\u201d to the health service.\u201cThe NHS trumps \u2018woke\u2019 every day of the week,\u201d Sir Keir will tell his shadow cabinet.He is also considering putting higher taxes on foreign buyers of UK homes as the party seeks to pressure the Government on the housing crisis.The Opposition was understood to be adapting policy to increase the 2% surcharge on stamp duty for overseas buyers and banning them purchasing more than 50% of homes in a development.They could also introduce a rule allowing first-time buyers first access to new developments.Sir Keir will also speak to the 22 new Labour council leaders on Tuesday."
