        "Among the audience were dozens of winners of the Queen's Coronation Champions Awards, supported by the Daily Mail.\u00a0The newly crowned monarch and his wife appeared to enjoy the show as Lionel Richie performed 'All Night Long', at one point getting up on their feet and swaying to the music.

        "Other collaborations included Andrea Bocelli and Sir Bryn Terfel, who sang You'll Never Walk Alone, and Lang Lang and Nicole Scherzinger, who performed Reflection from Mulan.Artist Tracey Emin discussed the King's watercolours, before some were beamed across the castle walls, accompanied by an enchanting recital of Bach's Prelude in C major by piano prodigy Lucy Illingworth.\u00a0Actor Richard E Grant appeared to discuss Queen Camilla's book club. The organisers had included the King's master of ceremonies, the Earl Marshal (the Duke of Norfolk) and his Master of the Royal Household.\u00a0",
        "Stars including Hugh Jackman, Pierce Brosnan, Dame Joan Collins, Bear Grylls OBE, Alan Titchmarsh, and Sir Tom Jones gave pre-recorded video messages in honour of the King throughout the concert, which was hosted by Hugh Bonneville.Top Gun star Tom Cruise delivered a video message from his War Bird plane, saying: 'Pilot to pilot. Your Majesty, you can be my wingman any time,' before saluting and banking off.The mandatory James Bond element was provided by Pierce Brosnan, reminding the audience of the King's youthful 'action man skills'. Cue some grainy shots of the young Charles in various uniforms.\u00a0Muppets stars Kermit and Miss Piggy also gave speeches, with the frog saying he was 'honoured' to have been invited to the coronation.\u00a0",
        "Miss Piggy sparked huge laughter from the King after she described host Hugh Bonneville as a 'real Lord' - mistaking the actor for the character he plays in Downton Abbey, the Earl of Grantham.The King then laughed even harder after she referred to him as 'King Charlesy Warlesy' and said he was 'expecting' Kermit the Frog in the royal box.Even Charlotte and George smiled as they watched on intently, while the Prince of Wales laughed along with his father.",
        "Just before Hugh Bonneville introduced the final act of the star-studded concert, Take That, the BBC cut to the royal box, where Kermit waved a Union flag in front of a grinning Duke of Edinburgh.The King looked to his left as he clapped before Bonneville signed off: 'And, of course, thank you your majesties, for allowing us to perform for you here. We sincerely hope you and the frog have enjoyed yourselves.'More reflective moments included Stella McCartney's address about the environment and a Winnie the Pooh skit - which followed Paddington Bear's appearance with Queen Elizabeth II at the late monarch's Platinum Jubilee.\u00a0Pooh and Piglet popped up to discuss the King's lifelong love of Scotland's dwindling red squirrel population. The monarch has, indeed, installed a squirrel flap at his Birkhall home so that Tufty and Co have access to a 24-hour nut supply.\u00a0",
        "As a message from the monarch about the importance of conservation played for the audience, a lights and drone show featuring whales, tigers, and owls lit up the sky over the castle.The evening also featured 'Lighting up the Nation', in which well-known locations across Britain were illuminated using projections, lasers and drone displays.",
        "William also\u00a0delivered his emotional address that paid\u00a0tribute to his father, telling him: 'Pa, we are all so proud of you.'The Prince left barely a dry eye in the crowd \u2013 let alone the millions watching around the world \u2013 as he told them: 'As my grandmother said when she was crowned, coronations are a declaration of our hopes for the future.'And I know she's up there, fondly keeping an eye on us. She would be a very proud mother.'For all that celebrations are magnificent, at the heart of the pageantry is a simple message: service. My father's first words on entering Westminster Abbey yesterday were a pledge of service. It was a pledge to continue to serve.'In a heartfelt homage to his father, with whom he has not always seen eye to eye, William praised the King's legacy on everything from charities such as the Prince's Trust to his pioneering work on the environment and attempts to promote interfaith and cultural harmony.",
        "He also said he wanted to express his 'pride and gratitude for the millions of people who serve, in the forces, in classrooms, hospital wards and local communities', some of whom were in the audience. William said: 'I wish I could mention you all. Your service inspires us. And tonight we celebrate you too.'William concluded with his own stirring pledge to the nation as his father's son and heir, saying: 'I commit myself to serve you all \u2013 King, country and Commonwealth. God Save The King!'"
