        "The King\u2019s coronation will be \u201cjaw-dropping\u201d but the monarch remains \u201crelaxed and very gracious\u201d despite the \u201chuge burden\u201d ahead of him, the Dean of Westminster has said.",
        "The Very Reverend Dr David Hoyle said rehearsals for the big day have gone well and Charles was not at all anxious about the momentous occasion.Replica crowns have been used for the dry runs, and the children, which includes Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis, attending were \u201cwatching with huge interest\u201d, the dean revealed.",
        "The dean, speaking at Westminster Abbey ahead of the May 6 ceremony, told Sky News: \u201cThe King was relaxed and very gracious.\u201cHe took time to thank all the people around him who are making this happen.\u201cSo whilst he has a huge burden on him, there\u2019s a lot for him to do, he doesn\u2019t give the sense of being a man who\u2019s really anxious about this, not at all.\u201dThe dean, who will take part in the ceremony conducted by the Archbishop Canterbury, said: \u201cI\u2019m the Dean of Westminster. I\u2019m used to ceremony on a national level. Even I think this is pretty jaw-dropping.\u201dHe described the ceremonial dress and Crown Jewels being used as \u201cextraordinary\u201d and the music as \u201cspine-tingling\u201d.",
        "On occasion, St Edward\u2019s Crown \u2013 used for the moment of crowning \u2013 has been put on back to front at previous coronations.King George VI recounted in great detail all the mishaps during his ceremony in 1937, including the crown being put on back to front after a piece of red cotton indicating the front was removed.",
        "The dean, who will have to handle the crown, said he has been practising its movements to ensure it is put on the King\u2019s head the correct way.\u201cOur secret is not to tie bits of thread to it because someone removes them,\u201d he added."
