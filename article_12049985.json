        "Christmas Tree Shops, a legendary New England retailer which has stores across the US, is said to be in peril as lawyers ready documents amid its reported insolvency.The store - which last year was forced to rebrand to CTS as some customers assumed they only sold Christmas trees - has 83 locations around the country, according to its website.For more than five decades, the bargain retailer has sold household furniture, food, toys as well as the eponymous Christmas decorations.\u00a0Now,\u00a0just like its old owner, the New England firm risks closing its doors to customers for good.",

        "This comes after Christmas Tree Shops' previous owners Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond filed for bankruptcy last month.The furnishings giant filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection at the end of April after failing to secure funds to stay afloat, announcing all 360 nationwide stores will eventually close, putting 30,000 jobs at risk.The home goods retailer filed for bankruptcy in a District of New Jersey court, listing both its estimated assets and liabilities in the range of $1 billion and $10 billion, according to the court filing.Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond stores will stay open for the time being, but a liquidation process has begun which will eventually see all 360 of its stores closing.The company said it has received a commitment of approximately $240 million in debtor-in-possession financing from Sixth Street Specialty Lending Inc, according to a separate statement.\u00a0",
        "The store has since moved to 'slash' prices to empty some of its defunct stock.Following the April filing, Sue Gove, president &amp; CEO of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Inc., said: 'Millions of customers have trusted us through the most important milestones in their lives \u2013 from going to college to getting married, settling into a new home to having a baby.'Our teams have worked with incredible purpose to support and strengthen our beloved banners, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and BuyBuy BABY.'We deeply appreciate our associates, customers, partners, and the communities we serve, and we remain steadfastly determined to serve them throughout this process.'We will continue working diligently to maximize value for the benefit of all stakeholders.'Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond had previously warned of a potential bankruptcy in early January when it issued a 'going concern' notice that it might not be able to cover its expenses following a difficult holiday season."
