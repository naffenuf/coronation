        "Mark Selby claimed his fourth World Snooker Championship title on this day in 2021.",
        "Selby beat Shaun Murphy 18-15 at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield to collect \u00a3500,000 in prize money.A fourth world triumph took 37-year-old Selby to within three Crucible crowns of Stephen Hendry\u2019s record of seven.",
        "\u201cTo win it once against Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan for the first time was a dream come true,\u201d Selby said.\u201cTo win it four times is something I could only have dreamed of.\u201cEvery time you get to a world final you always try your hardest.\u201cIt\u2019s such a tough tournament to get there and you never know whether it\u2019s going to be your last.\u201d",
        "Murphy\u2019s resolve in a high-quality encounter was finally ended by Selby breaks of 66, 68 and 120.\u201cMark is super-granite, unfortunately for me,\u201d Murphy said.\u201cI started well but he went into super-hard mode.\u201dThe concluding sessions of the Championship saw a capacity crowd return to a major UK sporting event for the first time since March 2020 and the start of the coronavirus pandemic."
