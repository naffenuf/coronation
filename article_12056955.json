Jill and I are praying for their families and for others critically injured, and we are grateful to the first responders who acted quickly and courageously to save lives.\u00a0'Yesterday, an assailant in tactical gear armed with an AR-15 style assault weapon gunned down innocent people in a shopping mall, and not for the first time. Such an attack is too shocking to be so familiar. And yet, American communities have suffered roughly 200 mass shootings already this year, according to leading counts. More than 14,000 of our fellow citizens have lost their lives, credible estimates show. The leading cause of death for American kids is gun violence.\u00a0",
        "'Since I signed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act into law and took two dozen executive actions to stem the tide of gun violence, we have made some progress. States are banning assault weapons, expanding red flag laws and more \u2014 but it\u2019s not enough. We need more action, faster to save lives.'Too many families have empty chairs at their dinner tables. Republican Members of Congress cannot continue to meet this epidemic with a shrug. Tweeted thoughts and prayers are not enough.'Once again I ask Congress to send me a bill banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Enacting universal background checks. Requiring safe storage. Ending immunity for gun manufacturers. I will sign it immediately. We need nothing less to keep our streets safe.'",

Lee said it 'sounded like a warzone' as frantic shoppers started fleeing from the hail of bullets.",
        "In the chaos that ensued, the unnamed store associate gathered a frantic Lee and 12 others, including several children, and hid them inside the store's bathroom closet. The worker then left the group, and Lee hours later was escorted out by police.On her way out, Lee recalled realizing that among the mass of 'bullets and bodies' outside, was the same store worker that hid her barely an hour before.'The store associate saved our lives,' Lee tearfully told CBS News Texas Sunday, ultimately cutting the interview short after becoming too emotional.'I was crouching down, like, \"I hope we don't get hit by a bullet,\"' the near-victim added of when the gunfire began.'Earlier in the interview, Lee explained how she parked her White SUV in front of the H&amp;M where the gunman was seen arriving and opening fire on a group that included children.Lee said that immediately, even inside the store, she and other shoppers recognized they were gun shots and ran for cover.'The gunshots \u2013 it sounded like a warzone,' she recalled. 'It was horrifying and it felt like you were in a dream.'",
        "Fontayne Payton, 35, was at H&amp;M when he heard the sound of gunshots through his headphones. He said: 'It was so loud, it sounded like it was right outside.",
        "'I pray it wasn't kids, but it looked like kids,' he said.\u00a0The bodies were covered in white towels, slumped over bags on the ground. 'It broke me when I walked out to see that.'Payton then saw the body of the dead shooter - which was the only one not covered, he recalled.\u00a0Another witness, Kimberly Blakey, said she and her daughter, 14, were among the crowd of people rushing to flee the parking lot after the gunfire started.She said the raining bullets were 'non-stop.' Her car got shot at during the ordeal as she tried to escape.\u00a0Blakey told CNN: 'I told my daughter to get down. I could hear her start praying.'\u00a0Another witness,\u00a0Sheliza Ramlall, who was in the Nike store when the violence broke out, said: 'I had the most horrifying experience earlier. I was standing in line at the Nike store when all of a sudden people started to scream and run.\u00a0",
        "'The people in the doorway saw the man with the gun outside and raised the alarm. All of us in line dropped to the floor and started to crawl looking for a hiding place while falling over each other.\u00a0'I crawled behind the counter. At that moment, I realized that we were right in plain sight and and figured that I needed to get away from the front.\u00a0'As I looked to the back of the store, I heard someone saying \u2018get to the back, get to the back\u2019 and everyone started running at that point. An employee opened the back door and let us out. We are standing by the roadside shaken, crying, and hugging each other.'Not knowing where the gunman was or what was happening on the other side was terrifying but I wanted to get out of there so I left the crowd and started to flag the cars down to give me a lift.\u00a0'An elderly woman stopped and I hopped in a panic. She started to tell me about the gunshots she heard and drove me to my car. I raced out of there with an elevated heartbeat.\u00a0'I am grateful for our brave first responders who stopped the shooter and helped the people to safety.'"
