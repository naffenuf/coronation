It simply is what it is \u2026 and we react, respond and interpret the events that come along in ways that suit us.

        "SCORPIOOct 24 - Nov 22\u00a0We don't need to be told that sweeping things under the carpet is a bad idea. But that doesn't stop us from sticking problems into metaphorical dark cupboards.
