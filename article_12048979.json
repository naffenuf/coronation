        "Oh to be a fly on the wall at Buckingham Palace as King Charles today lunches the Governor Generals and Prime Ministers of his 14 remaining overseas territories. Half those at the Royal trough plan to de-throne him. Jamaica, the Bahamas, Antigua, St Vincent and Belize all have reviews under way to replace him. Australia is increasingly anti-monarch while New Zealand\u2019s prime minister Chris Hipkins and St Kitts\u2019 PM Terrance Drew make no secret of their republican views. The late Queen\u00a0was adept at charming those who wanted to abolish her. Has her son inherited that talent?Among rituals practised is the signing of the Coronation Oath with the King\u2019s chosen pen thoroughly road tested. Having to go through the ceremony with stained fingers wouldn\u2019t do anything for HM\u2019s blood pressure. The Queen\u2019s coronation pen was made by the Worshipful Company of Scriveners from ivory, gold, enamel and gemstones. It featured two cherubs representing Charles and Anne. Will the King be immortalising William and Harry on his own implement?\u00a0",
        "Andrew Parker Bowles remembers at the last coronation he and his fellow page boys receiving sticks of barley sugar to suck. One of them, Duncan Davidson, managed to cajole Andrew and the others to hand over the treat. \u2018He ate it all and then was sick,\u2019 recalls APB. Duncan went on to great wealth as founder of house builder Persimmon. \u2018Even in those days,\u2019 remarks Andrew, \u2018he was quite commercially minded.\u2019Marriage to Rupert Murdoch may not have been an untrammelled bed of roses for Jerry Hall. According to a Vanity Fair profile describing the couple\u2019s 2020 Covid quarantine at his \u00a320million Bel Air Vineyard Moraga, Rupert kept Jerry busy doing an online course in winemaking. It wasn\u2019t just to slake his thirst \u2013 \u2018Hall told friends,\u2019 reveals Vanity Fair, \u2018that Murdoch wanted her to do it so he could write off $3million of vineyard expenses as long as she worked 500 hours a year on winemaking.\u2019\u00a0",
        "Gyles Brandreth recalls playwright Noel Coward\u2019s remark at the 1953 coronation when asked to identify the diminutive Sultan of Kelantan sitting next to the 6ft 3in Queen Salote of Tonga in the processional carriage. \u2018That,\u2019 noted Coward, \u2018is her lunch.\u2019 The late Queen heard the quip only afterwards. \u2018It made her laugh out loud,\u2019 writes Gyles in The Spectator.\u00a0Dame Joan Collins recalls her first meeting with King Charles at a charity ball in Palm Beach. \u2018We had a little dance together, which was very nice,\u2019 she remembers. Charles also retains pleasant memories, writing: \u2018She was very amusing and with an unbelievable cleavage (all raised up and presented as if on a tray!), so eye wander was a problem!\u2019 Sadly, his eyes failed to wander to Joan\u2019s address for the Coronation guest list. She hasn\u2019t been invited.\u00a0"
