        "A graphic designer who saved an average of \u00a31,600 per month over approximately two years, amounting to a total of \u00a340,000, has fulfilled a childhood promise and bought a two-bedroom house for his single mother who had been struggling to afford her rent.",
        "Will Hemming, 32, a creative director who lives in London, told his mother Vivienne years ago: \u201cMum, when I grow up, I\u2019ll buy you a house.\u201dVivienne, a 69-year-old banqueting manager, explained that Will was about 11 when he said this, and it was when the family-of-four was living in Alcester, Warwickshire, and had a \u201cbeautiful life\u201d.",
        "Vivienne\u2019s marriage subsequently \u201cwent upside down\u201d and she was later diagnosed with breast cancer. She had to sell the family home and moved into another property in 2018.Struggling to pay her rent, especially during the Covid pandemic, Vivienne lived in three different properties over the next four years and ended up owing one of her landlords \u00a37,000.Will said his mother is \u201cvery resilient\u201d and would never ask for help, despite her \u201cdepleted savings\u201d \u2013 and so in 2020, he decided to look into covering a mortgage for her in secret.",
        "Since he was not buying the property for himself, he needed a 20% deposit for the house \u2013 \u00a340,000 \u2013 so Will, who has an annual salary of \u00a375,000, began saving, putting an average of \u00a31,600 monthly into Monzo Pots over about two years.On the day he revealed the secret and told Vivienne he had bought a house for her, Will said she was \u201cin shock\u201d and did not believe him, but she has since settled into the cottage-style, two-bedroom end-of-terrace house in Alcester and is \u201creally thankful\u201d.",
        "\u201cWe were talking about her wanting to move, like we always would, and I just said, \u2018Would you move somewhere in Alcester?\u2019\u201d Will said.",
        "\u201cShe said \u2018Yeah\u2019 and then I said, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s good, because I\u2019ve bought a house in Alcester for you to live in, if you want to live in it\u2019.\u201cShe said, \u2018Yeah, that would be nice, that would be really nice. Wait, what did you say?\u2019\u201cShe was really confused, and I think she was in shock\u2026 but she was really happy.\u201d",
        "Will said he and his mother used to \u201cjoke around\u201d about him buying a house for her.At the time, it \u201cseemed like a massive expense\u201d \u2013 and since he was living in London, paying expensive rent, bills and council tax, he had \u201cno intention of buying a house\u201d.\u201cIt was always there as an idea, but never really taken seriously,\u201d Will said.\u201cBut then I thought, I\u2019m saving some money, what am I going to do with it?\u201d",
        "Will wanted to invest his savings rather than leaving them in his bank account, and as his mother was struggling with renting, he started considering buying a property.He began saving money using Monzo Pots \u2013 where customers can keep money separate from the balance in their main account \u2013 their round-up tool, and the 1p Saving Challenge.",
        "The challenge involves saving small amounts of money every day, starting with 1p. The next day you save 2p, and then 3p, until you save a total of \u00a3667.95 in a year.Will then started speaking with mortgage advisers and viewing houses in Alcester, but everything was done without Vivienne\u2019s knowledge.",
        "Vivienne said he would ask her questions about where she would like to live, and what type of property she would prefer, but she never thought anything of it.\u201cI always wanted to keep it a surprise, but at the same time it was like a safety net as well, just in case it didn\u2019t work out,\u201d Will explained.He had no timeframe in mind when he started saving for the deposit in 2020, which meant the challenge was not \u201cdaunting\u201d but \u201cquite liberating\u201d.While he restricted certain expenditures and made \u201csmall sacrifices\u201d, such as reviewing the number of subscriptions he paid for and not buying as many clothes or going out as much, he said it resulted in \u201cpositive changes\u201d in how he viewed his finances.",
        "\u201cGetting to know who you are financially is a really positive thing, it reveals a lot about who you are,\u201d Will said.\u201cBeing more honest with yourself and looking into how you are with money, opening your eyes to it and not being embarrassed or ashamed, is a really good way of managing your life and what you can do.\u201d",
        "In the first year, he saved about \u00a320,000, and he replicated this over the second year through saving and doing freelance work.He said saving enough for the deposit was an \u201camazing\u201d feeling, especially as he had found the \u201cperfect\u201d house for Vivienne.",
        "He said speaking to professionals, not making promises, staying patient, and making financial \u201csacrifices that are worthy\u201d were vital in ensuring he achieved his goal while still enjoying life \u2013 and he said \u201cif you really put your mind to something, you can do it\u201d.He also believes he would not have been able to save as much without Monzo due to how \u201ctransparent\u201d everything is.\u201cIt felt really good, it felt really good knowing it was now possible,\u201d he said.While it \u201cfelt like a never-ending process\u201d for a while, with copious amounts of documents, emails and meetings, Will said finally holding the key to the new home was the best part.",
        "The two-bedroom cottage is \u201ccosy\u201d, \u201cquirky\u201d and traditional, with an open kitchen and garden.Vivienne moved in last year, and Will feels he does not have to \u201cstress\u201d about her living situation as the house will \u201ckeep her safe\u201d and give her security when she retires.\u201cI said to her, \u2018If anything goes wrong, no one\u2019s going to kick you out\u2019,\u201d he said.",
        "\u201cThat was the nicest thing for me.\u201d",
        "Vivienne said she never thought she would be able to buy a new home, especially as a single mother, but she now has \u201cpeace of mind\u201d and covers the mortgage with Will.She described him as \u201csuch a loving, caring person\u201d, and even now she is \u201cin disbelief\u201d that she has her own home.She said: \u201cAn unbelievable weight has been lifted.\u201cWhen do I retire? When do I give up? I don\u2019t want to give up, but at least I know I can.\u201d",
        "She added: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t change him for the world.\u201cHe\u2019s a sweetheart, he\u2019s my rock; he held me up when I was down.\u201cHe could have bought himself a house, or he could have bought a little house in Portugal with his girlfriend, but he put me first.\u201d"
