        "Lamborghini was doused in petrolPolice say possible criminal linksShocking new video has emerged of a\u00a0$400,000 luxury sports car being doused in petrol and set alight in the early hours of the morning, as police probe gang links.",
        "The footage showed a man dressed all in black running up to the 2022 Lamborghini 724 Coupe at Sydney's Olympic Park at around 1am on Tuesday morning and pouring fuel all over it from an orange jerry can.Another man, also dressed in black, then set the car alight, which was followed by an explosion and a huge burst of flames engulfing the car and filling the video screen.The police are looking at several lines of inquiry into why the Lamborghini, which was rented, was targeted, including\u00a0organised crime and a possible love-triangle argument.\u00a0'As inquiries continue, police would like to speak with two unknown males who may have been in the vicinity a short time before the fire started,' a police spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia.\u00a0",
        "Locals said a driver had parked the car at midnight, leaving it on the roadside at the intersection of Olympic Boulevarde and Sarah Durack Avenue.\u00a0The police said there were no reports of injuries, though the blue\u00a0Lamborghini was destroyed and a nearby BMW i8 was damaged by the heat of the flames.\u00a0Emergency services were called to the scene with five fire crews taking over an hour to put out the blaze.\u00a0",
        "Superintendent Adam Dewberry of NSW Fire and Rescue said the fire was so hot the Lamborghini 'basically melted into the road'.\u00a0",
        "The police have urged anyone with information about the identity of the two men seen in the video to come forward.\u00a0Anyone with information is asked to call police or Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.\u00a0"
