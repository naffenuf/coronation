So we're off to Vegas,' Mullin told the magazine.\u00a0'Ryan and Rob told us to leave our cards at home, they're sorting the lot. They sent us a full itinerary just now.\u00a0'Part of me doesn't want to go, I might be dead by the end of it! But I'd never go to Vegas by my own accord, so I'm buzzing for it.'",
        "The players previously celebrated on home soil on Tuesday with an open-top bus parade which saw Reynolds and McElhenney jet in to celebrate the promotion successes of both their men's and women's sides.\u00a0\u00a0"
