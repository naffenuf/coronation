        "Rishi Sunak\u2019s \u201cmajor mistake\u201d of dropping housebuilding targets played a role in the Conservatives\u2019 dire local election results, former levelling up secretary Simon Clarke said.",
        "The senior Conservative MP argued on Monday that the Government\u2019s attempts to \u201cpander to the public\u2019s worst instincts\u201d of Nimbyism on homes was failing.The Prime Minister was under pressure after the Tories shed 960 councillors across England in Thursday\u2019s elections in a result approaching the party\u2019s most pessimistic predictions.Labour gained 635 seats and won control of 22 councils as the Liberal Democrats also performed strongly. The point is that we\u2019ve lost huge swathes of councillors in the South East while having dropped targets and having run away from this argument, so it\u2019s not rewarding us in the South East, it\u2019s actually hurting us  Simon Clarke , former levelling up secretary  Mr Clarke, who served in Liz Truss\u2019s chaotic and brief government, blamed both the tumult of last year and current policy for the Tories\u2019 electoral failings.But he urged colleagues not to be \u201craking over the coals of what happened\u201d under past administrations and to instead focus on the present.",
        "Mr Clarke told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cIn these results there is one theme that stands out above all others for me is that we cannot out-Nimby the Liberal Democrats and the Greens, so one aspect of policy that does need to change and change as a matter of urgency is our housing policy.",
        "\u201cSo we can get back to building the homes that people need, making the case, the moral, economic, political case, for building the homes that a growing population requires rather than, I\u2019m afraid, trying to pander to the public\u2019s worst instincts on this question, which isn\u2019t working.\u201cI would say that dropping those targets was a major mistake and I would like those restored.\u201dHe also said there is a need to give more resources to council planning departments, to look at incentives for new infrastructure and to take on the \u201chollowness\u201d of the Nimby position.Last year Mr Sunak caved to pressure from Tory backbenchers to make the target of building 300,000 houses a year in England advisory rather than mandatory and has argued there is little support for \u201ctop-down targets\u201d.Some argue that while housebuilding may be needed to increase the chances of holding on to the northern voters won over by Boris Johnson, it will be damaging to the Tories\u2019 chances in their more traditional southern heartlands.But Mr Clarke said: \u201cThe point is that we\u2019ve lost huge swathes of councillors in the South East while having dropped targets and having run away from this argument, so it\u2019s not rewarding us in the South East, it\u2019s actually hurting us.\u201d",
        " The local elections showed that the public clearly has no confidence in Sunak or the Conservatives, so it\u2019s time for a general election now  Sir Ed Davey, Liberal Democrat leader  Meanwhile, the Lib Dems hope to add to the pressure on Mr Sunak by tabling a motion of no confidence in his Government in the Commons as soon as Tuesday.The Prime Minister would be highly likely to win if it reached a vote because he commands a large majority in the House.Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said: \u201cThe local elections showed that the public clearly has no confidence in Sunak or the Conservatives, so it\u2019s time for a general election now.\u201cThere\u2019s only one reason Rishi Sunak would deny British people a say at the ballot box: because he is running scared and knows he\u2019d lose.\u201d"
