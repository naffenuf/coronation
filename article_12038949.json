        "Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney joined the party as thousands of fans lined the streets to celebrate Wrexham\u2019s return to the Football League with a trophy parade on Tuesday evening.",
        "Phil Parkinson\u2019s side \u2013 who picked up a National League record 111 points as they edged out Notts County in a gripping title race \u2013 showed off their trophy, along with the women\u2019s team, who have earned promotion to the Genero Adran Premier.Three open top buses slowly navigated their way around the city on a loop that started and finished outside the Racecourse Ground, cutting through a fog of red smoke from the ubiquitous flares.",
        "Hollywood stars Reynolds and McElhenney, whose takeover and \u00a310million investment in the Red Dragons has helped transform the club\u2019s fortunes, joined the women\u2019s team on the second of three buses, with Parkinson alongside his staff on the third.The men\u2019s team soaked up the adulation from the top of the first. Fans chanted \u2018One more year\u2019 at former Premier League goalkeeper Ben Foster, who came out of retirement to sign a one-year deal in September, and several of his team-mates joined in.Such is the global nature of this north Wales club these days that there were Canadian maple leafs and the American stars and stripes among the hundreds of Welsh dragons along the route, while Skid the Dachshund sported a custom-made hat.An American couple joined the hundreds of fans who set up camp in the car park of The Turf pub alongside the Racecourse Ground, having taken time out from a holiday in Ireland to experience the party laid on by a club they discovered during lockdown.",
        "\u201cWith Covid happening all around the world we heard this story and we watched them on the streaming services,\u201d said Robin Beattie. \u201cWe fell in love with it.\u201cWe happened to be on vacation in Dublin and said, \u2018Let\u2019s hop on over\u2019. We\u2019re very happy to see the excitement in the town. It\u2019s a Cinderella story. We love it.\u201d",
        "But, while there was inevitably an international presence on the day, this was a party primarily enjoyed by the locals, those fans that Parkinson had talked about when he said earning promotion was about ending 15 years of hurt in the town.Supporters could have been forgiven for wondering what would become of their club when two Hollywood stars decided to buy it in 2021.But Reynolds and McElhenney have won them over by embracing its traditions and ensuring its identity has not fundamentally changed, even with the influx of new fans from around the world.",
        "\u201cThis is world class, fantastic,\u201d said Wrexham native Darren Jackson. \u201cThey\u2019ve done it the right way. It\u2019s still the same club, but all this is brilliant.\u201dGareth Bale may have turned down what was a tongue-in-cheek attempt to lure him off the golf course, but Reynolds and McElhenney are serious about their plans to keep pushing this club higher and higher.",
        "Promotion to League One is the target now.If they reach their goal, there will be another parade in Wrexham this time next year."
