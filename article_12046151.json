        "Sir Richard Branson has revealed his Virgin empire lost \u00a31.5 billion during the coronavirus pandemic as he feared he would \u201close everything\u201d.",
        "The British entrepreneur, who is thought to be worth \u00a34.2 billion and lives on a private Caribbean island, defended his decision to ask the Government for a Covid loan.Speaking to Amol Rajan for a BBC documentary, Sir Richard said: \u201cIt (the pandemic) cost us a big percentage of our net worth, maybe \u00a31.5 billion.\u201cThere was a time where it really looked like we were going to lose everything.",
        "\u201cWe have 50, 60 planes all on the ground at Heathrow and Gatwick, Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. And the health clubs all closed, the hotels all closed.\u201cThe worst would have been 60,000 people out on the streets.\u201dHe said the group sold shares in companies that were public to save money, which meant \u201cmost jobs were saved as a result\u201d.Sir Richard came under fire in 2020 when he asked the Government for help to keep his airline Virgin Atlantic afloat, in the form of a commercial loan.He insisted he did not have billions in \u201ccash in a bank account ready to withdraw\u201d to save the business, as his net worth was calculated on the value of Virgin businesses prior to the pandemic.But he told the BBC the media coverage at the time was \u201cpainful\u201d and re-emphasised that he was not looking for \u201cgifts from Government, but underwriting loans\u201d.",
        "Virgin Atlantic eventually secured a \u00a31.2 billion bailout involving only private funds, including \u00a3200 million from the wider Virgin Group.",
        "Earlier this month, Sir Richard\u2019s satellite launch company, Virgin Orbit, filed for bankruptcy and axed 675 jobs \u2013 about 85% of the workforce.It came after a rocket failed to complete the first satellite launch from UK soil in January.Other businesses in the Virgin empire have come up against difficulties, with gym chain Virgin Active taking a hit during the pandemic, but raising \u00a388 million from investors last year to help with its recovery.Elsewhere in the BBC interview, Sir Richard said he gives the money he earns to charities. and defended his tax status, with his primary residence being on his Caribbean island meaning he does not have to pay some UK taxes.\u201cAll I can say is we have paid billions and billions in taxes over the years, and will continue to do so, and our companies pay taxes in whichever country and whichever jurisdiction they\u2019re based,\u201d he said."
