        "Meghan\u2019s Aquazzura obsession began long before meeting her prince.Aquazzura, founded in 2012, was not a household name when Meghan started wearing the shoes.\u00a0For her engagement photocall, she wore the label\u2019s \u00a3490 suede Matilde heels, and white Aquazzuras for the evening reception at her wedding.And while it's not the first time the Princess of Wales has worn the brand, it's certainly the first time she has stepped out in the black\u00a0Bow Tie Pump 105 heels, which Meghan wore a number of times during her time in the royal family.\u00a0She first wore the heels for the\u00a0Queen's Young Leaders reception in June 2018, shortly after her wedding.\u00a0",

Born in Colombia and raised in Miami and London, he studied at the London College of Fashion and, at 23, worked for Roberto Cavalli.Two years on, he set up Aquazzura \u2014 its HQ is in Florence \u2014 and the brand is known for bold patterns and metallics.\u00a0",

The pineapple is a symbol of hospitality.\u2018Then I discovered that in Asian cultures, the gold pineapple is a symbol of good fortune.\u2019King Charles III and senior royals including the Princess of Wales were all smiles at a Buckingham Palace lunch for VIPs today as excitement ramped up with less than 24 hours until Britain's first Coronation for 70 years.",
