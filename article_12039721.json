        "Scientists are on the hunt for \u201csuper memorisers\u201d to take part in a new study about people with exceptional memories.",
        "Academics from the University of Cambridge are trying to uncover why some people are much better at remembering than others.Anyone who believes they have an exceptional memory is being urged to take an online survey and memory test. We\u2019re looking for anyone who thinks they might be a \u2018super memoriser\u2019 to try out our memory tests  Study lead Professor Sir Simon Baron-Cohen  Based on their performance, some will be invited to Cambridge to have a brain scan so researchers can examine the images in detail to assess whether there are any differences in structure or function.\u201cMemory is one of the best understood psychological processes in terms of brain networks and yet we still don\u2019t really know why some people have exceptional memories. That\u2019s why we\u2019re inviting people to take part in our study,\u201d said Professor Jon Simons from the Department of Psychology at the University of Cambridge.The researchers are also aiming to discover whether people who are autistic or neurodiverse are more likely to have an exceptional memory.",
        "The team have previously worked with writer Daniel Tammet, who is autistic and has synaesthesia and can recall the number pi to 22,514 digits.Professor Sir Simon Baron-Cohen, director of the Autism Research Centre at Cambridge University and lead investigator of the study, said: \u201cYou don\u2019t need to have won any competitions to take part or to consider yourself neurodiverse \u2013 and you certainly don\u2019t need to be able to recite pi to 22,000 digits.",
        "\u201cWe\u2019re looking for anyone who thinks they might be a \u2018super memoriser\u2019 to try out our memory tests.\u201dDr Carrie Allison, also from the Autism Research Centre, added: \u201cWe hope that people will enjoy taking part in this study and in the process contribute to helping us understand more about memory and whether exceptional memory is related to autism.\u201cFor decades, autism research has focused on disability, but this study is a wonderful opportunity to focus on strengths.\u201d\u2013 People aged 16 to 60 who wish to take part in the online memory tests \u2013 such as memorising a phone number or patterns on a chess board \u2013 can visit: https://cambridge.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_eFYFJCUtGpbc3RA"
