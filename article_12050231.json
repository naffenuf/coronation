        "Thousands of people have been denied the chance to vote in local elections by new ID rules, campaigners have claimed.",
        "Compulsory photo identification was required for the first time yesterday to cast ballots for local councillors.But the Electoral Commission has admitted some people were unable to vote because they did not arrive with the correct documents to allow them to enter the booths.Tom Brake, a former Lib Dem MP who now runs Unlock Democracy, which leads a coalition of groups including the Electoral Reform Society, Fair Vote UK and Open Britain against the imposition of Voter ID, said: 'Today has been a dark day for British democracy.\u00a0'Reports from all over the country confirm our very worst fears of the impact of the disastrous policy which has been made worse by the shambolic way it has been introduced.'One voter turned away is one too many, but early estimates point to many thousands of people being turned away and denied their right to vote.'Electoral Commission chairman John Pullinger told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'Firstly we do need to gather data before we get a really proper picture of the impact of voter ID, but I was out and about yesterday and I saw people being turned away, and we know some people were unable to cast their vote because they didn't have the right documents.'",
        "'Everyone who has the right vote should be able to cast their vote, and we need to get underneath the challenges they have faced.'",
        "On whether to widen the number of accepted forms of ID, Mr Pullinger said: 'Once we've done our assessment there'll be the chance for politicians to make a view as to whether something should be changed or not.'The requirement for voter ID has been controversial, with critics arguing it would deter young people and ethnic minorities from voting.James Toft, 41, who was unable to vote in Chesterfield yesterday morning as he had forgotten his photo ID, described the requirement as 'silly'.Mr Toft believes the new rules could be detrimental to people voting, telling the PA news agency: 'They'll take a look at what you need to do and just not bother voting, especially the younger ones.'What about the less well-off who can't afford a passport or other forms [of identification]?'Meanwhile, Gillian Long, 42, said ID requirements were 'a load of rubbish' after she was stopped from voting by an administration error between her ID and the registration system in East Yorkshire.Ms Long told PA: 'Luckily I was quite determined to vote, so I decided to question it. I called my other half to warn him before he goes to vote this evening that our address is wrong, and he said he's not going to bother voting.'",
        "She added: 'If you want people to vote, you should make it as easy as possible, and they've added a barrier.'Shortly after the polls closed, a spokesperson for the Electoral Commission said: 'Our initial assessment is that overall, the elections were well run.'But they added: 'We already know from our research that the ID requirement posed a greater challenge for some groups in society, and that some people were regrettably unable to vote today as a result.'The change was piloted regionally before the national rollout for yesterday's elections and it will come into force for general elections from October.The policy is opposed by Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Green Party. But the Government argues the change is required to reduce electoral fraud.Voters in Northern Ireland are already required to present photo ID at elections.The Electoral Commission expects to publish its initial analysis of the implementation of voter ID in June, subject to data being available."
