Hamilton finished second in Australia at the beginning of last month to raise hope of a Mercedes fightback.But the 38-year-old, whose contract with the Brackley team expires in just over six months, was a distant sixth in Azerbaijan last weekend.And, despite an encouraging opening practice session on Friday, with Russell leading his team-mate in a Mercedes one-two, the Silver Arrows look poised for another troubling weekend.Hamilton ended the concluding running before qualifying 1.1 seconds slower than Verstappen. Russell outpaced his team-mate by 0.1 sec.Mercedes are due to introduce an upgrade at the next round in Imola in a fortnight\u2019s time, but team principal Toto Wolff has already warned Hamilton that he will not have the speed to fight with Red Bull.",
