It's sitting by himself in a pot all by his lonesome.\u00a0",
        "Multiple pots have little friends to keep them company, but some cacti are better off on their own and enjoy a studio pot all to themselves.\u00a0Like this foreigner, he likes to harvest in his own pot, but is enjoying his time among his cacti friends, as indicated by the little smile on his face.\u00a0Still can't find him? Need a second hint?\u00a0He's south of the killer cactus, but close enough to be able to see two others screaming in terror.\u00a0Still can't find the apple of your eye?\u00a0Scroll down to see the solution."
