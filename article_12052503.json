I have to make sure that there is no chance that my devices are being tracked. If my location was being monitored 24/7, that\u2019s not just limited to my actions at work... this was in my personal life as well.\u2019ByteDance has said it \u2018deeply regrets\u2019 the \u2018significant violation\u2019 of its rules and fired those involved.Asked about the incident in March ahead of a US congressional committee, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew claimed: \u2018I don\u2019t think that spying is the right way to describe it.\u2019"
