        "Tunisian club Esperance will host Egyptian outfit Al Ahly behind closed doors in a CAF Champions League semi-final on May 12 after crowd trouble in the previous round.",
        "A Confederation of African Football (CAF) statement released on Saturday said the Tunis outfit must stage their next two matches in continental competitions without spectators.The four-time winners of the Champions League -- the premier African club competition -- have also been fined $300,000.Esperance said they will appeal the sanctions, believing they are \"too severe\", after clashes between some of their supporters and riot police in Rades near Tunis last weekend.In a move still to be explained, some spectators tried to invade the pitch at half-time during a quarter-final second leg against Algerian club JS Kabylie.There had been no goals during the first half, leaving Esperance leading 1-0 on aggregate in the north African showdown.While police prevented an invasion of the pitch, some were injured by various objects hurled at them.Tear gas was fired into a section of the crowd and order was eventually restored with the second half kicking off 45 minutes behind schedule. The return match ended in a 1-1 draw."
