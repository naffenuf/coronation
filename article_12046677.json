        "James Bond author Charlie Higson has said that if an actor is talked about as \u201cbeing considered\u201d as the next 007 \u201cyou know that they\u2019ve been rejected\u201d.",
        "The 64-year-old, who is also an actor, on Thursday released On His Majesty\u2019s Secret Service \u2013 a Bond adventure set two days before the King\u2019s coronation.Commissioned by Ian Fleming Publication, the novel will celebrate the coronation and tell the story of Bond being tasked with thwarting a last-minute attempt to disrupt the ceremony by a new villain, the eccentric Athelstan of Wessex.When asked if he has heard anything about who the next actor to play Bond could be following the departure of Daniel Craig after 2021\u2019s No Time To Die, Higson told PA news agency: \u201cAs soon as the papers say, so and so is being considered as the next James Bond, you know that they\u2019re not going to be the next James Bond, you know that they\u2019ve been rejected.\u201cEon (Productions) who make the films play their cards very close to the chest and a lot of times they really surprise people\u2026 in particular, Daniel Craig, nobody had any idea at all that he might be Bond and if you\u2019d been asked in advance, you\u2019d have said, \u2018Daniel Craig, James Bond, surely not\u2019.\u201cBut then he\u2019s just so good in Casino Royale\u2026 any doubts you might have had immediately go out the window, so they\u2019re pretty clever on that front and they will inevitably wait to make the announcement at the right time to get the maximum amount of publicity.\u201d",
        "Higson, who has written for the Young Bond series, said he would opt for Happy Valley star James Norton as he is a \u201cfantastic actor\u201d that can play \u201ctough as well as sensitive\u201d and is \u201cgood looking\u201d but not in a \u201csort of classical male model way\u201d.His book comes 60 years after the publication of James Bond creator Ian Fleming\u2019s tenth novel, On Her Majesty\u2019s Secret Service, which was published in 1963.Fleming\u2019s first novel Casino Royale was published in 1953, the year of the late Queen\u2019s coronation, and the royal family have continued to be associated with Bond, often attending 007 film premieres.",
        "The late Queen also famously featured alongside Craig during a skit for the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics when someone dressed as the monarch was seen jumping out of a helicopter.Higson, also known for creating and starring in The Fast Show in the 1990s, said: \u201cCharles is reputedly a James Bond fan\u2026 most of us from that generation, James Bond was such a huge part of our growing up\u2026\u201cI\u2019ve had some dealings with Queen Camilla, she\u2019s involved in the National Literacy Trust, which is the charity that the proceeds (of the book) are going to.\u201cWhen I meet her again, I might, if the opportunity arrives, I might ask her, if it\u2019s true, that Charles is a James Bond fan.\u201d",
        "When Queen Elizabeth II was celebrating children\u2019s authors during one of her birthdays, Higson recalled meeting her and Prince Philip, the late Duke of Edinburgh.He said: \u201cPhilip sort of came along\u2026 mopping up behind her, and he said, \u2018Oooh, what is it that you do then?\u2019\u201cI said, \u2018Oh I\u2019m writing a series of books about the young James Bond\u2019 and he said, \u2018Oh he\u2019d probably have got an Asbo, wouldn\u2019t he?\u2019 I thought (that) was quite funny off the cuff.\u201dAll royalties from the sale of On His Majesty\u2019s Secret Service will go towards supporting the National Literacy Trust, which works with schools and communities to provide disadvantaged children with the literacy skills they need to succeed.The book is available digitally as an eBook, as an audiobook \u2013 read by Higson \u2013 and as a hardback, online and in bookshops."
