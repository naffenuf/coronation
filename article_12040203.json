        "Further delays have been announced to the Snowy Hydro 2.0 scheme, with it likely being until the end of the decade before work is completed.* Project was announced by then-prime minister Malcolm Turnbull in 2017, with an initial price tag of $2 billion.* It was originally forecast that work would be built by 2021, but deadline would be pushed back to 2026.* The expansion of Snowy Hydro was officially approved in 2019, with estimated costs at more than $5 billion.* Workers on the project raised concern in 2022 about mice and rats in their food, as well as safety concerns and issues with sleeping quarters.* Workers on Snowy Hydro 2.0 threatened to walk off the job earlier this year due to working conditions.* A truck rollover on the site in April 2023 killed a worker in his 50s.* Delays have been compounded by one of its tunnel boring machines being stuck 70 metres below the surface. The machine became stuck after it unexpectedly hit soft rock, causing a tunnel collapse. So far, only one per cent of tunnelling has been completed.* Its chief executive Paul Broad quit in August 2022 after clashes with Energy Minister Chris Bowen on the project.* Dennis Barnes then named as new chief executive, who said on Wednesday the project would be delayed by a further two years.",
        "* Work on the project is now expected to be completed between 2028 and 2029, with Mr Barnes also citing increasing supply and labour costs as well as COVID-induced delays."
