        "Ryan Mason paid tribute to the collective after Tottenham claimed a first clean sheet in the Premier League since February.",
        "Harry Kane\u2019s first-half header, his 28th goal of the season, earned Spurs a 1-0 win over Crystal Palace on Saturday that kept them in the hunt for a top-six finish.Kane moved ahead of Wayne Rooney into second on the all-time Premier League goal-scorer list with his 209th top-flight strike but it was the other end of the pitch where Tottenham\u2019s improvement was noticeable.After conceding six at Newcastle and four at Liverpool during the last two weekends, Mason used his full week on the training pitch to tweak the 3-4-3 system used for the best part of 18 months since Antonio Conte took over.Spurs went with a back four out of possession and it worked to good effect after Palace were limited to minimal chances with the hosts able to register a first league clean sheet since February 26 versus Chelsea.\u201cWhen you keep a clean sheet, it\u2019s a collective. It\u2019s everyone and everyone fought for the clean sheet,\u201d Mason said.",
        "\u201cThe players on the pitch but also the ones who didn\u2019t because in the training week we\u2019ve all worked hard together and they\u2019re the results you want.\u201cWe understand the importance of the win and the clean sheet as well is a great response from the players because maybe mentally when you concede so many goals in a short space of time, it can have an impact but the players have worked hard.",
        "\u201cThe whole squad has worked hard on the training pitch. We\u2019ve had a bit of time together to try and influence things and they responded. I thought it was a cagey game but overall we deserved the three points.\u201dSpurs have spent the whole of this season using a 3-4-3 system but Cristian Stellini, who stepped up from assistant to replace Conte, went with a back four at Newcastle last month.It ended up having disastrous consequences with Tottenham 5-0 down inside 21 minutes and Stellini ultimately losing his job as acting head coach as a result.Mason hinted upon taking charge it would be hard for him to make changes for the Manchester United and Liverpool fixtures, but after a week on the training ground reverted to a back four, which he used in his previous caretaker spell in 2021.He added: \u201cWe added a sixth man into the press and tried to be a bit more aggressive.\u201cI have to compliment the players because when you\u2019ve been working in a certain way for so long, to make that change at this stage of the season it\u2019s very positive for me.\u201d We didn\u2019t have the success we had last week or the weeks before, but that\u2019s a credit to Tottenham deciding to defend as they did against us.  Crystal Palace boss Roy Hodgson  ",
        "Roy Hodgson, who watched Crystal Palace lose for only a second time since his return, acknowledged the respect Spurs had given the visitors with their formation.\u201cI saw us on the ball for large periods of the game and I saw us attempting to get into the right areas,\u201d he said.\u201cWe didn\u2019t have the success we had last week (against West Ham) or the weeks before, but that\u2019s a credit to Tottenham deciding to defend as they did against us.\u201cIt\u2019s never easy to find that bit of space when there are a lot of players in and around the box.\u201d"
