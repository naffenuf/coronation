        "Food has always played a part in the crowning of a new monarch \u2014 especially when that monarch, like King Charles, is such a staunch supporter of British farming and produce.We\u2019ll be hosting more than 100,000 Coronation Big Lunches \u2014 part of a community project of which Camilla is patron \u2014 and in excess of 50,000 street parties across the UK over the weekend.As such, scones, clotted cream, cucumbers, shortbread, sausage rolls and ingredients for Victoria sponge cakes are all flying off supermarket shelves as millions of us stock up for the big day.If you\u2019re one of the many millions ringing in the celebrations, there\u2019s one dish that\u2019s guaranteed to impress \u2014 and make a stunning centrepiece for your Coronation table: an edible crown.",
        "The ultimate royal recipe, there are numerous variations for you to try: Mary Berry makes hers out of scones; Bake Off winner Nadiya Hussain\u2019s is filled with ham and cheese; Jamie Oliver uses suet and root vegetables. Last week, Cadbury even created one entirely out of chocolate.But one edible crown truly has the royal seal of approval \u2014 and it looks uncannily similar to the 360-year-old St Edward\u2019s Crown that will be placed on Charles\u2019 head on Saturday.Made by cheesemakers at Long Clawson Dairy in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, the recipe comprises a 2kg wheel of their award-winning 1912 stilton, a bunch of grapes (in place of purple ermine), puff pastry artifice and pomegranate and pecan \u2018jewels\u2019.",
        "\u2018The recipe came about because the King is a big supporter of stilton and British cheese, and stilton is often referred to as the \u201cKing of Cheeses\u201d,\u2019 explains master cheesemaker Kim Kettle.Indeed, when Charles visited the dairy in 1985 and 2012 he was fascinated by the cheesemaking process, and let slip that he\u2019s a huge fan of stilton, so it\u2019s likely to be on the menu at the Palace this weekend, too.Here\u2019s your guide to making your own Coronation cheese crown \u2014 as well as a host of other recipes worthy of a royal feast to remember . . .",
        "How to make your own cheese crownThe ultimate Coronation centrepiece, this is a showstopping cheeseboard with a regal twist.IngredientsOne large wheel of stilton / other British blue cheese (about 2kg), plus 1 small wedge to grateTwo rolls puff pastry\u00a0One egg\u00a0Bunch red grapesOne packet pecan nutsOne pomegranateMethodGrate the smaller wedge of stilton.Unroll the puff pastry and sprinkle one half with half the grated cheese. Fold it over lengthways so that the cheese is inside and press down tightly.Use a sharp knife to cut the pastry lengthways into four strips. Repeat with the other roll.Rotate each strip of pastry between your fingers at either end until it forms a twist.Line a baking tray with greaseproof paper. Place a large, ovenproof bowl (with a diameter at least as wide as your wheel of stilton) on top.Place two pastry twists around the base of the bowl, joined at the ends to make a circle. Repeat with another two twists on top.",
        "Use the other four twists to make a cross on top of the bowl, cutting off any excess, and press together tightly to join at the top and base.Use any extra bits of pastry to make adornments for your crown: jewels, crosses and an orb for the top. Space these well apart on the baking tray.Whisk the egg in a small bowl and brush the pastry all over.Put in an oven preheated to 180c/fan 160/gas 4) and bake for 30 minutes or until all the pastry is puffed and golden.Leave everything to cool completely before assembling your crown.Place the stilton in the centre of a serving platter, topped with a bunch of grapes. Carefully transfer the pastry crown on top, using cocktail sticks to secure any gaps or stick on any pastry adornments.Top with pomegranate seed jewels, pecan nuts around the base and any other edible d\u00e9cor (from silver n balls to gold lustre spray) you want.

The herbs and flowers you use to decorate the cakes are completely up to you and obviously dependent on what (unsprayed, untreated) herbs and edible flowers you can get your hands on. You can just keep adding these; restraint goes out of the window in this instance. More is more.\u00a0",

        "Ingredients\u00a0Cakes:200g salted butter, plus more, melted, for the cake cases\u00a0220g icing sugar\u00a080g plain flour\u00a0Two tsps baking powder\u00a0150g ground almonds\u00a0200g egg whites\u00a024 raspberriesFor the frosting:\u00a0250g mascarpone\u00a0120g strained Greek yoghurt\u00a080g extra-thick or regular double cream, whipped to firm peaks\u00a050g icing sugar, sifted\u00a0Finely grated zest of \u00bd orange\u00a0One tsp orange blossom water\u00a0To assemble:\u00a0Icing sugarMixed herbs, edible blossoms and petals\u00a0MethodFirst, make the cakes. Heat the butter in a saucepan over a medium heat. Wait for it to stop foaming, stirring regularly until the pan is filled with flecks of a hazelnut colour and the butter smells nutty. This is beurre noisette: brown butter.Once it is a nice deep golden colour, pour it into a bowl, including the sediment, to cool to room temperature.Sift the icing sugar, flour and baking powder into the bowl of a food mixer, then stir in the almonds.Gradually whisk in the brown butter, then gradually add the egg whites. Chill for 1 hour.Preheat the oven to 190c/170c fan/gas 5. Line a muffin tin with eight paper cases and brush each with butter.Fill each case one-quarter full with the batter, then push three raspberries into the centre of each. Add more batter until each case is three-quarters full.Bake for 15 minutes, then leave to cool for five minutes. Remove the cakes from the trays and paper cases and leave them upside down on a wire rack. This will flatten the tops slightly, which will make the piping easier.\u00a0For the frosting, lightly whisk everything together, with a folding rather than a beating motion. (Mascarpone and yoghurt become runny if over-whipped and the mix should remain firm.)\u00a0Transfer to a piping bag fitted with a star-shaped nozzle if you have one. Leave to chill in the refrigerator. T",
        "o assemble, dust the cakes, with icing sugar. Pipe the frosting generously on top, squeezing the bag firmly. Place the herbs and flowers on top, to create height and volume.Taken from Essential, by Ollie Dabbous (Bloomsbury Absolute).Ainsley Harriott\u2019s cheese and greens breakfast muffinsThe smell of savoury breakfast muffins baking in the morning is delightful. These are truly moreish and are actually good for any time of the day. Delicious with soup and perfect for picnics, the muffins are also a great way to get your kids to eat some greens. You can really mix up the greens too \u2014 when in season I love to throw in a handful of wild garlic, or a mix of spinach and watercress is nice, as it adds a peppery twist. As a treat, sometimes I swap the seeds on top for a little crispy bacon.Makes 12 muffins",
