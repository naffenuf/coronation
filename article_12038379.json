        "Steve Smith is excited to gain his first taste of County Championship cricket after \u201cthe stars aligned\u201d to give him the chance to play for Sussex ahead of the Ashes.",
        "The Australia batter will play three games for the club in May starting with the trip to Worcestershire on Thursday, before games at Leicestershire and at home to Glamorgan.The first Ashes Test will begin at Edgbaston on June 16, and some critics have questioned whether it could damage England\u2019s chances giving Smith the opportunity to have game time in the country in the weeks leading up.",
        "Sussex coach Paul Farbrace dismissed the suggestion that it could put Australia at an advantage and said having a player of the 33-year-old\u2019s calibre in the County Championship can only be good for English cricket.Smith\u2019s arrival has been a coup for Sussex after they finished seventh in Division Two last season, and despite having served a 12-month ban from cricket for his role in Australia\u2019s ball-tampering scandal in 2018, he remains an elite player.Last year he announced he had elected not to take part in this year\u2019s Indian Premier League (IPL).\u201cI\u2019m excited by the next couple of weeks,\u201d said Smith. \u201cI originally didn\u2019t put my name in the IPL auction. Particularly coming off the Test series there, I\u2019ve done that a couple of times and it\u2019s very long, having the IPL on the back of it.\u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of cricket coming up and a window opened up to come and play some county cricket. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve never done and have always wanted to do, so the stars aligned in a way.",
        "\u201cWe are over here for the English summer and it\u2019s a good opportunity to play some county cricket, which is something I\u2019ve wanted to do for a long time. I\u2019m excited.\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s career-defining, not sure about that. It\u2019s certainly going to be a good couple of months. I\u2019m excited by everything that is coming up.\u201cI\u2019m just looking forward to getting a few games in here for Sussex where hopefully I can have an impact on some younger players and the team has started really well this year. Hopefully get some good results and help Sussex win some games of cricket.\u201dFarbrace was emphatic that Smith\u2019s presence was a sign of the growing appeal of the County Championship.England captain Ben Stokes in January questioned his involvement so close to the start of the Ashes, saying: \u201cI think it\u2019s one of those where you would probably prefer them (Australian players) not to get any game time out here before the Ashes.\u201d",
        "But the Sussex coach insisted the club have not compromised England\u2019s chances of winning a first series since 2015 after failing to regain the urn at the last three attempts.\u201cSport is all about opinions,\u201d said Farbrace. \u201cThat\u2019s what we love about the game. I\u2019ve got very strong views on Chelsea. The fact that people are talking about Championship cricket is only good for the game.",
        "\u201cI\u2019ve got good friends who think that we\u2019re helping Australia to win the Ashes. We\u2019re not at all. I think this is really good for English cricket.\u201cIt was a very easy decision and conversation with Rob Andrew the CEO. We both realise it\u2019s about trying to create this winning mentality and a culture within our set-up that we expect to win.\u201dOf his side\u2019s chances of winning this summer, Smith added: \u201cEngland just play tremendous cricket at home all the time. We generally play pretty well at home as well. Anyone who plays at home knows the conditions a lot better.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a terrific summer. Both teams are playing good cricket, different brands of cricket.\u201d"
