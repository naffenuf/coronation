'You are working for a family business.\u00a0'Why pay that salary if you are in Europe while our teachers and students are deputing the most important term of the year?'Wow. Big misunderstanding between us about role and responsibilities of a Dean and Principal.'I gave instructions to cut accesses an deal with termination effective today (aka date I realized). We'll deal with that when you are back in Australia.'\u00a0Later the same day Ms Webster received written notification she had been terminated with immediate effect, court documents state.",
        "Professor Bebbington sent an email to LCI Melbourne's board of directors on February 7 which according to Ms Webster's claim read in part: 'I write to advise that our parent company LCI Education Network has deemed the employment of Karen Webster as our Dean and Principal in Melbourne has come to an end, with immediate effect.''As such, we need to give effect to this decision. She will be paid her entitlements under the termination provisions of her contract.'\u00a0",
