        "'We need to do different things obviously to get out of [this]. I don't know what. We need to figure it out, but we cannot keep doing the same things and waiting for the same results,' Hernandez said.'It's very frustrating, man. I don't know what else to say.'\u00a0The Galaxy have recorded only one win in their first 10 games of the season and currently sit 13th in Major League Soccer's Western Conference with a record of 1-3-6.'We need so many things to change starting from, I believe that more people need to come [speak to the media] to face things. We're the same people speaking, always,' the Mexican striker added.\u00a0",
        "'That's a thing that needs to change too, you know? We always speak in here, the same guys. So I think that should change in the beginning, and then on the training ground other stuff needs to change. Something needs to change, man.\u00a0'We need to be accountable. We need to see that the reality is not in the way that we are doing. We cannot say things are going to turn around doing the same things.

When I say we need to behave and understand that \u2013 they're giving you the chance to be the greatest,' Hernandez said.\u00a0'You're in the greatest f***ing organization in the USA. At the least, you give everything. And if teams are better than us, I can take that, I can take those losses. I can take that.''When El Trafico happened, we were way better. We beat ourselves. We were the better team and we lost. I take those ones. These ones, at home? Against a [conference] rival? Man, no. Not good enough. Not good enough. And yeah, the fans were right this time. They're right.'\u00a0"
