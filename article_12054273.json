Officer Asad Abbas said the bodyguard was wounded in the attack.The police declined to explain why Singh had a bodyguard or provide further details. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.Religious minorities often face violence in Muslim-majority Pakistan, even though the country\u00b4s Constitution guarantees them equal rights and the freedom to practice their faith.Last month, a Pakistani Sikh businessman and a Christian cleaner were shot and killed by gunmen in separate incidents in the northwestern city of Peshawar. A day earlier, a prominent Hindu doctor and eye surgeon was gunned down in the port city of Karachi."
