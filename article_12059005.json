        "Jorginho's leadership helped Arsenal beat Newcastle 2-0 at St James' Park\u00a0The Italian midfielder's poise and control was vital to helping the Gunners winWhile Odegaard scored the first goal, he handed his MOTM award to the Italian\u00a0St James' Park was shedding all of the colour and noise of the previous 90 minutes when Mikel Arteta wandered towards the tunnel to continue the Arsenal celebrations. He wore a beaming smile and his arm was draped around the shoulders of Jorginho.",
        "It was no coincidence and no surprise that, as the Gunners celebrated three points that kept their title hopes alive, Arteta sought out the midfielder.Martin Odegaard will rightly take the plaudits for his goal and the way he dragged his side into a game that looked set to overwhelm them for a second straight season.\u00a0At full-time here, however, the Arsenal captain handed over the man-of-the-match award to Jorginho.\u00a0This was the 31-year-old\u2019s second start in a week. A second fine performance, too, in a second vital win for Arsenal\u2019s lingering title chase.\u00a0",
        "It is days like this that prove quite how shrewd his \u00a312million January signing was.\u00a0Yes, the control and physicality offered by Thomas Partey has been one of the pillars of Arsenal\u2019s season.\u00a0Recently, though, as Partey\u2019s performances have nosedived, Jorginho has proven that he can play a different but no less vital role. He ended this match with more touches, more completed passes, more recoveries and more clearances than any of his team-mates.\u2018We are two different players that can adapt for the coach in different games,\u2019 the Italy international said.\u00a0\u2018I think the coach has two good choices and depending on what game, and what type of players he wants on the pitch.\u2019\u00a0In the black-and-white heat of St James\u2019 Park, his leadership and poise was pivotal.\u00a0",
        "Always happy to receive the ball under pressure. Always dishing out advice and instructions. Always conducting play and organising Arsenal\u2019s shape.\u00a0Jorginho was bought for challenges like these \u2013 to provide control amid the chaos.\u00a0He shone against Chelsea in midweek, when Arsenal controlled the ball and picked off Frank Lampard\u2019s side.\u00a0He excelled here, too, in rather more taxing circumstances. During those early minutes, when Newcastle threatened to drown the visitors, it seemed Jorginho\u2019s frailties would be laid bare.That the likes of Joelinton and Joe Willock would expose his lack of dynamism and physicality.\u00a0",
        "But Odegaard\u2019s opening goal changed everything. It laid the foundations for a Jorginho masterclass and proved once more the value of squad depth.\u00a0When form or fitness deserts one key player, Arsenal need others to fill those holes.\u00a0Now, heading into their final three games, Jorginho has cemented himself as first choice. Will Arteta live to rue not bringing him in earlier?Gunners reshuffled defence gets the plaudits\u00a0\u00a0A first clean sheet in nine games for Arsenal.\u00a0On one of the Premier League\u2019s toughest away days, too.For that, their reshuffled backline deserve immense credit and particular praise should go to Jakub Kiwior, who helped shackle Callum Wilson and shut out Newcastle.The Poland international has looked raw and rather rash on his rare outings since arriving in January for \u00a321.",
        "The 23-year-old thought he\u2019d given away a penalty when Chris Kavanagh decided he had handled Bruno Guimaraes\u2019 early shot.\u00a0But then VAR intervened, Arsenal turned the tide and Kiwior kept Wilson quiet.No mean feat given the striker had scored eight goals in seven games \u2013 a run that included only two starts.William Saliba won\u2019t be fearing for his place. But this was an encouraging afternoon nonetheless.Isak and Wilson fail to galvanise GeordiesEddie Howe\u2019s decision to unleash both Wilson and Alexander Isak didn\u2019t hurt Arsenal in the way the manager would have hoped.Wilson struggled to influence the game, while Isak looked threatening but didn\u2019t see enough of the ball on the left flank.\u00a0",
        "By starting both of them, Howe solved one selection dilemma.But he also created a problem, too: with both of them on from the start, the manager robs himself of the chance to introduce one late on as Newcastle try to lay siege.\u00a0Normally, when trailing with time running out, Howe would want to bring on a goal threat to galvanise their attack and to lift the crowd.Instead, a tiring Wilson was brought off with 12 minutes to play, replaced by Anthony Gordon - who has yet to open his Newcastle account That\u2019s the risk you run."
