        "Paddy Lane\u2019s first goal for Portsmouth helped seal eighth place in League One after a 2-2 draw with Wycombe at Fratton Park.",
        "After Marlon Pack had equalised following Garath McCleary\u2019s opener, Lane cancelled out Lewis Wing\u2019s stunning long-range strike to earn Pompey the point they needed to finish above their visitors.In an entertaining final game of the season, Pompey were the dominant side in the first half, yet it was Wycombe who opened the scoring in the 31st minute.A dreadful pass out from Josh Oluwayemi went straight to the feet of McCleary, who swept forward to power the ball under the goalkeeper\u2019s body.Pompey fought back and deservedly got the equaliser after 44 minutes as a second corner in as many minutes saw a Michael Jacobs cross headed in by Pack.The second half continued to entertain and Wing, with nowhere to go in the 54th minute, hammered home from 50 yards to put Wycombe ahead.",
        "But Pompey hit back with 18 minutes remaining when Lane fired in the leveller."
