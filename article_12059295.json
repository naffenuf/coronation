        "China\u2019s foreign minister has told the US ambassador that Washington is responsible for the downturn in relations between the two countries and must \u201creflect deeply\u201d before ties can get back \u201con the right track\u201d, an official said.",
        "Qin Gang\u2019s comments follow a suspension of serious dialogue on a range of issues between the world\u2019s largest economies, increasingly at odds over tariffs, attempts by Washington to deprive China of cutting-edge technology, and China\u2019s claims to self-governing Taiwan and large parts of the South and East China Seas.China\u2019s foreign ministry quoted Mr Qin as telling Ambassador Nicolas Burns that a \u201cseries of erroneous words and deeds by the US\u201d since a meeting in November between US president Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping \u201chave undermined the hard-won positive momentum of Sino-US relations\u201d.\u201cThe US side should reflect deeply, meet China halfway, and propel China/US relations out of the difficulties and back on the right track,\u201d Mr Qin was quoted as saying.The United States should \u201ccorrect its understanding of China and return to rationality\u201d, Mr Qin said, repeating his earlier accusation that the US was attempting to suppress and contain China.Beijing routinely cites US political and military support of Taiwan as infringing on its sovereignty.Mr Qin said ties had \u201cgrown icy\u201d and the priority was to stabilise them \u201cand avoid a downward spiral and unanticipated events\u201d.The US should stop \u201cundermining China\u2019s sovereignty, security, and development interests\u201d, particularly through support of Taiwan\u2019s independent identity, Mr Qin said.",
        "China says Taiwan must come under its rule, by force if necessary, while the United States says the relationship between the sides must be resolved peaceably.US law requires it to treat threats to Taiwan, including a military blockade, as a matter of \u201cgrave concern\u201d, although it remains ambiguous about under what conditions American forces could be dispatched to defend the island.Despite the lack of formal diplomatic relations, the US is Taiwan\u2019s largest supplier of military hardware and diplomatic support, even while it continues to maintain relations with Beijing.Mr Biden has been seen as going a step further by repeatedly saying that the US would back Taiwan militarily, and America has been upgrading basing arrangements with the Philippines, located just south of Taiwan.US/China military contacts have been on hold for years, and China\u2019s top staff refused to answer a call from American defence secretary Lloyd Austin after then-speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan last year.China retaliated for the visit by staging a naval and air force blockade of Taiwan and cutting off channels of communication with the US on issues from environmental protection to maritime security.At a daily briefing Monday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin described the meeting between Mr Qin and Mr Burns as \u201ca normal diplomatic arrangement\u201d.",
        "In a tweet, Mr Burns said he met with Mr Qin and \u201cdiscussed challenges in the US/China relationship and the necessity of stabilising ties and expanding high-level communication\u201d.Contacts between the sides have been fraught for months since US secretary of state Antony Blinken abruptly cancelled a Beijing trip aimed at easing US/China tensions in February. This came after a large high-altitude Chinese balloon was shot down after it sailed across the US, drawing Pentagon accusations of spying on sensitive military sites despite firm Chinese denials."
