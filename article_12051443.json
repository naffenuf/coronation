        "He replied: 'Kev. But he's just like, you know, because of how good he is on a match day. He's just chilled in training.'The forward described\u00a0right-back\u00a0Kyle Walker as the 'best dressed', while defensive midfielder Rodri was the worst.The\u00a0Spanish footballer, 26, was also criticised for his taste in music as\u00a0centre-back John Stones was rated the best dancer.\u00a0Grealish said he was by far the worst dancer in the squad, but claimed to be a 'multigenre DJ'.",
        "Attacker Phil Foden was the best trainer and named as having\u00a0mind-blowing tekkers.Record-breaker\u00a0Erling Haaland, who is known for having some unusual habits, takes the longest in the shower and\u00a0centre-back\u00a0Ruben Dias spends the most time in the gym.It comes as City look to use Saturday's fixture against Leeds United to go four points clear of Arsenal at the top of the table.City will come up against Sam Allardyce as the 68-year-old takes charge of Leeds for the first time, having been brought in to try and save their Premier League status.\u00a0'Always there is an impact of a new manager on the players for the first one or two games,' Pep Guardiola said. 'Every team is playing for important things. Of course for Leeds to stay here, the impact is always huge.'I don't know how they play, we don't have any info, we will have to adapt quick after five, 10 minutes. We can imagine what he tries to do. It's a massive, important game for us.'When you don't have information on the opponent, you don't focus much on them. Focus more on you. You have to think about your team. We analyse the West Ham game to help us with the next game.'"
