        "The King and Queen have left Buckingham Palace to cheers from the waiting crowds in The Mall as the moment of their coronation drew closer.",
        "Charles and Camilla waved to thousands of spectators lining the street as leading figures began to join members of the congregation in Westminster Abbey.The list of 2,300 invited guests reads like a who\u2019s who of politics, showbusiness, world leaders and foreign royalty, with a sprinkling of everyday heroes and close family and friends of the King and his wife.French President Emmanuel Macron was attending to show his \u201cfriendship, respect and esteem\u201d for the UK, with US singer-songwriter Lionel Richie, The Repair Shop\u2019s Jay Blades, and the Prince and Princess of Wales and their children.The Duke of Sussex has arrived at the abbey, but the Duchess of Sussex has remained at home in the US.",
        "Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will give a reading, Charles\u2019s grandson and future head of state Prince George will act as one of his pages of honour alongside three other schoolboys, while Camilla will be attended by her three grandsons and her great-nephew.The 33-minute journey to Westminster Abbey began with the tri-service Guard of Honour outside Buckingham Palace\u2019s gates giving a royal salute, as the King and Queen\u2019s Diamond Jubilee Coach first emerged, and the national anthem was played by a military band.Huge Union flags and others from Commonwealth nations flew from poles in The Mall and Charles and Camilla\u2019s route was lined by guardsmen in their distinctive red tunics and bearskins.",
        "The Sovereign\u2019s Escort was led by the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment band, 48 horses and musicians with two drum horses Atlas and Apollo leading the way, playing eight marches along the route.Following were four divisions from the Household Cavalry with the King\u2019s coach in the middle \u2013 two from the Blues and Royals taking the lead and Life Guards behind the carriage with the farriers carrying their axes at the rear.Crowds had been building up in the capital since dawn with the streets around the procession route \u2013 The Mall, Admiralty Arch, Trafalgar Square, Whitehall and Parliament Square \u2013 thronged with people.",
        "Earlier, the King and Queen made their first appearance of coronation day when they travelled the short distance from their Clarence House home for final preparations at Buckingham Palace.The Duke of York was driven down The Mall in a state car, with parts of the crowd booing as he went past.Celebrity guests arrived at the abbey, including actress Dame Emma Thompson, musicians Lionel Richie and Nick Cave and a cheery-looking Ant and Dec, in their smart morning suits.Inside the ancient abbey, the church buzzed with noise as the congregation filed in and took their seats hours before the ceremony was due to start.A smiling Dean of Westminster, Dr David Hoyle, in his vivid red clerical robe was seen hurriedly carrying the holy oil for the anointing down the length of the abbey from the altar through the quire, clutching the precious ornate silver vessel in both hands.",
        "As anticipation mounted among royal fans, a group of republicans were arrested around 7.30am more than four hours before the coronation service began.Footage on Twitter showed Graham Smith, chief executive of the anti-monarchy group Republic, being apprehended by police in St Martin\u2019s Lane, Westminster.Pictures appeared to show demonstrators in yellow \u201cNot My King\u201d T-shirts, including Mr Smith, having their details taken by officers.Protest group Just Stop Oil also said approximately 13 demonstrators were arrested on The Mall, as well as five at Downing Street.The King will be crowned during a coronation ceremony dating back centuries.",
        "Cries of God Save the King will ring out around the abbey after St Edward\u2019s Crown is placed on Charles\u2019 head by Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby.The senior cleric said in a statement issued on the eve of the coronation that the ceremony served as \u201ca powerful reflection and celebration of who we are today, in all our wonderful diversity\u201d.He said people will be struck by the \u201cmajesty and sacred wonder\u201d of the service, but also hoped they would find \u201cancient wisdom and new hope\u201d.But in a change, the controversial \u201cHomage of the People\u201d element of the service has been toned down after there was widespread criticism of the new element.",
        "Mr Welby will now \u201cinvite\u201d a show of support from the congregation rather than a \u201ccall\u201d to those in the abbey and elsewhere to swear allegiance to the King.The event will bring together around 100 heads of state, kings and queens from across the globe, celebrities, everyday heroes and family and friends of the couple, with Charles\u2019 estranged son the Duke of Sussex expected to attend.Invited guests include David and Victoria Beckham, King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima of the Netherlands, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and US First Lady Jill Biden but her husband President Joe Biden will not be attending.The day will be a display of pomp and pageantry, with the nation\u2019s Armed Forces promising a \u201cspectacular\u201d event when the King and Queen process through the streets of the capital.The event is the military\u2019s largest ceremonial operation since Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s 1953 coronation, with 9,000 servicemen and women deployed and 7,000 of these performing ceremonial and supporting roles."
