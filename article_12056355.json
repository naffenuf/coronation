        "Plymouth Argyle secured the League One title with a 3-1 win against Port Vale\u00a0James Plant gave the hosts an early lead but the visitors hit back with three goalsWin sees the Pilgrims finish first ahead of Ipswich, who drew 2-2 with Fleetwood\u00a0As the champagne sprayed and 4,000 travelling fans danced in the stands, finally Plymouth Argyle had their moment.",
        "So much is made of Ipswich, Sheffield Wednesday and others in League One - those with the history, grandeur and bigger budgets - but it will be the Devon club going up to the second-tier as champions.Green dreams came true as this final afternoon victory over Port Vale saw Steven Schumacher's team smash a century of points and return to the Championship after 13 years away.A party that began when they secured promotion alongside Ipswich last weekend continued in a packed away end at Vale Park as goals by Adam Randall, Joe Edwards and Finn Azaz saw them from behind after James Plant's early opener.\u00a0It is an incredible achievement in a notoriously difficult division which has come to resemble a graveyard of former Premier League clubs.",
        "Even more so given the desperate position of the Pilgrims a decade ago when, amid crippling financial issues, Argyle only stayed in the Football League because relegation rivals also lost on the final day.\u00a0James Brent was the businessman who rescued the club before passing the reins to current owner Simon Hallett, whose shrewd leadership and financial backing propelled them to this point.The promotion of Schumacher when Ryan Lowe left for Preston in 2021 proved a masterstroke, his data-driven approach, and willingness to empower players to present tactical plans, completing the club's redemption.",
        "Despite all that, Plymouth's \u00a34million-a-season playing budget is dwarfed by Ipswich, Wednesday and many others in League One and will look even tinier in the Championship.",
        "Port Vale (4-3-3): Stone; Worrall, Smith, Donnelly (Cass 64), Benning; Plant (Shorrock 79), Ojo, Conlon (c); James A. Wilson (Taylor 64), Butterworth (Pett 57), Massey (Proctor 78).Subs not used: Stevens (GK); Politic.Goals: Plant 3.Interim Manager:\u00a0Andy Crosby.Plymouth (3-4-2-1): Burton; James S. Wilson, Scarr, Gillesphey; Edwards (c), Houghton, Randell, Mumba (Grant 84); Wright (Matete 72), Mayor (Azaz 45); Ennis (Hardie 61).Subs not used: Parkes (GK); Lonwijk, Cosgrove.Goals: Randell 34, Edwards 38, Azaz 61.Yellow cards: Azaz 81.Manager: Steven Schumacher.Referee: Simon Mather.Attendance: 11,998 (3,926 away).",
        "'The other clubs hat everyone has mentioned this season, they are bigger clubs than us historically,' Schumacher said. 'It doesn't matter.'We have gone about our business every single week, we have gone out to win our games and put in performances for our fans because the players care about this club. Now we're champions, we can't be ignored anymore.'For any club, to get over 100 points is a milestone so for us to do it under the intense pressure from Ipswich, Sheffield Wednesday and Barnsley all season, for us not to buckle when nobody fancied us, it can't be spoken of any higher. It's an unbelievable achievement.'",
        "Schumacher has a date with the needle after promising his daughter he'd get a tattoo if his team achieved 100 points and burst into laughter when reminded of it.The Plymouth supporters who'd been up since silly o'clock to make the 245-mile trip to the Potteries certainly made their presence felt.The car park outside the away end was a sea of green as they partied at 10am to tunes pumped out by a DJ. Once inside, they cheered anyone in their colours who emerged for the warm-ups and then cheered them back inside again.But the Green Army were silenced - for a short time at least - when Plant stormed through to score for Vale inside the opening three minutes.It owed everything to the vision of Danny Butterworth in midfield, spotting Plant's run beyond Macaulay Gillesphey down the right channel and playing the perfect pass.Plant got the better of Plymouth goalkeeper Callum Burton in the one-on-one to delight the Vale fans.Plymouth took some time to get going. Their first opportunity of note wasn't until the 18th minute when Bali Mumba headed back across goal and wide from Callum Wright's cross.But two well-taken goals in the space of five minutes flipped the game on its head and restored Plymouth to the summit.",
        "On 34 minutes, Argyle attacked down the left and Niall Ennis did just enough to keep the move flowing inside the box as Vale tried to scramble it away.",
        "The ball sat up perfectly for Randell on the edge of the box and he crashed it into the bottom corner.That sparked pandemonium, with a pall of green smoke briefly shrouding the away end, and that excitement had barely died down when Plymouth took the lead.This time they attacked from right to left, with Mumba working the ball on to Callum Wright, whose low ball across the Vale box was tempting.Just as it appeared to elude everyone, Plymouth's captain Edwards arrived at the back post to fire into an ever-narrowing gap.Even though Ipswich were only drawing at this point, Plymouth knew they might need an insurance goal and made the early second-half running.Randell curled an inswinging corner into a packed six-yard box and keeper Aiden Stone punched clear, before Mumba cleared the crossbar with a shot a few minutes later.Edwards then cleared the bar from point-blank range after good work by Finn Azaz, the Argyle midfielder getting a ticking off from the referee after claiming it should have been a corner.\u00a0Just after news filtered through that Fleetwood had equalised at 1-1 against Ipswich, Plymouth added their third.",
        "It was a cracking finish by Azaz, lifted high into the net from just inside the area after Wright cut inside on the right. He was possibly fouled but the referee played advantage and his pass found Azaz to score.Matty Taylor had a stoppage time header ruled out for offside but it would have been mere consolation anyway.\u00a0That was that. Plymouth are champions - and in what style."
