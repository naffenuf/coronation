        "A lawyer has told a jury in the US that Donald Trump should be held accountable for sexually attacking an advice columnist in 1996 because even a former president is not above the law.",
        "Roberta Kaplan delivered the first closing argument in the federal civil trial, showing jurors video clips of Mr Trump from his October deposition and replaying the Access Hollywood video from 2005 in which he said into a hot mic that celebrities could grab women\u2019s genitals without asking.Closing arguments were expected to last all day in the case as the jurors in Manhattan heard final remarks from lawyers about the claims writer E Jean Carroll has brought against Mr Trump.Ms Kaplan recalled Mr Trump\u2019s comment that \u201cstars like him can get away with sexually assaulting women\u201d.\u201cThat\u2019s who Donald Trump is. That is how he thinks. And that\u2019s what he does,\u201d Ms Kaplan said.\u201cHe thinks he can get away with it here.\u201dShe told jurors that it was not a \u201che said, she said\u201d case but rather one in which jurors should weigh what 11 witnesses, including Ms Carroll, said versus what they heard from Mr Trump in his video deposition.\u201cHe didn\u2019t even bother to show up here in person,\u201d Ms Kaplan said. In a very real sense, Donald Trump is a witness against himself. He knows what he did. He knows that he sexually assaulted E Jean Carroll  Lawyer Roberta Kaplan  She told jurors that much of what he said in his deposition and in public statements \u201cactually supports our side of the case\u201d.",
        "\u201cIn a very real sense, Donald Trump is a witness against himself,\u201d she said.\u201cHe knows what he did. He knows that he sexually assaulted E Jean Carroll.\u201dMr Trump, who has not attended the trial, has insisted in public statements and in the deposition that Carroll made up the claims to boost sales of a 2019 memoir.Carroll, 79, who is seeking compensatory and punitive damages, testified for more than two days during the trial, which is entering its third week.She said she had been leaving a Bergdorf Goodman store through a revolving door in spring 1996 when Mr Trump was entering the store and stopped her to help him shop for a gift for a woman.Ms Carroll said they eventually took escalators to the store\u2019s sixth floor, where they teased each other about trying on a piece of see-through lingerie.She said she entered a dressing room with Mr Trump before the flirtatious outing turned violent, with Mr Trump slamming her against a wall, pulling down her tights and raping her.She said she kneed him after an encounter that lasted several minutes and fled the store.Judge Lewis A Kaplan, who is unrelated to Ms Kaplan, told jurors they would begin deliberations on Tuesday after he spent about an hour reading them the law that would pertain to battery and defamation, the two allegations they must decide."
