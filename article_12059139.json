        "Well-placed sources said they were investigating the possibility deadly carbon monoxide gas had been seeping out all night while the couple slept in the main bedroom.The couple have not been officially named but the woman at the centre of the drama is understood to be an Edinburgh-based former bank worker.",

        "The nearest town to Cala Mesquida, famed for its beautiful sandy beach and popular with Germans and British, is Capdepera which is about five miles away.The house where the latest gas leak tragedy occurred has been described as a rural property.Unconfirmed local reports say it is owned by the dead man's father."
