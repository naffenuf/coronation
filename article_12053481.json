And like I said, I just wanted to apologize for that.\"The A's issued a statement on Twitter, \"The language used by Glen Kuiper during today's pregame broadcast is unacceptable. The Oakland Athletics do not condone such language. We are working to address the situation.\"Kuiper, 59, has been an announcer on A's games since 2004. His older brother, Duane, is a longtime San Francisco Giants announcer who played 12 seasons as a major league infielder.The Royals beat the A's 12-8 on Friday.--Field Level Media"
