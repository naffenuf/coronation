        "Dean Holden says Charlton must mount a League One promotion push next season after they signed off this term with a 2-2 draw at Cheltenham.",
        "Alfie May\u2019s late strike during an entertaining season finale denied Holden a winning end and he has demanded a big improvement in 2023/24.\u201cI don\u2019t know how we threw that game,\u201d Holden said. \u201cIt\u2019s a game we should\u2019ve won comfortably, but we conceded a cheap goal at the end.\u201cHaving said that, we had 10 academy players on the pitch today which is encouraging.\u201cWe have to be pushing at the top end of the table next season given the size of this club and we have to be fitter.\u201cWe had gilt-edged chances right throughout the game and so how we didn\u2019t win it I don\u2019t know.",
        "\u201cWe finished 10th in the league and so it\u2019s been a decent second half of the season, but collectively we\u2019ve not been good enough.\u201cThe players have to go away in the summer and use it wisely and come back fitter than they\u2019ve ever been.\u201dThe Addicks led through Scott Fraser\u2019s first-half strike, but Aidan Keena levelled for the Robins early in the second period.Substitute Jack Payne struck with seven minutes left to restore Charlton\u2019s advantage, but May\u2019s 20th League One goal of the season sealed a point for the Robins.Cheltenham boss Wade Elliott was happy after overseeing the club\u2019s second highest-ever placing of 16th in the EFL.",
        "\u201cIt was a good game, with two teams wanting to win it and I thought we were really good,\u201d he said.\u201cI thought we deserved to win it. It\u2019s really pleasing to see the connection between the players and fans at the end.\u201cThe fans can see they have a really genuine, honest group. It\u2019s been good, so make the most of it.\u201cWe\u2019ll enjoy the summer, take stock and we know it\u2019ll be tough against next season. We can\u2019t get blase about being at this level.\u201d"
