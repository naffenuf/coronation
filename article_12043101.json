        "The woman behind a sand drawing of the King\u2019s face that took six hours to create and measures 90ft by 65ft described her artwork as \u201csuper poignant\u201d.",
        "Claire Eason, from Sunderland, was a GP for more than 30 years but swapped medicine to concentrate on her sand art, creating the mammoth profile of Charles wearing a large crown.The 58-year-old said she was \u201cabsolutely humbled\u201d to create the art installation on Bamburgh Beach in Northumberland under the backdrop of Bamburgh Castle.Claire Watson-Armstrong, who owns Bamburgh Castle, contacted Ms Eason to create a special piece of art ahead of the King\u2019s coronation on May 6.",
        "\u201cI was absolutely humbled because Bamburgh Castle, for anybody who has grown up in the North East, is part of everybody\u2019s DNA, and everybody absolutely loves it. It\u2019s a real icon for the area,\u201d the sand artist told the PA news agency.\u201cBamburgh Castle has long been associated with Northumbrian kings going back thousands of years really\u2026 It\u2019s having that royal connection carried on to the present day, which seemed super poignant.\u201dMs Eason became inspired after the team at Bamburgh Castle showed her a picture of a textile piece of Charles\u2019s\u00a0 portrait made out of sequins.She adapted the piece and incorporated the natural ripples in the sand to create the King\u2019s face, paying homage to his advocacy for protecting the environment.\u201cWhat I wanted to do was to try and make a connection between the portrait and the coastal locations,\u201d she explained.",
        "\u201cThe stripes are to represent the sand striations that happen when the tide comes in and you get those lovely, sculptural, elongated bumps\u2026 So that was to echo the sand shapes left by the tide to make up King Charles\u2019s face.\u201cI kept it really organic because [Charles] seems to be somebody who\u2019s very interested in the environment\u2026 I wanted to try and capture a little bit of that as well.\u201d",
        "Ms Eason\u2019s love of sand drawing has been a \u201cpart of my life always\u201d and started when she was a child.Her desire to pursue sand drawing came after the invention of drones to help her visualise her drawings on a bigger scale.\u201cWhen my kids were growing up, we used to do some drawings, quite big ones [on the sand], but we never had a drone because they hadn\u2019t been invented, so we would go and stand on a pier or a seawall and look over and get a sense of how big the cartoon was that we\u2019ve made,\u201d Ms Eason explained.\u201cI got a drone with the idea of taking nice pictures of the area, but also just experimenting a little bit with sand drawings.\u201dInterest in Ms Eason\u2019s sand art has grown organically and has been appreciated by many with an Instagram following of more than 2,700, though she said she is \u201castonished\u201d by the number of people who are also interested in her hobby.",
        "\u201cI was astonished to find that [my art] resonated with people rather than just myself,\u201d she said.\u201cIt seemed to, in certain situations, resonate with other people as well and that has just been a joy to find that it\u2019s possible to share it in a group format.\u201d",
        "The 58-year-old said there are \u201cmany parallels\u201d between her previous job as a GP and her sand art, which is something she did not expect.\u201cIt\u2019s always about people and it\u2019s about listening to what they want, and trying to really drill down and offer them a personal service that is meaningful to them,\u201d she said.\u201cIt\u2019s been quite a revelation to find that I feel quite comfortable in this new life because of what I used to do.\u201d"
