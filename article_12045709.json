        "BERLIN, May 4 (Reuters) - BMW Chief Executive Oliver Zipse warned on Thursday that the company still saw the macroeconomic environment as \"highly volatile\", with political, technological and regulatory conditions growing further apart.",
        "\"Many experts assume that major economic areas are likely to drift further apart - both from a political and technological perspective, and also with regard to regulations,\" Zipse said.Pursuing ringfenced strategies in each region would allow the carmaker to compensate for weaknesses in one market through revenues from others, Zipse said, pointing to difficulties in the Chinese market being offset by stronger performance in the United States.
