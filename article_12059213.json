        "Ambulance workers in the South East will strike on Tuesday as Unite escalates its industrial action in a long-running dispute over pay.",
        "Unite\u2019s members employed at South Central Ambulance Service NHS Trust and South East Coast Ambulance Service NHS Trust will strike from 12pm until 10pm.Last month, Unite\u2019s members and those in the Royal College of Nursing employed in the NHS in England rejected the Government\u2019s offer of a lump sum cash payment for 2022/23 and a 5% pay rise for this year.",
        "Members of most other health unions accepted the offer.Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: \u201cThe Government must reopen negotiations to ensure that a proper wage offer is made to NHS workers.\u201cWe have always said that a non-consolidated lump sum for 22/23 would not cut it. So it has turned out.\u201cThe current offer does nothing to resolve the recruitment and retention crisis crippling the NHS.\u201cThe strike action by our South East ambulance workers is part of Unite\u2019s escalation strategy to exert greater pressure on the Government.\u201d"
