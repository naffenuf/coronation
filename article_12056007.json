        "Ben Ikin has left his role as the Brisbane Broncos' head of football operations after just under two years with the club.",
        "A premiership-winning halfback at the Broncos, Ikin left his job as a media pundit and re-joined the club in mid-2021 during the most dire period of form in its history.Under his stewardship, the Broncos recruited players including Kurt Capewell, Reece Walsh and Martin Taupau, while Selwyn Cobbo, Ezra Mam and Billy Walters all became regular first-graders.The Broncos finished 14th in Ikin's first season at the helm but now sit first through 10 rounds of the 2023 campaign.Ikin had initially applied for the club's vacant chief executive job but was instead hired to replace Peter Nolan as head of football.He then transitioned from head of football to head of football operations, focusing less on recruitment and retention than in his previous portfolio.\"I've thoroughly enjoyed my time at the Broncos and certainly learned a lot,\" Ikin said.\"I leave here knowing the football program is in better shape than when I arrived.\"There are a lot of good people at the Broncos doing great work, and I know that ultimate success for the club is getting much closer.\""
