        "CUTLETS OF WINDSOR LAMB WITH SAUCE PALOISE",
        "Serves 636 spears of English asparagus750g (1lb 10oz) Jersey Royal new potatoes30g (1oz) butter12 cutlets of lamb (French-trimmed)Sea salt and pepper100ml (3\u00bdfl oz) herb oil, such as rosemary or thymeFor the sauceA small bunch of mint350ml (12fl oz) white wine vinegar1tsp white peppercorns100g (3\u00bdoz) shallots, finely chopped250g (9oz) unsalted butter3 free-range egg yolksA squeeze of lemon juiceFor the sauce, pick the leaves from the mint and set aside. Chop the mint stalks, then combine with the vinegar, peppercorns and shallots in a pan. Bring to the boil over a high heat, then cook until the mixture has reduced by two-thirds.Blanch the mint leaves in boiling water for 10-15 seconds to soften, then quickly refresh under cold running water. Gently squeeze the leaves dry and finely chop with a sharp knife.Melt the butter in a pan, skimming off any white solids that rise to the surface. Keep warm.\u00a0In a heatproof bowl placed over a pan of simmering water, whisk together the egg yolks and the vinegar reduction until they form a pale yellow foam (sabayon) which should hold its shape when you lift the whisk. (You must ensure that the sabayon does not get too hot or the egg yolk will start to cook.)Slowly trickle the warm butter into the sabayon with a ladle, whisking all the time. The sauce should acquire a consistency similar to that of mayonnaise. Add a squeeze of lemon juice and the chopped blanched mint.Carefully peel and trim the asparagus, taking care to remove the woody stems at the base of the spears.",
        "Wash the Jersey Royals well and bring to the boil in a large pan of salted water. Turn down the heat until the pan is just simmering and allow to cook gently until tender. Once the potatoes are cooked, strain them and return to the heat briefly to dry off, before adding the butter.\u00a0Cover and keep somewhere warm for at least 10 minutes before serving: this is so the potatoes can really absorb the butter.Season the lamb cutlets with sea salt, freshly milled pepper and the herb oil before grilling in a hot griddle pan for 3-5 minutes per side (depending on how you like your lamb cooked).Allow the lamb to sit and rest somewhere warm for 5 minutes. In the meantime, cook the asparagus in boiling salted water for 4-5 minutes, depending on the thickness of the spears. Serve the lamb with the asparagus, Jersey Royals and a generous pot of warm sauce Paloise.Cook's tip:\u00a0The royal kitchens use spring lamb from the Windsor Estate and English asparagus \u2013 which is beyond compare.Olly's wine pairing: Luscious with lamb\u00a0Cabardes Terroirs d\u2019Altitude Chateau de Pennautier 2018 (14.5%) \u00a311.50, thewinesociety.comComplex, mature and delicious, this red has all the silky quality of higher-priced classics, plus a truffly richness that\u2019s bang on for lamb.",

Whisk the batter until smooth and place to one side.",
        "Whisk 2 egg whites with the remaining sugar until they form light peaks that support themselves; gently fold them through the batter, combining them fully.Once the oven has reached the correct temperature, carefully remove the flat baking tray. Pour the souffl\u00e9 mixture into the flan moulds (or blini pans).Return the tray to the oven and bake for 5-8 minutes, or until the souffl\u00e9 is golden brown in appearance.Whilst the cr\u00eapes souffl\u00e9 are baking, prepare the apricot sauce to accompany the dessert. Melt the 30g butter. In a separate saucepan, gently warm the apricot preserve, adding a little water if required to amend the consistency: it should be a thick enough syrup to coat the cr\u00eapes.Once the cr\u00eapes souffl\u00e9 are ready, work quickly to remove them from the oven and then from their moulds. Using a palette knife or plastic spatula, place the first cr\u00eape on to your serving dishes, then, with a cocktail stick, pierce a few holes in the cr\u00eape \u2013 this will allow the cr\u00eapes souffl\u00e9 to absorb the butter and apricot jam that you will spoon over.Repeat this process until 2 or 3 cr\u00eapes are placed on top of each other on each dish. Spoon the butter over and then the jam, allowing it to pour down the sides and on to the dishes.Cook's tip:\u00a0A small sprig of mint and a slice of tinned apricot adds the finishing touch to the top of the cr\u00eapes.Olly's wine pairing: Apricot Appetiser\u00a0Coolhurst Demi-Sec Ros\u00e9 2017 (12%) \u00a342, coolhurstvineyards.comA sensational Sussex bubbly that\u2019s off-dry and irresistibly fruity \u2013 think rhubarb dusted with icing sugar \u2013 this is especially delightful as a partner for the Apricot Cr\u00eapes Souffl\u00e9.CHOCOLATE BISCUIT CAKE",
