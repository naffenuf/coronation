        "An official report into the resignation of a Roman Catholic bishop who ignored warnings to stop associating with a paedophile has been met with \u201cutter dismay\u201d by abuse survivors.",
        "Bishop Robert Byrne stepped down from the Diocese of Hexham and Newcastle in December, stating his role had \u201cbecome too great a burden to bear\u201d.An official investigation by Archbishop Malcolm McMahon was ordered and it has found Bishop Byrne, 66, made a series of \u201cerrors of judgment\u201d.They included his continued association with friar Father Timothy Gardner, a frequent visitor to his house, despite warnings from senior priests that Gardner was a convicted paedophile.Bishop Byrne also appointed Canon Michael McCoy to be dean of the cathedral despite safeguarding issues about his contact with older teens.Canon McCoy killed himself in 2021, days after police told him they were investigating an allegation of historic sex abuse.",
        "Archbishop McMahon\u2019s report also called Canon McCoy\u2019s appointment an error of judgment. For the Archbishop of Liverpool to refer to Bishop Bryne's association with a paedophile, and the promotion of another priest around whom there were safeguarding concerns simply as 'errors of judgment' beggars belief  Catholic Survivors  But the inquiry found media reports of lockdown sex parties in the cathedral quarters, said to have been hosted by Canon McCoy, were \u201csimply untrue\u201d.It also found that when the bishop moved from an historic home in Newcastle\u2019s West End to the leafy suburb of Gosforth, which was criticised by some in the diocese, he could have moved somewhere cheaper and less \u201cconspicuous\u201d.",
        "Catholic Survivors, an informal network formed by survivors of Church-related abuse, said its response to the report was \u201cone of utter dismay\u201d.They said: \u201cFor the Archbishop of Liverpool to refer to Bishop Bryne\u2019s association with a paedophile, and the promotion of another priest around whom there were safeguarding concerns simply as \u2018errors of judgment\u2019 beggars belief.\u201cIt suggests that those in leadership in the Church still do not grasp the seriousness of the Church\u2019s persistent failure to deal effectively with its safeguarding failures and no lessons have been learnt.\u201d The weasel words in this report prove the need for external oversight of church safeguarding; the Catholic Church clearly cannot police itself  Lawyer Richard Scorer  Richard Scorer, a lawyer specialising in supporting abuse victims, said the investigation was \u201ccompletely inadequate\u201d.The head of abuse law at Slater Gordon said: \u201cThe weasel words in this report prove the need for external oversight of church safeguarding; the Catholic Church clearly cannot police itself.\u201dRegarding the allegations of \u201clewd parties\u201d during lockdown, the report stated that the police were informed after volunteers who had sanitised the cathedral were invited into the cathedral house for \u201crefreshments\u201d, in breach of regulations at the time.It added: \u201cOn occasion, after long days, the volunteers were offered a take-away meal and a glass of wine.",
        "\u201cAt the time, Covid regulations were in force and a report was made to Northumbria Police but no action was taken.\u201d It was an error of judgment to promote a priest with a safeguarding record to a high-profile position  Archbishop Malcolm McMahon report  Bishop Byrne was not present at any of these gatherings, the report said.Regarding Canon McCoy\u2019s \u201csad death by suicide\u201d, the report said he had twice been the subject of \u201csafeguarding plans regarding boundaries relevant to working with older teenagers\u201d.The report said Bishop Byrne had been informed by \u201cmore than one source\u201d of safeguarding issues surrounding Canon McCoy before he was appointed to work at the cathedral.\u201cIt was an error of judgment to then promote a priest with a safeguarding record to a high-profile position,\u201d the report added.\u201cInstead, Bishop Byrne could have paid greater heed to ensuring that Michael McCoy was appropriately managed, given the safeguarding concerns which had been raised.\u201d Bishop Byrne failed to understand the risks he was taking both for himself and the diocese  Archbishop Malcolm McMahon report  There was a \u201cfurther error of judgment\u201d in associating with Father Gardner, a convicted paedophile the bishop had known for many years, the report found.\u201cThey were seen associating together in public in Newcastle and it was known that Gardner was a frequent visitor at Bishop\u2019s House,\u201d the report\u2019s executive summary, published on the diocese website, said.",
        "\u201cDespite being advised by senior priests in the diocese that this was an inappropriate relationship, Bishop Byrne insisted that it was a pastoral relationship and therefore appropriate and refused their advice.\u201cBishop Byrne failed to understand the risks he was taking both for himself and the diocese.\u201dArchbishop McMahon concluded: \u201cI emphasise that it was a succession of errors of judgment by Bishop Byrne that exacerbated the key issues above.\u201cIn my view, he himself was unable to see a path forward, and his failure to see his part in these situations made clear his inability to cope with the demands of his role.\u201d"
