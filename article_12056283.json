They confirmed the death is not being treated as suspicious.On a special tribute episode of The Project on Australian TV station Channel 10, Marco Pierre White praised his former apprentice chef.",
        "\u201cJock came to me when he was 17 years old, his enthusiasm was greater than his knowledge, but it was that enthusiasm which drove him, maybe fuelled by his fears of failure, by his insecurities, which I could relate to.\u201cVery few chefs have an inquisitive mind, an intellectual mind and a creative mind.\u201cThat\u2019s what makes him special, that\u2019s what makes him rare.\u201dPierre White said what he did for the industry in Australia was \u201cextraordinary\u201d.\u201cHe was filled with empathy, with compassion, he had qualities very few chefs have,\u201d he said.\u201cHe\u2019ll be greatly missed \u2026 he was a star in the true sense and that\u2019s why he has my vote to be one of the great cooks of the 21st century, he was special, he was rare.\u201dRamsay was brought to tears when he spoke about Zonfrillo, who he had worked with back in the 1990s in London.",
        "\u201cThe ripples have been devastating, no-one is going to get over this quickly,\u201d Ramsay said.\u201cIf there is one thing we\u2019ve done as chefs is we\u2019ve united and have been talking about the good times, it\u2019s just so painful.\u201cIt\u2019s just a shock, a massive shock. He was never done as a chef, he still had years to go.\u201dRamsay said spending time with him on Masterchef was \u201celectrifying\u201d.\u201cBeing in the environment together sort of took us back 20 years, there is something quite amazing about two Scots coming together in Australia, it makes you happy at the end of the day,\u201d he added.\u201cThere was always something quite of encouraging about the shit we\u2019d gone through to get to where we\u2019d been.\u201dJamie Oliver said he remembers meeting Jock for the first time when he was 22 when he took his then girlfriend and now wife Jules to his restaurant.\u201cIt was me and Jules\u2019 first date weekend and we went there, and there he was, young Jock, 22 years old, head chef with a beautiful menu and beautiful food,\u201d he said.\u201cI remember it because it was the first time I remember being spoiled by another chef.\u201cHe came from really humble beginnings and he smashed it, just smashed it \u2026 we\u2019ve lost a very, very bright star.\u201d",
        "Nigella Lawson said her heart breaks for Zonfrillo\u2019s family.\u201cMy heart breaks \u2013 as I am sure everyone\u2019s does \u2013 for Jock\u2019s children and his family, and everyone who loved him,\u201d Lawson said.\u201cThere\u2019s an old-fashioned phrase here but may his memory be a blessing.\u201d"
