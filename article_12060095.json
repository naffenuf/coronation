        "In July 2019, Vallow took a trip with her niece Melanie Boudreaux and her two children who Daybell referred to '3s' in the texts. Her son JJ was also on the trip, but it is not known if Tylee was there.\u00a0The '3s' refers to the couple's twisted rating system for 'dark' people they believed were possessed.Daybell had sent a text to Vallow asking if she wanted him to 'cause pain' to the two 3s she was riding with.Vallow told Daybell to hold off, but added if they started acting up again, 'we can zap them.' Daybell agreed and said: 'If they are going to act up, we'll at least give them a reason to scream.'",
        "Hart told the Ada County Courthouse in Boise that the 'references to hurting children and giving them a reason to scream are relevant.' He confirmed that he never saw any messages that depicted Vallow protesting the harm of anyone.\u00a0Hart, who took the stand last week, has told jurors that messages between the pair show that they were plotting the killings of\u00a0her then-husband Charles Vallow, her kids, and Daybell's wife.\u00a0Vallow is facing a separate trial over the killing of her estranged husband Charles who was shot dead by her brother in Arizona in July, 2019.On July 29, Daybell texted Vallow while she was on the trip with Boudreaux.\u00a0'One question: Do you want me to cause pain yet to those two 3s you're riding with?'\u00a0Vallow responded: 'Probably hold off on then till we arrive. This will be mistake to deal with.\u00a0But I'll text you if they start acting up and we can zap them. Miserable not mistake.'\u00a0Daybell replied: 'Sounds great. Yes if they are going to act up, we'll at least give them a reason to scream. I love, cherish, treasure and adore you. The wonderful memories just keep coming back. you are mesmerizing. Raphael is one lucky guy.'\u00a0Hart said that JJ was present in the car, but said he was not sure if Tylee was there.\u00a0",
        "Just a few days prior to the trip, Vallow had sent a text to Daybell talking about 'weird stuff happening in the middle of the night' and that Tylee had been acting weird.\u00a0",
        "On July 23, 2019, Vallow texted: 'Good morning. Missing you. Didn't sleep much. Need you to check jj. Weird stuff happened in the middle of the night. It's like they distracted us with Blake.'She added: 'When you get home, Check Tylee. She is being super sweet and helpful and she cleaned her room. See if she got switched. Totally not her.'Daybell responded: 'Yes. she was switched. Please let me know when you can talk, and I will explain it.'On July 26, Vallow sent a text asking Daybell to check on JJ.'She said he was calm and he watched movies all day which he would never do.'Daybell responded to her: 'It is still JJ. I'm told she is lying about him being calm and watching movies.'Vallow responded: 'Mel knew. She called me. She felt the real Brighton last night and knew she was different. She was told I didn't want to tell her. She is taking it well and knows it is part of a big plan. She is amazing! Although I'm still pretty upset about it, I love you. Missing your kisses.'",
        "Brighton is one of Boudreaux's child.There are also texts that revealed how the pair created a twisted percentage scale to show how close her kids were to death.Hart said that the closer the number is to 100 or zero, the closer they are to death. According to the scale, both children were very close.In texts sent between July and August, JJ was at 99.99. Tylee was at 0.13.One of the texts refers to causing Tylee pain.",
        "On July 18, Daybell texted Vallow: 'I have been instructed to focus my efforts on Hillary, so I will.'Hillary is the name they call the spirit they claim possessed Tylee.\u00a0Vallow responded to Daybell: 'Ok. Find out her percentage for me and JJ.'Daybell to Vallow: 'She is at a 0.13. I turned up the pain to 10 and placed a spiritual virus in her. He is at 99.99. Raphael visited him and told him to follow Amy into the light. I also assured him that James would love and take care of his mommy, which he will with all of his heart and soul.'Vallow to Daybell: 'That is sweet! I miss you desperately.'On July 30, Daybell texted Vallow to let her know the death percentages had changed.",
        "'I got the inspiration to go back to my original death percentages that helped us track Charles, Ned, etc. Tammy is very close. Her percentage has fallen steadily since Hiplos left. It is encouraging!'Vallow responded with two questions: 'What s the percentage now? what about jjs too?'\u00a0Daybell replied to her that, 'Tammy is at 3. JJ is at 2.' 'Both are being heavily shielded to stop intruders,' he added.\u00a0Vallow asked:\u00a0'2 and 3 percent? Not zero?' Daybell said he would explain later and she responded: 'Ok. Still feeling hot for you.'\u00a0'Yes, we might need to release a little steam next time we meet,' Daybell said in a cringy text.\u00a0He continued: 'Anyway, this is the chart that checks what percentage mortals are still in their body. It worked for my friend's wife who died, my neighbor, George Bush, Stan Lee, etc. I kind of forgot about it because we've been dealing with zombies and demonic entities. But this afternoon Tammy said she felt lightheaded, as if her body and spirit weren't connected.'\u00a0By August 10, a text exchange referred to 'orchestrated plan to take the children,' Hart said.\u00a0'You are doing everything right my love,' Daybell texted Vallow when she asked if there was anything she could do to help. He added the Lord told him that they are 'right on track.'",
        "Daybell also said in a text that he could\u00a0sense JJ 'was barely attached to his body.'",
        "Last week, it was revealed that Vallow, 49, and Daybell, 54, also engaged in toe-curling sexting sessions about showering together and 'naked activities' during their affair which started shortly after they met at a doomsday conference in late 2018.\u00a0The State says Vallow wanted 'money, power, sex' and that she also used 'those things to get what she wanted.' Vallow, who faces life in prison if convicted, denies the charges against her.
