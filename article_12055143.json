        "The former actress, 41, held a 'low key' celebration for Prince Archie, 4, instead of celebrating the crowning of her father-in-law as King Charles III.Prince Harry, 38, managed a whistle-stop visit for the coronation - leaving at 1.15pm to rejoin his family at their \u00a311 million mansion in Montecito, California.And Meghan's father says this was a good thing - because of the bad blood amid the family feud.The 78-year-old, who stayed up all night to watch the ceremony on TV at his home in Rosarito, Mexico, told the Mail on Sunday he believed \u2018it was for the best\u2019 that the Duchess stayed at home.",
        "He continued:\u00a0\u2018There are too many disagreements between Meghan, Harry and the Royals.'It was wonderful to watch the good people of Britain welcome their new King and Queen.'Prince Harry slipped out of Westminster Abbey\u00a0- accompanied by a Metropolitan police escort and four outriders - with only the briefest of goodbyes and headed straight for Heathrow Airport.He rushed from the service to the airport in a blacked-out BMW\u00a0accompanied by a Metropolitan police escort and four outriders, where he was taken to the VIP Windsor Suite.After just 28 hours and 42 minutes in the UK, he was back on the plane to California before his father and stepmother had even finished having their official portraits taken.",
        "And it appears Meghan too was keen to avoid the 'drama' of returning to the UK.A source close to the Sussexes told the Mail on Sunday that Meghan \u2018stayed home to celebrate Archie\u2019s birthday because she felt it would be inauthentic to do anything else\u2019.\u00a0",
        "They added: \u2018She wanted to minimise the drama.\u2019\u00a0Harry was pictured smiling broadly as he arrived at the airport\u2019s Windsor suite before his British Airways flight still in morning suit and sporting his medals.The Duke of Sussex is believed to have boarded a 3.45pm flight which would have seen him land in Los Angeles at 6.55pm local time.The drive to Montecito from Los Angeles airport takes about 90 minutes. Another source said: \u2018He was always determined to get back in time to spend part of Archie\u2019s birthday at home.'Harry was determined to be back in time to tuck Archie into bed.\u2019They confirmed Archie had a \u2018private celebration\u2019 on his birthday and a lemon cake baked by the Duchess of Sussex using fruit from their garden.\u00a0When asked if any of the party guests included celebrity neighbours such as Oprah Winfrey, the source replied: \u2018Some of their friends are celebrities, so yes, that\u2019s likely. It will be a small, intimate gathering.\u2019\u00a0Archie\u2019s grandmother Doria Ragland was expected to be at the party, as well as Meghan\u2019s close friend, make-up mogul Victoria Jackson, 65.\u00a0",
        "It was reported that the Duke had been invited to a post-coronation lunch at Buckingham Palace, in what many would have seen as an olive branch after his explosive memoir Spare left several members of the Royal Family reeling - most notably his brother Prince William.Harry had worn an awkward smile today as he was forced to watch the event of a generation from his relegated seat in the third row - while his sibling took centre stage alongside a radiant Kate Middleton.The Duke seemed keen to put on a jovial display amid ongoing speculation of the Royal Family's inner turmoil following the release of his bombshell book in February.Wearing medals pinned to his suit jacket, he had been seen laughing and smiling as he entered the church alongside Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice and their respective husbands Jack Brooksbank and Edo Mapelli Mozzi.\u00a0It came after he awkwardly nodded at other guests as he endured a solo walk down the aisle to take his seat next to his cousins ahead of the arrival of his father and now Queen Camilla.Harry appeared to bow his head as the newly-anointed King walked past him on his way out of the abbey - although much of his true reaction was blocked by a feather on Princess Anne's hat.",
        "The prince had not been seen for over 24 hours after his arrival and accommodation plans remained shrouded in secrecy - before it emerged he had flown into the UK on a commercial American Airlines flight on Friday morning."
