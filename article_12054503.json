        "Defensive lineman Jordon Riley signed his rookie contract with the New York Giants, the team announced Saturday during the second and final day of its rookie camp in East Rutherford, N.J.",
        "Riley was a seventh-round pick last weekend in the NFL draft.After stints at North Carolina, Garden City Community College and Nebraska, Riley landed at Oregon in 2022. He played 13 games that season for the Ducks, finishing with 21 tackles (seven solo), 1.5 tackles for loss, a half-sack and one pass defensed.\"Jordon Riley, again, big body guy. It's hard to find these guys,\" Giants general manager Joe Schoen said.\"You walk out to practice and there's this 6-5, 330-pound guy, who piques your interest right there. Again, some of these guys in different schemes may not have the production, the tackles, the sacks. But for what (coach) Wink (Martindale) looks for in terms of size, length, knock back, he possesses those traits.\"Riley is the fourth rookie from this year's draft class to commit to a contract. Running back Eric Gray, defensive back Gervarrius Owens and cornerback Tre Hawkins III signed their rookie contracts Friday.--Field Level Media"
