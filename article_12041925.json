It should weaken to 4.667 within three months, the poll found.",
        "The Hungarian forint, which has gained over 6% in 2023, is set to lose almost 1% to around 378.5 to the euro in a year's time - a level the forint fell below in May last year and only returned to in early 2023.Hungary's central bank lowered the top of its interest rate corridor, paving the way for eventual cuts.Also in the poll, the Czech crown was forecast to be little changed, with a median forecast putting it at 23.60 to the euro in a year. Romania's leu was expected to fall 2.3% to 5.055 to the euro.(For other stories from the May Reuters foreign exchange poll:)(Reporting by Jason Hovet; additional polling by Sarupya Ganguly and Sujith Pai; editing by Barbara Lewis)"
