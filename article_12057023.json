        "Eugenie, who is expecting her second child this summer with husband Jack Brooksbank, joined sister Princess Beatrice on Chalfont St Giles\u2019 village green in Buckinghamshire for the social gathering.",
        "As temperatures reached over 20C, the pair \u201clost\u201d each other while crowds of \u201cdisbelieving\u201d fans piled in to take selfies with them.At one point as Eugenie made her way through the green, she said: \u201cI\u2019m still waiting for my sister \u2013 I feel a bit weird without her.\u201dWhen asked how she felt, she joked: \u201cA bit pregnant \u2013 I can get people out of the way with my bump.\u201d",
        "Paul Buchanan, president of the village show, described the atmosphere as \u201cfanatical\u201d.\u201cThere was just disbelief,\u201d he added. \u201cEveryone went to see them. They got such a huge buzz.\u201dReferring to Eugenie\u2019s pregnancy, he said: \u201cFair play \u2013 we got seats ready for her but she didn\u2019t ask for one\u201d.",
        "The event \u2013 one of many across the country \u2013 saw thousands of people turn out in the summer sun to celebrate the King\u2019s coronation.Locals gathered on the quaint green, decorated with large cardboard crowns and bunting, where they shared food, listened to music and had a \u201cbest-dressed table\u201d competition.The royal sisters, who 24 hours earlier were watching their uncle and his wife being crowned, were warmly embraced by dozens of fans at the party as live music blared from a stage.",
        "One lady embraced Eugenie, rubbing her back affectionately and saying: \u201cYou look amazing \u2013 what a beautiful young woman.\u201dBeatrice, who was diagnosed with dyslexia when a young girl and is now patron of the Helen Arkell Dyslexia Charity, stopped to meet nine-year-old dyslexic Mia,\u00a0and praised the coronation hat she had made at school before those around her broke into applause.",
        "Proud mother Nova Humphrys said afterwards: \u201cMy daughter is dyslexic and Beatrice told her she could still do great things.\u201dThe princesses also stopped to thank volunteers from All Together Community, which provided food for those in need during the lockdown.They then watched a performance by the local dance troupe before leaving with their entourage as revellers clapped.Speaking afterwards, Stephen Hinds, chairman of the event, said village residents would \u201cremember this for the rest of their lives \u2013 probably centuries\u201d."
