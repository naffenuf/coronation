        "'I'm glad she's [Markle] not going.\u00a0Who wants to sit and look at her try to pretend like she's there in any way supportive of the royal family? She hates them, despite the fact that they made her a megastar,' Kelly, 52, said.\u00a0Earlier this year, it emerged that Markle, 41, would not be attending her father-in-law's coronation as king and will remain at home in California with her and Prince Harry's children, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet.\u00a0'They gave her all this opportunity to earn millions and millions of dollars ... And gave her a royal wedding and Diana's jewels and the Queen's and all of it.\u00a0She hates them, so why would we have to look at her sitting there pretending otherwise? It was annoying enough at the Queen's funeral,' the former Fox News and NBC host said.\u00a0Markle attended Queen Elizabeth II's funeral in London in September 2022 alongside her family.\u00a0",

But there is speculation he will have no formal role in the service and may even be sat several rows back from his brother William and other working royals.\u00a0\u00a0Asked in an interview in January whether he would attend the Coronation if invited, Harry said \u2018the door is always open.'Earlier this year, Kelly brought up Meghan and Harry after the pair were mocked on an episode of South Park.\u00a0",
        "The host said that being mocked on the long-running Comedy Central cartoon is a sign that it's over for them.'I feel this is a pronouncement that they have jumped the shark, they are not beloved and her hopes of running for president, reported hopes, are all but dashed,' Kelly said.Markle\u00a0has become more involved in politics of late, with whispers of presidential ambitions being heard as recently as last summer. Her biographer went as far as to call a White House bid 'likely'.",
        "'That's not happening,' Kelly added.
