        "Emergency crews had rushed the girl to the city's Timone hospital and tried to resuscitate her but to no avail.Similarly, in 2019, a\u00a013-year-old girl in Amsterdam was electrocuted when her smartphone fell into the bath while it was charging.",
        "The teenager's mother dragged her out of the bathtub after racing to the bathroom when she heard a loud scream. She had called the emergency services.Paramedics woke up the unconscious girl by punching her in the sternum, before whisking her straight off to hospital, where she spent two days.In this instance, the girl didn't die but was left with amnesia as a result of the incident, and couldn't recall the moment she dropped the phone in the bath.Dr Sem Hardon said the severity of her injuries made it likely she was electrocuted by the mains supply, which is 240V in the Netherlands.He added: 'If household electrical devices are used in bathrooms, users must be aware of safety hazards\u2026'Nonetheless, electrical appliances or cords should never be plugged in near water and should never be in contact with a wet environment.'"
