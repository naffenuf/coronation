        "A man was hijacked at gunpoint by a masked gang and then forced to drive his car with a suspicious object on board to a police station in Northern Ireland.",
        "The incident caused a major security alert in Omagh, Co Tyrone, which led to a number of people being evacuated from their homes and cordons erected.While the alert has now ended, examinations are ongoing to establish if the suspicious device is viable.The victim was hijacked by three masked men in the Fireagh Road area, off the Dromore Road in Omagh, at around 10pm on Saturday. The misguided and senseless actions of those responsible have caused disruption in the local community  Inspector Will Brown  The masked men placed a suspicious object in his vehicle \u2013 a silver-coloured Volkswagen Golf \u2013 and forced him to travel to the Derry Road area and abandon the car outside Omagh police station.Ammunition technical officers examined the object which has now been removed from the scene.PSNI Inspector Will Brown said the driver had been left badly shaken by the ordeal.He said: \u201cThe misguided and senseless actions of those responsible have caused disruption in the local community.\u201cOur thoughts are with the driver, who was, understandably, badly shaken by the ordeal.\u201dHe added: \u201cThank you to all those who were impacted and to the wider public for your patience and co-operation.\u201cWe are also grateful for the understanding of those impacted by the ongoing police activity in the Fireagh Road area.",
        "\u201cWe are particularly keen to speak to anyone who was in the vicinity of the church on the Fireagh Road, or travelling between the Fieragh Road and Omagh police station between\u00a09pm and\u00a010pm\u00a0last night.\u201cIf you saw anything suspicious, or you have dash cam which may assist with our investigation, please get in touch by calling 101, quoting serial\u00a02015\u00a0of 6/5/23.\u201dAlliance Party councillor Stephen Donnelly said the incident took place close to his home.He said: \u201cThe thugs behind this incident are a danger to our community and must be urgently apprehended by the authorities, so I would urge anybody with any information to contact the police.\u201cOmagh refuses to bow to those who would have our lives ruled by fear.\u201cWe never have and we never will.\u201d",
        "DUP MLA Thomas Buchanan said: \u201cMy thoughts are with everyone involved but the motorist will never forget this for the rest of their days.\u201cIt\u2019s a throwback to the days when the IRA used to force people to become human bombs when targeting police and Army.\u201cIt was wrong then and it\u2019s wrong today.\u201dDissident republicans, in particular the New IRA, are believed to have been responsible for a number of attacks and attempted attacks on police in recent months.In February, Detective Chief Inspector John Caldwell was shot several times in an attempted murder bid which the police have blamed on the New IRA.",
        "Detectives also said they believed the group intended to use a number of viable pipe bombs, which were discovered in a Londonderry cemetery following a republican Easter commemoration parade, to attack the police.In November of last year a police patrol vehicle sustained damage after being targeted by an explosive device in Strabane, Co Tyrone.MI5 recently raised the terrorism\u00a0threat\u00a0level\u00a0in\u00a0Northern\u00a0Ireland\u00a0to severe, meaning an attack is highly likely, in response to an upsurge in dissident activity.In 1998 the Real IRA detonated a car bomb in Omagh, killing 29 people, including a woman pregnant with twins, the worst single atrocity of the Northern Ireland Troubles."
