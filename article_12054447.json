        "Le\u00e3o limped off in the 11th minute of a 2-0 win against Lazio in Serie A, shortly after pulling up and clutching the top of his right thigh.\"If Rafa\u00b4s good then that\u00b4s better obviously, otherwise we can also do well without him,\" Pioli said. \"But he seemed calm to me, he was fine, I don\u00b4t think it\u00b4s serious but we\u00b4ll evaluate it tomorrow.\"He stopped in time, he was very calm and that gives me good hope.\"Le\u00e3o is a key player for the Rossoneri and has 12 league goals this season.Milan hosts city rival Inter in the first leg of the Champions League semifinals on Wednesday. The return leg is the following Tuesday.",
