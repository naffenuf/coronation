        "Carlos Alcaraz remains on course to defend his Madrid Open title after he powered past a determined Karen Khachanov to reach the last four.",
        "The top seed eventually prevailed 6-4 7-5 but only after he staged an impressive fight back in the second set to book a third ATP Masters 1000 semi-final of the season.Alcaraz\u2019s clay-court winning streak now stands at nine and he has tasted victory in 19 of his past 20 matches, claiming title triumphs in Indian Wells and Barcelona along the way.A hard-fought opener went the way of the Spaniard, who celebrates his 20th birthday on Friday, but the second set did not initially go to plan.Khachanov built up a 5-2 lead and looked set to force a decider only for Alcaraz to find his A-game with a string of winners and drop shots to eventually earn victory in one hour and 51 minutes.\u201cIt was pretty tough. The first set as well, it was close,\u201d said Alcaraz.",
        "\u201cI was in trouble in the second set, a break down and [he had] two break points to have the second break. So, it was really tough for me to come back and he had his chances to win the second set.\u201cLuckily I knew I was going to have my chances. I just tried to take my opportunities and I\u2019m really happy to get through.\u201d Luckily I knew I was going to have my chances. I just tried to take my opportunities and I\u2019m really happy to get through.  Carlos Alcaraz  ",

I\u2019m just very happy to be in the semi-finals.\u201dAfter first-round exits at the Miami Open, Monte-Carlo Masters and Madrid Open, Murray was able to return to winning ways with a 6-3 6-3 win over wild-card Monfils.Murray will face another Frenchmen in Laurent Lokoli in the last-16 and aim to build momentum before this month\u2019s French Open at Roland Garros."
