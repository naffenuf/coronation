The plan is for Matty to walk out on stage mid-show and play two songs.'They will chat to the audience and, at present, the idea is for them to confirm their romance with some kind of PDA \u2014 public display of affection. It won't be anything remotely cheesy though.'Healy did not join Swift on stage during Friday night's concert.",
        "MailOnline contacted representatives of Swift and Healy for comment at the time.It comes as the British hunk reportedly split from model Meredith Mickelson just weeks before he started dating the Mean hitmaker.The singer was said to have been romancing the model, 23, who has built up a large following on social media, before they parted ways in Febuary.A source told The Sun: 'Matty was seeing Meredith while he was in LA in February - but things fizzled out when he went to New York at the end of the month,' says an insider.'They're still on good terms but haven't been romantically involved since then.'Meredith boasts over 3million followers on Instagram and is said to be based primarily between Los Angeles and Paris.",
        "MailOnline has contacted representatives of Meredith Mickelson for comment.It comes after Matty and Taylor's reported new romance was revealed on Wednesday- just weeks after her split from actor Joe Alwyn.",
        "The singer is said to be 'madly in love' with Matty after their long-term friendship blossomed into romance.News of the new romance comes just weeks after it emerged that Taylor split from her boyfriend of six years Joe, 32, after the pair 'struggled' with their 'career differences'.Yet despite the short turnaround, Taylor is said to be 'madly in love' with Matt - who is the son of Loose Women star Denise Welch and Benidorm actor, Tim Healy.The rumoured romance with Matt is the latest in a string of British boyfriends for Taylor, who - as well as her last relationship with Joe - has dated Harry Styles, Calvin Harris, and Tom Hiddleston.An insider told the publication: 'She and Matty are madly in love.''It's super-early days, but it feels right. They first dated, very briefly, almost ten years ago but timings just didn't work out.'The source went on to insist that there was no crossover in Taylor's love life, despite news of her split from Joe emerging last month, insisting that the pair actually broke up in February.",
        "Taylor is currently in the middle of the US leg of her The Eras Tour while The 1975 are on their At Their Very Best concert tour, but the source insisted they have kept in constant communication by texting and Face Timing.The source added: 'As two international megastars, they understand the pressures of one another's jobs better than anyone, and are incredibly supportive of their respective careers.'They are both massively proud and excited about this relationship and, unlike Taylor's last one \u2014 which was very much kept out of the spotlight, deliberately \u2014 she wants to 'own' this romance, and not hide it away.",
        "'Taylor just wants to live her life, and be happy. She's told pals Matty is flying to Nashville over the weekend to support her on the next leg of her tour.'DailyMail.com contacted representatives for Taylor for comment.Back in 2015, Matt denied romance rumours with Taylor but confirmed they had been texting each other frequently.After rumours began circling he confirmed on Australian radio: 'It's fake. It's all bloody fake. It's a farce!'Yeah, we met each other, we exchanged numbers in the same way that a lot of people in this kind of world do and we spoke occasionally.'And she's the biggest pop star in the world and I'm in Australia. There's no like, relationship or anything happening. It's just funny how people really, really buy into that.'",
        "Matty Healy is the lead singer of British band The 1975, who, as well as having battled heroin addiction, was expelled from school for fighting, smokes fat joints in interviews and is generally better known for sex and drugs than rock and roll.Healy has a unique take on being famous, having grown up the child of famous \u2014 now divorced \u2014 parents.His father Tim Healy is best known for his role in Auf Wiedersehen, Pet and his mother Denise Welch was famous when he was growing up for her role in Soldier Soldier.She even had a (brief) singing career, releasing a single which nearly made the top 20. In 1997, she was cast in Coronation Street and the family moved from Northumberland to Manchester.By this point, Welch was suffering from depression, and medicating with alcohol and drugs, although she has been clean for some time.Healy met his The 1975 bandmates - Adam Hann, Ross MacDonald, and George Daniel -\u00a0at Wilmslow High School in Cheshire, where they were all 'misfits'.",
        "They used to rehearse at Healy's house \u2014 which was teeming with famous people, including Ringo Starr, Mark Knopfler, Rick Wakeman and AC/DC's Brian Johnson (who happens to be his godfather).He told an interviewer: 'I'd be playing on a guitar in the house, not knowing it was the one from [Dire Straits'] Romeo And Juliet.'One night, after hearing him play, prog rock legend Rick Wakeman pulled him to one side and told him he had 'it'.His father Tim told him once: 'Music is in your bones. You're the reincarnation of John Lennon. It's in you.'Despite the backing of his parents, the band struggled to get signed by a label.Healy even toyed with an acting career, making a cameo in the BBC school drama Waterloo Road, in which his mother also starred.The band released four EPs before releasing their debut self-titled album The 1975 in 2013, which topped the UK Albums Chart.Following this success, they released four subsequent albums, have won four Brit awards and played Glastonbury three times.He missed his mother's wedding to artist Lincoln Townley in 2013 because the band were supporting the Rolling Stones on tour.",
        "By the time he was 25, he was talking about having had a small heroin habit and a larger cocaine one before he was famous, and claimed that they have been overcome.But in the summer of 2017, the rest of the band staged an intervention, and told him to go to rehab for booze, heroin and opiate use.He flew to Barbados and spent eight weeks in rehab, which included equine therapy.He said of his horse mentor: 'I wanted to impress it more than any human being I've ever met. There were so many qualities I envied in this horse. And he had great hair.'More recently, he has been living in West London and having a much quieter life. He has tried yoga, and swimming, and has been trying to get on top of the frequent migraines he suffers.But, having fallen for the world's most visible female pop star, that has all changed in the blink of an eye. The question is, to quote one of Taylor's songs, are they Ready For It? Or will it be a swift ending?",
        "Taylor Swift fans were left in shock when it was revealed in April that she'd called it quits with Joe Alwyn after six years together.And with the hitmaker, 33, seemingly moving on with The 1975 frontman Matty Healy, DailyMail.com is taking a look back at her extensive dating history.July- October 2008: JOE JONAS",
        "Taylor dated Joe in the early days of her singing career back in 2008, but sadly split after only a few months together.The singer revealed that she was dumped over 'phone call' and their relationship was inspiration for the star's much-loved album Fearless.The Grammy-winning songstress then went onto slam Joe during an appearance on The Ellen Show, saying: 'There's one (song) that's about that guy, but that guy's not in my life anymore, unfortunately. That's ouch.'We haven't talked since, but you know what, some day I'm gonna find someone really really great who's right for me.''When I look at that person, I'm not even going to remember the boy who broke up with me over the phone in 25 seconds when I was 18.'But in 2015, Joe revealed he harbored no bad blood with Taylor during an interview with Access Hollywood, admitting that having a song written about you goes with the territory of dating a musician.",
        "And in 2021, Taylor hinted that she and Jonas were back on civil terms during another appearance on Ellen's Burning Questions segment.The star was asked what the most rebellious thing she did as a teenager was, which caused Taylor to laugh.'Probably when I like put Joe Jonas on blast on your show,' she began. 'That was too much, that was too much.'Meanwhile in 2021, Taylor put out previously unreleased track Mr. Perfectly Fine which is believed to be about ex Joe.August - November 2009: TAYLOR LAUTNER\u00a0",
        "Taylor and Taylor dated back in 2009, having first met while filming the upcoming ensemble romantic comedy Valentine's Day, where they shared an on-screen kiss.She described the moment as 'life-changing', and he appeared equally smitten, saying he definitely considered her 'his type'.When quizzed about their relationship on a U.S. radio show at the time, the Love Story singer played it coy.She said: 'I don't know, he's an amazing guy and we're really close... and ah... yep.'However it was a mere two months before their relationship was over.'He liked her more than she liked him. He went everywhere he could to see her, but she didn't travel much to see him,' a source told Us Weekly at the time. 'They decided they were better as friends.'It has long been rumored that Swift wrote Back To December about her 2009 relationship with Lautner.November 2009 - February 2010: JOHN MAYER\u00a0",
        "John Mayer reportedly dated Taylor from December 2009 through February 2010 when he was 31 and she was 19.They originally met when she collaborated on his song Half of My Heart.The romance seemingly ended on bad terms based on her scathing song Dear John which many people believe is about him.The name of the song as well as lyrics recalling her age (19) at the time of the romance appear to lead to the conclusion that is is fact about John and their rocky but brief romance, although the songstress never confirmed it was about him.The timing of the song also confirms its about John: She released the song in October 2010 on her Speak Now album, eight months after their reported split.",
        "The tune gave insight on how Taylor and John's reported romance went wrong, with the singer singing in tune: 'Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone/ Don't you think I was too young to be messed with / The girl in the dress cried the whole way home.'She also wrote the lyrics: 'Well maybe it's me / And my blind optimism to blame / Or maybe it's you and your sick need / To give love and take it away.'Dear John, I see it all now, it was wrong / Don't you think nineteen's too young / To be played by your dark, twisted games.'He added more fuel to the fire two years after the songs release when he told Rolling Stone magazine that he felt 'really humiliated' about the song, which 'made' him 'feel terrible.'October - December 2010: JAKE GYLLENHAAL\u00a0",
        "Swift and Gyllenhaal made headlines when they dated for just three months in the fall of 2010, when he was 29 and she was 20.Sources told tabloids at the time that it was 'serious,' and they were even spotted together over Thanksgiving weekend.Nearly two years after they split, Swift released Red, which included track number five, All Too Well, with allusions to the actor.In the original lyrics, Swift sings about taking a trip upstate with her romantic partner, leaving her scarf at his sister's house, dancing in the kitchen, and falling in love before it all ended.She later teased on numerous occasions that the song as she originally wrote it lasted about ten minutes, but verses were cut for time.Gyllenhaal, though, denied knowing anything about being featured on her album.'Do I [have a song]? I don't know,' he told Howard Stern in 2015.",
        "The song would have firmly been in Swift's past had it not been for the drama with her masters. In 2009, after Scooter Braun purchased her masters, Swift accused him of exerting 'tyrannical control' over her music, and the two had a bitter feud in the press.At the urging of fans, Swift began rerecording all of the songs for which he owned the masters, which she has started to release \u2014 including several never-before-released tracks on each one.She released a 10-minute long, deeply personal version of All Too Well, which offered added new dramatic details in recounting their romance, singing that she was in 'hell' and felt 'shame.'Most damning, though were revelations that Gyllenhaal told Swift the problem was their age difference.July- October 2012: CONNOR KENNEDY\u00a0",

Kennedy, Jr. and the late Mary Kennedy - were first spotted together at the Kennedy family home in Hyannisport in July 2012.But the summer romance barely lasted three months. Insiders said Taylor - who was four years older than Conor - freaked the 18-year-old by coming on too strong - and because of her apparent obsession with his famous family.'Conor's just an 18-year-old kid and wasn't ready for anything super serious,' a pal told RadarOnline.com.'But Taylor is looking for her soulmate and it kind of freaked him out with how strong she came on,' the insider went on.The friend also said that Taylor was obsessed with the Kennedy family - and was living out a fairytale with Conor.'She was more obsessed with the idea of dating a Kennedy, than the actual Kennedy she was dating,' the pal added.December 2012 - January 2013: HARRY STYLES\u00a0",
        "Fledgling couple Harry and Taylor dated from November 2012, with a source telling The Sun at the time: 'Harry is head over heels for Taylor and even admitted he loves her while they were in the Big Apple.'However they split just three months later in January 2013.At the time it was reported she had ended their fling after an angry row during their New Year's vacation.He is largely believed to be the inspiration for her tracks Style and Out Of The Woods, both off of the album 1989.In 2015, she admitted she always knew her relationship with Harry was doomed for fail.In a video posted to celebrate the one year anniversary of her hit album 1989, she revealed that the number one feeling she felt during her three month fling with the One Direction singer was 'anxiety'.Before belting out a one-off acoustic version of Out Of The Woods, she elaborated on the relationship that inspired the song.'I'm going to play you a song that I wrote about a relationship that I was in that the number one feeling I felt in the whole relationship was anxiety,' she explained as she sat at her piano.",
        "'Because it felt very fragile, it felt very tentative. And it always felt like, \"Okay, what's the next road block? What's the next thing that's gonna deter this?'How long do we have before this turns into just an awful mess and we break up? Is it a month? Is it three days?\"The former One Direction-er previously spoke about Taylor's songwriting back in 2017.He kept coy about the songs, but defended Taylor against critics telling Rolling Stone: 'I mean, I don't know if [Out Of The Woods and Style] about me or not, but the issue is, she's so good, they're bloody everywhere.\u2019March 2015 - June 2016: CALVIN HARRIS\u00a0",
        "Taylor is rumored to have started their relationship after meeting the hunk at a BRIT Awards after party in London in February 2015.However the couple ended up splitting in 2016 after a very public romance, with reports stating the relationship had ended because he was 'jealous' of the superstar singer's success.Calvin later accused Taylor's team of leaking that she had secretly written the lyrics for his hit track with Rihanna, This Is What You Came For.\u00a0He wrote soon at the time: 'Hurtful to me at this point that her and her team would go so far out of their way to try and make ME look bad at this stage though. I figure if you're happy in your new relationship you should focus on that instead of trying to tear your ex bf down for something to do.\u00a0'I know you're off tour and you need someone new to try and bury like Katy [Perry] ETC but I'm not that guy, sorry. I won't allow it. Please focus on the positive aspects of YOUR life because you've earned a great one. God bless everyone have a beautiful day.'Calvin later admitted 'all hell broke loose' when he split from Taylor.",
        "He told GQ: 'It's very difficult when something I consider so personal plays out very publicly. The aftermath of the relationship was way more heavily publicized than the relationship itself.'When we were together, we were very careful for it not to be a media circus. She respected my feelings in that sense. I'm not good at being a celebrity.'He continued: 'But when it ended, all hell broke loose. Now I see that Twitter thing as a result of me succumbing to pressure. It took me a minute to realize that none of that matters. I'm a positive guy. For both of us it was the wrong situation.

'That's the truth.
