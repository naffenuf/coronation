        "Billions of people across five continents could have the chance to see a deep penumbral eclipse this Friday as it is peaks at 6.22pm BST.The phenomenon occurs when the Earth comes between the Sun and the Moon, blocking light from reaching the lunar surface.Earth's outer shadow - known as its penumbra - will be cast on the moon as a result, causing a subtle lighting change.'The shadow of a planet produces an umbral and penumbral shadow depending on the location of the planet and the Sun. The darkest eclipses occur when the moon moves through the Earth's umbral shadow,'\u00a0\u00a0Professor Don Pollacco of the University of Warwick told MailOnline.",
        "'A penumbral eclipse occurs as the moon moving through the shadow of the Earth.'",
        "An eclipse occurs any time\u00a0a planet or moon passes between another planet, moon or the sun.Depending on their orbits, they can be total or partial.A lunar eclipse is a specific event which happens when Earth lines up directly between the sun and the moon.When this happens, Earth blocks the light from the sun to the moon. Earth's shadow then falls on the moon.During a lunar eclipse, we can see Earth's shadow on the moon.They can last for several hours, but it is rare for a period of total eclipse to last longer than 100 minutes.\u00a0\u00a0 At least two lunar eclipses happen every year.",
        "People across large parts of Europe, Africa, Asia Australia and even Antarctica may have the chance to view this\u00a0penumbral eclipse.At this time of year, the moon is typically referred to as the\u00a0'Flower Moon', 'Milk Moon' or 'Corn Planting Moon' - inspired by blooming plants during early May.\u00a0Unfortunately,\u00a0it is unlikely that people in the US and the UK will see the eclipse's effects this time.The event is expected to commence at 4.14pm BST on May 5 and last for just over four hours before ending at 8.31pm.While this will be the deepest penumbral lunar eclipse to occur until September 2042, weather and patience is still required to observed these.Professor\u00a0Don Pollacco added that spotting the moon's darkening can be quite difficult due to the sun's continued illumination.Yet during total lunar eclipses the Sun does not illuminate the Moon, often causing the lunar surface to change colour.'For a total Lunar eclipse, totality lasts hours. During these eclipses, the Sun does not illuminate the Moon, but instead light from the Sun goes through the Earth's atmosphere and reaches the Lunar surface,'\u00a0Professor Don Pollacco said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'It is then reflected back to us. So instead of the Moon disappearing, it gets faint and often turns dark red \u2013 an impressive sight. Because whole hemispheres can see the eclipse these are much less rare than a Solar Eclipse and usually a typical location can see one of these every year.'",
        "This year's\u00a0penumbral eclipse also comes as the\u00a0Eta Aquarid meteor shower is set to peak between midnight and dawn on May 6.This spectacle will be visible from the UK in predawn hours but favours the Southern Hemisphere overall, according to Royal Museums Greenwich.Eta Aquarids are created from the debris left behind by Halley's Comet and happen every year from the middle of April until the end of May.Professor Don Pollacco explained: 'The Earth passes through a number of comet orbits every year and at these times we see an increase in meteor activity, depending on the density of dust previously ejected from the comet.\u00a0'The Eta Aquarid meteor shower, so called because the radiant is in the constellation of Aquarius, occurs when the Earth crosses through the orbit of a comet called Halley.\u00a0'These meteors are best seen from the southern hemisphere where the radiant in Aquarius is better seen. From the UK you might expect to see, maybe, 10 meteors an hour in clear, dark conditions.'",
        "A penumbral lunar eclipse occurs when the Sun, Earth, and Moon align in an almost straight lineWhen this happens, the Earth blocks some of the Sun's light from directly reaching the Moon's surface, and covers a part of the Moon with the outer part of its shadow, also known as the penumbra\u00a0This kind of eclipse happens between 0 and 9 times per century on average. The last one took place on March 14, 2006. The next is due in August 29, 2059\u00a0A total lunar eclipse of the moon happens when the\u00a0inner part of Earth's shadow, called the umbra, falls on the moon's face. At mid-eclipse, the entire moon is in shadow and can appear blood red"
