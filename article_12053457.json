        "Waving their Union Jack flags, fans who managed to bag a prime spot at the front of the metal barriers erupted in applause as King Charles and Camilla travelled in the Diamond Jubilee coach to Westminster Abbey.Others opted to use Hyde Park's big screens to watch the full ceremony, with chants of God Save The King ringing out across central London as the historic event unfolded.Royal supporters desperate to get in on the celebrations filled the Mall from the early hours of this morning, with police turning away disappointed masses who were still trying to secure a spot.Die-hard royal fans decked out in red white and blue, who had secured their positions after camping out for days, were told to take down their tents to fit the maximum number of people into viewing areas.In true British fashion, the millions who flocked to the capital were undeterred by the British weather, putting up their brollies and donning raincoats as they celebrated.",
        "Wave upon wave of spectators attempted to secure a spot to watch the procession from Buckingham Palace\u00a0this morning, with crowds over a dozen people deep building hours before proceedings were due to get underway.Marshalls in high viz jackets controlled the numbers of people entering the area to avoid crushing but huge queues quickly built up at the entrance points to The Mall.",
        "There were heated arguments amongst royal super-fans who had camped out to get the best spots, with many jostling to secure a front row view as early as 5am this morning.As the morning went on, there were angry scenes as people were turned away from joining those massed against metal barriers having been told the viewing area was full.Hundreds of royal fans were left disappointed as the Met Police said there was no space for new arrivals with all entrance points to Athena Mall closed off.The roads running parallel to The Mall were choked full of disappointed and angry royal fans unable to get close enough to witness the historic occasion.Jenny Adams stood outside a gate near Admiralty Arch pleading to be allowed inside- but contract security guards refused to allow her in.One woman was close to tears as she pleaded to be allowed through to join friends - eventually barging past contractors forming a line on the pavement.\u00a0Others stood at iron gates on tip toes hoping to catch a glimpse of the procession.The feared rainy weather arrived as hundreds of thousands of spectators waited patiently for the start of the procession.",
        "By 7am crowds either side of The Mall were 15 deep with spectators. The array of tents that had sprung up close to Buckingham Palace had been taken down and replaced by royal fans.",
        "As dawn broke over London many royal fans bagged a spot on steps close to Admiralty Arch and were happy to sit and wait for the procession to begin.\u00a0Concession stands selling bacon rolls did a roaring trade while the queue for a mobile coffee shop stretched more than 50 yards.As viewing areas filled up, more and more royal fans have been opting to watch the procession live on one of the four big screens set up around central London.\u00a0",
        "Live TV feeds have been set up around Hyde Park on old football pitches near the Serpentine, and thousands of fans have already secured their spots on picnic blankets and camping chairs.A lucky few have been given seats on a\u00a0specially-built grandstand\u00a0in front of Buckingham Palace.Almost 4,000 Armed Forces veterans, NHS workers and members of royal charities, received invitations to have a front row seat on the historic day.",
        "Many of those in the various crowds around the capital took selfies with those decked out in brightly coloured outfits as a memento.Werner Marx drew attention with his Union Jack suit while Carmel Flynn who had her face painted red, white and blue happily posed with other royal fans.Police were cheered and clapped as they walked along The Mall to take up position ahead of the procession due to leave Buckingham Palace at 10.20am.",
        "Royal fans began arriving from dawn attempting to get as close as they could to Westminster Abbey in the hope of securing a vantage point.Terry Duncan, 42 beamed: 'I drove down from Yorkshire through the night just to be here. It's such an historic occasion and I really wanted to be a part of it. It's wonderful and somehow doesn't feel real. I feel as if I'm in a fairy tale seeing London dressed up like this and being part of this wonderful occasion.'Anita Parkes, 51 from Harrow, London said: 'It's such an important, historic day and I just wanted to be part of it. It wouldn't have felt the same sitting at home watching it on the television.",
        "'It's a fantastic occasion and I can't wait to see Charles, Camilla and the rest of the Royal Family. It's what makes this country great, and I'm really made up that I'm here to see a once in a lifetime event.'Alan Houghton, 39 who was with his partner Sheila Roberts, 36 said: 'We came for the Queen's funeral and it's so lovely to return to Westminster Abbey for such a happy and important occasion. We got here early because we wanted to get a good spot and it's going to get even more crowded, but it will have been worth it.'",
        "But many faced disappointment as access to roads leading to the Abbey was closed by police early due to the large volume of crowds.Osvaldo Gutierrez, 29 from Spain who was visiting London with his friend Ricardo Lopez said: 'We were planning to visit London anyhow and only realised that the coronation was happening when we got here a few days ago.",
        "'It's wonderful to be here to witness such a beautiful occasion and we just had to come, even though it's a very early start and we can't even see the Abbey. We have a royal family in Spain but don't go as made for them as they do here in the UK. It's a little different to how we do things in Spain but it's great to be here and feel a part of this special event.'Many spectators gathered along Bird Cage Walk, which runs parallel to The Mall to watch troops marching towards Buckingham Palace to meet the King for the start of the day's ceremonies.Friends Carol Sakundiak and Debbie Shimming flew from their home in Canada and were eagerly awaiting the start of the procession.'This is our first ever visit to the UK and we just wanted to be here to show our support for the Royal family. There is such a great atmosphere and we are thrilled to be here'",
        "Alongside them Lorraine Wright and Jane Sheldon stood out with glittering gold crowns.The friends from Northamptonshire handed round cakes to friends having bagged a spot on the front step alongside the Institute of Contemporary Arts.'We were planning to get closer on The Mall but sitting here we have a great view' said Lorraine.Many in the crowds were decked out in a riot of colour - mostly a patriotic red, white and blue.",

I really do think there is a great affection for Charles and it is going to be spectacular.'Willie Adams, 41, was with his wife Julie and said they had carefully planned where to stand and watch the procession.'We decided to avoid too close to the Palace as everyone will want to see them on the balcony, and I think that will just be too busy.'We went to the Queen's funeral which was of course very sad, so this is great that it will be a happy occasion. All the pomp and ceremony will be such a wonderful sight to see. Its what this country does best.'",
        "As dawn broke over the Mall the die hard fans who had camped out for several nights emerged \u2013 exhausted but excited.Some were seen taking a well-earned nap in camping chairs before a long day of standing.Pat McDonald, 52, from Loughborough, said: 'It has been very tiring but once I've had my first cup of coffee, I will feel much better.'People were so excited last night we did not get much sleep, but we can always rest afterwards. This is a moment in history and not one I would want to miss.'When I see Charles and Camilla I'll be waving a cheering. It will be special to see them wave back.'",
        "The biggest concern for many of those who had camped out was that their view might be blocked by one of the 11,000 police officers on duty as they take their place on The Mall.The minicamp city that had sprung up was quickly disassembled with no sign of the blue tarpaulins that many had sheltered under when they were hit by a sudden downpour on Friday afternoon.",

        "'I'm sure the Queen is somewhere looking down on Charles with pride.'Ms Thompson said the atmosphere on The Mall over the last few days had been 'wonderful' although there was a 'tense' situation this morning when the road opened and crowds pushed forward.She added: 'There was a steady build of people as soon as they opened The Mall and there was a lot of pushing forward and a few tempers frayed.'But overall the atmosphere has been wonderful, we've made friends from all around the World. We've met so many Americans who have travelled here for the Coronation and French...which is strange when you think what they did to their own monarchy!'Friends Gillian Anderson 39 and Deborah Imber, 45, have also been camping out on The Mall.",

I don't understand why there was so much controversy.'I will say it to show I support the King and the Royal family and that I hope he has a good and long reign. It's no different to the national anthem.",

It's really special.",
