        "Stargazers in Australia and Asia had the best seats for the year\u2019s first lunar eclipse.",
        "The four-hour eclipse got under way late on Friday or early on Saturday, depending on the location, as the moon slipped into the fringes of Earth\u2019s shadow.In what is known as a penumbral lunar eclipse, the full moon passed within the outer part of Earth\u2019s shadow, causing the moon to dim only slightly.Such an eclipse is not as dramatic as a partial lunar eclipse or a total lunar eclipse when the moon, Earth and sun are perfectly aligned. Even subtle astronomical events like this one make me excited and happy to share them  Astrophysicist Gianluca Masi  The eclipse was visible from beginning to end, weather permitting, as far west as Saudi Arabia and Africa\u2019s western coast, as far east as Japan and New Zealand\u2019s South Island, and from the South Pole to Siberia.It was visible across almost all of Europe.The Virtual Telescope Project planned to livestream the moon rising over the countryside in Tuscany, Italy.\u201cEven subtle astronomical events like this one make me excited and happy to share them,\u201d astrophysicist Gianluca Masi, the project\u2019s founder, said.The next lunar eclipse in October will put on a better display.The eastern portions of both Americas will get to see at least part of a partial lunar eclipse, when some but not all of the moon passes through the Earth\u2019s dark, central shadow. Asia, Africa and Europe will be treated to the whole show.",
        "A total lunar eclipse is not due until 2025 with North America and the western half of South America in front-row seats."
