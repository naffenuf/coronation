I cried on the way here a little bit,' Cara - who created a capsule 'Cara Loves Karl' collection last year - admitted to Vogue on Monday.",
        "'It's a wonderful thing to be able to do this and honor such an incredible person - not only in fashion but personally as a friend. I owe him so much and it's an amazing way to remember him.'Delevingne transformed into 'Cara Lagerfeld' by donning a 'silvery blue' short wig by Noah Scott, which was coiffed into textured waves by hairstylist Danielle Priano.Meanwhile, the star's beauty look was created by makeup artists Hung Vanngo - who revealed he prepped the supermodel's skin with Cetaphil products to avoid aggravating her psoriasis.\u00a0The Carnival Row star donned a white custom Karl Lagerfeld mini shirt-dress, black thigh-high leg warmers, matching stilettos, fingerless gloves, and Chrome Hearts jewelry selected by styling duo Rob Zangardi and Mariel Haenn.",

        "But no one would know Delevingne had she not been the nepotistically-privileged granddaughter of publishing magnate Sir Jocelyn Stevens and goddaughter of Joan Collins.The decision to honour Karl has sparked controversy given the many offensive remarks he has made over the years, from slamming the #MeToo movement to opposing same-sex marriage.'I'm against it for a very simple reason: In the 60s they all said we had the right to the difference. And now, suddenly, they want a bourgeois life,' he told Vice of same-sex marriage.",
        "'It's difficult to imagine\u2014one of the papas at work and the other at home with the baby. How would that be for the baby? I don't know. I see more lesbians married with babies than I see boys married with babies. And I also believe more in the relationship between mother and child than in that between father and child.'While he ultimately showed his support for same-sex marriage at his spring 2013 Chanel haute couture show, he still said he was 'less keen' on same-sex couples adopting children, according to AP."
