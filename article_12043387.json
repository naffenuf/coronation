        "The King has directed a change in the wording of official prayers for the royal family, replacing \u201cCamilla the Queen Consort\u201d with \u201cQueen Camilla\u201d from the day of the coronation.",
        "A Royal Warrant was issued on Wednesday, three days before Charles and Camilla are set to be crowned in Westminster Abbey.It indicates that, with effect from May 6, every prayer for the royal family in any form of service authorised for use in the Church of England should use \u201cQueen Camilla\u201d instead of the words \u201cCamilla the Queen Consort\u201d.",
        "Charles is, as monarch, the Supreme Governor of the Church, and the change also amends the prayer for the royal family in the Church of England\u2019s Book of Common Prayer.The prayer will now read: \u201cAlmighty God, the fountain of all goodness, we humbly beseech thee to bless Queen Camilla, William Prince of Wales, the Princess of Wales, and all the Royal Family: Endue them with thy Holy Spirit, enrich them with thy heavenly grace; prosper them with all happiness; and bring them to thine everlasting kingdom, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.\u201d\u201cQueen Camilla\u201d appeared officially for the first time on the coronation invitations, with Buckingham Palace saying the May 6 ceremony was the appropriate time to start using the title in an official capacity.",
        "Years of debate followed Camilla\u2019s wedding to Charles in 2005, when aides said she \u201cintended\u201d to be known as \u201cPrincess Consort\u201d when her husband became monarch.",
        "The late Queen backed Camilla to be Queen Consort in a Jubilee masterstroke, and the former Duchess of Cornwall has been referred to by the Palace as such since the King\u2019s accession.The wife of a king automatically becomes a queen and only a change in legislation would have prevented Camilla from being so.The change was issued in a Lambeth Palace circular, and the warrant will be published in the London Gazette, the UK\u2019s official public record."
