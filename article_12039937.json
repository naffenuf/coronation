        "Two-time Golden Globe winner Madonna renewed hope her 'scrapped,' self-directed Universal Pictures biopic - titled Little Sparrow - might get resurrected after she and three-time Emmy winner Julia Garner hung out in Manhattan's Flatiron district on Sunday night.",
        "The 64-year-old Queen of Pop - who boasts 51.3M social media followers - Instastoried a snap of herself munching on French fries with the 29-year-old actress, declaring: 'B**** we're Madonna!'After the Met Gala, Michigan-born Madge and Bronx-born Julia attended the 58th birthday of famed lensman Steven Klein at immersive fine-dining restaurant Journey featuring 'floor-to-ceiling and tabletop 360 projection mapping' - according to the New York Post.It's been nearly a year since Garner was first attached to star in the biopic, but she told ET on March 12 she was still optimistic: 'I don't want to tell too much. I want to keep things... yeah, fingers crossed!'On August 26, the gossip site DeuxMoi shared an anonymous tip indicating that Sparrow was a 'nightmare production' because of the 'script and constant changes' and 'might not happen' because it's 'costing a ton of money.'",
        "Madonna co-wrote the gritty script with Oscar-winning screenwriter Diablo Cody, who was later replaced by Independent Spirit Award-winning screenwriter Erin Wilson (The Girl on the Train, Secretary).The seven-time Grammy winner met with Uncut Gems alum Julia Fox last year to discuss the prospect of her portraying her longtime gal pal Debi Mazar.Worryingly, Madonna previously helmed two dismally-reviewed box office bombs - Filth and Wisdom in 2008 and W.E. in 2011.",
        "Regardless of whether Sparrow gets greenlit, the Ozark star wrapped her role in Natalie Erika James' London-set psychological horror film Apartment 7A on June 4 alongside Alone Together star Jim Sturgess and two-time Oscar winner Dianne Wiest.Meanwhile, the self-made superstar - who's determined to 'look more like her old self' - has been hard at work rehearsing for her sold-out 81-date The Celebration Tour, which will be her biggest production yet in honor of her four-decade career.Rehearsals began the week of April 6 for Madonna's 12th concert tour, which marks her first greatest hits tour and the first time she's not promoting a specific studio album.The Hang Up songstress is scheduled to kick off The Celebration Tour on July 15 at Rogers Arena in Vancouver with RuPaul's Drag Race #8 champ Bob the Drag Queen as her opening act.Here's hoping things go better this time as Madonna's knee and hip injuries forced her to cancel 14 shows of her prior 75-date The Madame X Tour back in 2019-2020.",
        "On February 27, 2020 - the twice-divorced mother-of-six injured her coccyx 'when a chair was literally pulled out from underneath' her onstage Le Grand Rex in Paris and she called herself 'a broken doll held together with tape and glue.'",
        "'If only knees didn't twist and cartilage didn't tear and nothing hurt and tears never fell out of our eyes,' Madonna lamented on Instagram at the time.'But alas they do and thank god for this important reminder that we are human.'As the coronavirus pandemic put the final nail in her tour's coffin, the Material Girl decided to finally undergo knee surgery in April 2020 followed by hip surgery in November 2020 as well as 'regenerative treatment for my missing cartilage.'"
