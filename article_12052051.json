        "Tuesday's federal budget will include a rescue and repair package for key sites the government says are decaying and dangerous.They include World Heritage-listed Cockatoo Island, where sea walls are cracked, pylons holding up wharves are eroding, and buildings are closed due to safety concerns.Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek says the cash will address a critical backlog of repairs left by the former government.\"Many of these sites are in a dangerous state of disrepair, putting their environmental and heritage values at risk,\" she says.\"Without urgent action, the future of these famous sites is at risk.\"The money includes $7.6m to address safety concerns such as rock falls from cliffs and $26.5m to replace rotting wharves and docks."
