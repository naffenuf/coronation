        "The Foxes travelled to London for the first of their final four games which will decide Leicester's Premier League fate just seven years after lifting the famous trophy.\u00a0\u00a0Footage showed visiting fans yelling 'You're not fit to wear the shirt!' in the direction of the leaving Leicester players\u00a0after their first-half collapse.Dean Smith's side showed a little more fightback, scoring three times in the second half, but also conceded a further two to lose the match 5-3.\u00a0\u00a0The result is likely to be a pivotal one in Leicester's bid to escape relegation from the Premier League - just seven years after their top-flight triumph in the 2015-2016 season.\u00a0",

        "Dean Smith was brought in to Leicester last month to try and get the team out of danger following the sacking of Brendan Rodgers, but performances like this mean that there are serious fears the Foxes will be plying their trade in the Championship in August.",
