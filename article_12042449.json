        "Prepared to do more if needed -PowellGold well-positioned to push toward record highs -trader(Adds analyst comment, remarks by Fed chair, and updates prices)By Deep Kaushik VakilMay 3 (Reuters) - Gold firmed on Wednesday after a brief jump to nearly 1% as the U.S. Federal Reserve delivered a widely expected rate hike and signalled a pause in further increases.Spot gold was 0.4% higher at $2,024.19 per ounce by 3:25 p.m. EDT (19:25 GMT) after touching its highest since April 14 at $2,036.15 earlier.U.S. gold futures settled up 0.7% at $2,037.The Fed raised interest rates by a quarter percentage point to quell the inflationary pressures that have kept price rises well above its 2% target.It also signalled a pause in further increases to assess the fallout from recent bank failures, wait on the resolution of a political standoff over the U.S. debt ceiling, and monitor the course of inflation.\"Gold's ability to finish unchanged despite hawkish hints from (Fed Chair Jerome) Powell, positions it well for a fresh push toward all-time highs now that the Fed is on pause and the debt ceiling situation looks increasingly dire,\" said Tai Wong, an independent metals trader based in New York.The Fed chiefsaid \"we are prepared to do more\" with rate rises if needed, but added they may not be far off, and possibly at, a \"sufficiently restrictive\" level to return inflation to target.",
        "The U.S. dollar index fell 0.6%, making bullion more expensive for buyers holding other currencies, while benchmark 10-year Treasury yields also lowered.Non-yielding bullion, a customary safe haven against inflation and economic uncertainty, draws lower demand when higher interest rates boost returns on competing assets with yields.\"Concerns regarding U.S. regional banks and the debt ceiling suggest further price volatility is in the offing,\" said Standard Chartered analyst Suki Cooper.Gold prices had gained 1% in April as the U.S. banking crisis spurred a flight to safety.Silver was up 0.1% to $25.41 per ounce, platinum shed 1.4% to $1,050.64 while palladium dropped 0.3% to $1,425.68.
