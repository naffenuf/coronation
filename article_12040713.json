        "A baby who was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis at just 20 days old and has a rare one in two billion genotype \u2013 meaning \u201cthere\u2019s probably more chance of him winning the lottery twice in one go\u201d \u2013 needs funds for new treatment to help him live \u201cclose to a normal life\u201d.",
        "Jason Moore\u2019s son Luca, a \u201chappy, chatty\u201d and \u201ccheeky\u201d 19-month-old, was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis (CF) \u2013 an inherited condition that causes sticky mucus to build up in the lungs and digestive system \u2013 at nearly three weeks old after a blood screening.",
        "Jason, 34, a personal trainer, and his partner Becki, 31, a paediatric nurse, have to give Luca several different medications each day and assist him with physio sessions, which involve moving his body to help him clear the mucus, which is like \u201cglue\u201d, from his lungs.The couple, who live in Southampton, \u201cchase him around the house, throw him up in the air\u201d, and \u201cbounce him around\u201d, as the more he laughs and coughs, the easier it is for him to breathe.",
        "While Luca is \u201calways smiling\u201d and loves being outside and playing football, Jason said his son is among the 10% of people with CF who cannot currently benefit from modulators \u2013 a form of treatment for the condition \u2013 or are unable to take them due to the side effects.This is due to his rare genetic make-up \u2013 his genotype \u2013 which Jason said makes him \u201cone of four in the world\u201d.",
        "Jason is on a mission to raise money to fund research into new treatment which could help to change Luca\u2019s life \u201cfor the better\u201d \u2013 and he recently ran the 2023 TCS London Marathon, receiving more than \u00a34,000 in donations for the charity Cystic Fibrosis Trust.",
        "\u201cWe found out that the drugs that are working wonders for people, unfortunately, Luca is not able to benefit from,\u201d Jason said.\u201cThat\u2019s because there are so few people with his genotype, there\u2019s just not been enough testing done\u2026 but we\u2019re not going to stop until he can get that benefit.\u201cOur hope for Luca\u2019s future is that he is happy and able to enjoy life to the fullest and experience the world and all the opportunities he wants to.\u201d",
        "Luca was born on September 4 2021 with no complications, but within the first few days of his life, Jason and Becki noticed he had started \u201cstraining\u201d and tensing his limbs.The couple were reassured by doctors that this was \u201ccompletely normal\u201d, but days later, when Luca was 20 days old, they received the heart-breaking news that he had CF.This followed a blood spot screening, also known as a heel prick test, which involves taking a blood sample to find out if a baby has one of nine rare but serious health conditions.",
        "\u201cIt was tough,\u201d Jason said.\u201cIt\u2019s all a bit of a blur, to be honest, what actually happened at that time.\u201cWe were just told everything, the worst possible outcome, and then they said, \u2018This is how we combat A; this is how we combat B\u2019, and they broke down all his medication.",
        "\u201cThe first couple of days were completely new to us and him, but literally, after a couple of weeks, it became second nature\u2026 and we wouldn\u2019t have him any other way.\u201dThe diagnosis was a \u201chuge shock\u201d, but Jason and Becki were then told \u201cthere are only three other recorded genotypes like Luca\u2019s, so he\u2019s one of four in the world\u201d.Jason said Luca has inherited two different cystic fibrosis genes from each parent, both of which are rare, and those genes together are extremely rare.",
        "He said discovering this days after the CF diagnosis was \u201ccrazy\u201d.\u201cHe\u2019s got such a rare genotype, it\u2019s basically unheard of,\u201d Jason said.\u201cIt\u2019s crazy to hear that there\u2019s probably more chance of him winning the lottery twice in one go than there is of him actually having his genotype.",
        "\u201cSo, for that reason alone, I think he\u2019s going to be a special kid.\u201dLuca has to take many different medications each day, including antibiotics; Creon, which aids digestion; salt; an inhaler to deliver medicine directly into the lungs; and omeprazole to treat reflux.He has physio sessions at least twice a day to help him clear the build-up in his lungs and chest, and has monthly check-ups at Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester.",
        "According to Cystic Fibrosis Trust, people with CF are vulnerable to different bacteria which can be harmful, so Luca\u2019s hygiene is extremely important \u2013 and his risk of contracting infections prevents him from doing certain activities.Jason said his son cannot play in paddling pools, rivers or sandpits, and cannot use bath toys which have any holes in them due to the risk of bacteria, such as Pseudomonas, developing.This poses challenges for the family but Jason and Becki try to find a balance so he \u201cdoesn\u2019t miss out\u201d.",
        "\u201cI always dreamed of having a little boy who\u2019s just going to play and get his hands dirty \u2013 go out, fall and just get back up again,\u201d Jason said.\u201cBut whenever I see him falling now, I think, \u2018Oh, I need to go and wipe his hands\u2019.\u201cI never really wanted to be that dad, and I\u2019m sure Becki didn\u2019t want to be that kind of mum, but that is definitely where it\u2019s affected me, mentally.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s trying to find a balance so that he doesn\u2019t miss out.\u201dJason said Luca is \u201calways smiling\u201d and \u201ctrying to make everyone laugh\u201d, despite living with CF \u2013 and he wants to \u201clet him live as much as possible\u201d without too many restrictions.This inspired him to run the London Marathon to help increase awareness of CF and raise funds for further research into new treatment which would allow Luca to live a more \u201cnormal\u201d life.",
        "He completed the race in three hours and 56 minutes and has raised more than \u00a34,000 so far \u2013 but Jason and Becki do not want to stop there, as they are hoping to double this figure and are organising a CF charity golf day.Jason said Luca is \u201ca very clever boy\u201d and \u201chas a real understanding of life already\u201d, but having access to the right treatment would change his life significantly and \u201cfor the better\u201d, as he would not have to take as many medications and his lung function would improve.",
        "\u201cHe\u2019s a cutie; everyone who meets him just loves him,\u201d Jason said.\u201cMy dad said to me that where he lacks in something, which is obviously his CF, then he\u2019s going to make up for it in something else, and I think he genuinely will.",
        "\u201cGetting access to treatment that he\u2019s eligible for would change daily life for him in a way where he wouldn\u2019t have to take as much medication, and his lung health would improve.\u201cSo it would be very close to a normal life.\u201cHe would still have to be aware and conscious of his surroundings, and probably set certain rules for himself as he gets older, but daily life would certainly change for the better.\u201d",
