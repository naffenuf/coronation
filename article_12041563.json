        "Rob Baxter says Exeter do not shoulder responsibility for Wales centre Joe Hawkins\u2019 controversial World Cup omission.",
        "Hawkins was left out of Wales\u2019 preliminary World Cup training squad on Monday following his move from Ospreys to Exeter.The 20-year-old will join the Devon club this summer and, with five caps, has less than the 25 needed to continue at international level and play outside Wales.",
        "National-team head coach Warren Gatland said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d to lose Hawkins for the World Cup in France later this year after Wales\u2019 Professional Rugby Board told him he was ineligible upon studying documentation over the timing of his move to England.Hawkins, who was first named in a national squad in October 2022 and made his debut against Australia the following month, could still have been deemed available for Wales by eligibility rules if he was uncapped when he signed his Exeter contract.Exeter rugby director Baxter said: \u201cWe don\u2019t take any responsibility because we approached it completely with open arms, with the anticipation that he would play for Wales.\u201cWe felt that we had got everything in place we needed to. We complied with what we were asked to do with the information we had.\u201cObviously Wales feel there\u2019s stuff that doesn\u2019t prove certain dates and times that they wanted. We haven't done anything wrong, we certainly haven't broken any rules  Exeter rugby director Rob Baxter  ",
        "\u201cWe haven\u2019t done anything wrong, we certainly haven\u2019t broken any rules.\u201cI think what will surprise people is how early we looked at Joe. He was playing under-20s rugby and I was watching those games with players we\u2019ve got here.\u201cWe\u2019ve been looking at him for years basically. Whatever has happened has happened, but we\u2019ll get on with it and support Joe in what he wants to do.\u201dThe spotlight was shone on Wales\u2019 eligibility rules after Gatland named a 54-man squad that, while omitting Hawkins, did include former England prop Henry Thomas, France-bound Dragons forward Will Rowlands and Japan-based Cory Hill.",
        "Thomas, capped seven times by England between 2013 and 2014, has served World Rugby\u2019s stand down period of three years to represent another country.The 31-year-old Montpellier tighthead has not been capped by Wales, so is not affected by the 25-cap criteria.Thomas would, however, have to play in Wales after his current Montpellier deal expires should he be capped in the meantime.Rowlands has won 23 caps and his registration will remain in Wales before he joins Paris-based Racing 92 next season.",
        "Two World Cup warm-up games against England and another with South Africa in August could take Rowlands to the 25-cap mark.Asked if he was surprised by Hawkins\u2019 World Cup omission, Baxter said he was a \u201clittle bit\u201d, but added: \u201cIt certainly isn\u2019t my place to be critical of the WRU (Welsh Rugby Union).",
        "\u201cI\u2019ve got to be very careful without knowing in depth what the situation is in Wales, what the regions\u2019 thoughts are on it.\u201cThere is a lot going on within rugby across the world, a lot going on in the Premiership.\u201cBut if Wales decide they don\u2019t want to take Joe to the World Cup then that\u2019s their decision.\u201d"
