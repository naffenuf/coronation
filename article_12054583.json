        "What a lost opportunity for the United States.",
        "Had Harry and Meghan the grace to accept largesse and privilege, they would have played a key role at the coronation of King Charles III and Queen Consort Camilla.Surely they would have been front-row.Surely they would have had a place on the balcony.And surely U.S. would have been represented in Great Britain as never before \u2014 as part of the monarchy! Never underestimate how awed we Americans are by British pomp and circumstance, the history that dwarfs our own, the displays of military might and national pride.The coronation matters to us, too.Saturday\u2019s ceremony also offered a reassuring display of familial unity, doubtless forged in the crucible of Harry and Meghan\u2019s repeated betrayals.",
        "To watch Charles\u2019s coronation was to be reminded of his kindness towards Meghan at her wedding, of him walking her halfway up the aisle, literally guiding her through her first major royal ceremony. There was a callback to that today, Harry and Meghan\u2019s wedding gospel choir singing \u2018Alleluia (O Sing Praises)\u2019 in Westminster Abbey.It seemed a graceful olive branch, though one likely to be swatted away.That tends to happen when one's default setting is grievance. Doubtless we\u2019ll be hearing from Montecito soon about cultural appropriation or some such nonsense.If only Harry and Meghan had the maturity to see what had been right in front of them.",
        "The regret today on Harry\u2019s face, the sheer discomfort as he was made to walk into Westminster Abbey alone, taking a seat in the third row \u2014 same as the disgraced Prince Andrew \u2014 was all too palpable.And well and truly deserved.Pursing his lips, taking an inordinate interest in reading the program, watching Camilla \u2014 who we know Harry despises \u2014 take her place in history was all too satisfying.Clearly, he never learned a simple truism: You get what you give.When he wasn\u2019t obscured by Princess Anne\u2019s red-feathered hat \u2014 shades of Meghan blocked by the candlestick at Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s funeral, cheers to the Palace Brain Trust! \u2014 Harry looked towards William, Kate and their three children (the backs of their heads, anyway) with what seemed like a mixture of longing and regret.Oh, for him to be with them on the front row.",
        "To be the rascally uncle to his youngest rascally nephew. To be in full military regalia rather than a plain black suit \u2014 Dior, but still \u2014 shoulder-to-shoulder with his brother, the future king, cheered on by nations of millions.Alas, it\u2019s all commercial flights and commoners now.All that lost status. All that supercilious lecturing about \u2018unconscious bias\u2019 and institutional racism, and to what end? What greater good?",
        "And here was King Charles, taking the unprecedented step of including leaders from multiple faiths: Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu, Sihk.Here is a new King whose ceremony stressed humility, kindness, service and compassion.One can hear the glassware crashing in Montecito.Compassion has always been Meghan's line, hasn\u2019t it? Kindness. Service. Recall, if you will, her clapback to the Queen, insulting the monarch's lifetime of duty with that petty public statement: 'Service is universal.'Meghan Markle always has to have the last word. Until today.The Royal Family sent her a devastating message without saying a thing.No amount of money from Netflix or Spotify, no amount of party invites from Ellen DeGeneres or dubious humanitarian award ceremonies could ever compare to the power Harry and Meghan would have had as working royals.",
        "Meghan\u2019s biracial heritage and Harry\u2019s ability to connect would not only have further modernized the monarchy but underscored the special relationship between the United States and Great Britain.And they burned it all down. Is it any coincidence that Jill Biden, First Lady of the United States, was seated so far back at the coronation? That Joe Biden, who has expressed public support for the Sussexes, opted not to attend? To snub the new king?Harry and Meghan, burning the bridges they purport to build.",
        "So much for taking down the monarchy. They barely even sideswiped it.Spontaneous applause erupted outside Buckingham Palace the moment Charles was crowned King.As for the notion that Meghan didn\u2019t want to be there \u2014 please. We all read the reports of the back-and-forth between Buckingham Palace and Montecito, the demands the couple were making in exchange for their presence. Who really believes that Meghan Markle choose to miss such a historically significant event for a fourth birthday party?Think of the ways to monetize this most supreme of royal occassions! Content is king, and it looks like we have a second podcast season to fill.But it seems that someone didn\u2019t get what she wanted. And, quite likely, Meghan wanted to avoid a repeat of last time \u2014 a greeting of hearty boos.Meanwhile Catherine, Princess of Wales, looked impeccably regal in her McQueen gown, dazzling headpiece and the late Princess Diana\u2019s earrings \u2013 daughter Charlotte adorable in a miniaturized version of the same look.The actress in Meghan must have been dying. The costuming, the pageantry \u2014 the fealty on display!",
        "The sheer stagecraft and statecraft. The anointing of Kate as Diana\u2019s successor. Frostbitten todgers, Elizabeth Arden cream and sex next to a box of Diana\u2019s hair be damned!",
        "Hope spilling to Oprah was worth it.To see the thousands of Britons lining the streets in the rain, camped out for days, cheering on their new King and Queen as four thousand troops marched through the streets was to wonder: Do Harry and Meghan get it now?Sorry \u2014 that\u2019s a rhetorical question. They\u2019re likely too narcissistic to ever get it. The rest of us do, though.How grievously they miscalculated. How silly Harry was to think he could insult his closest family members in his Netflix series and sundry interviews and his book \u2014 and then think they'd welcome him back.This is the father he fantasized about bombing with a jet. There were so many jaw-dropping revelations in Harry's memoir that it's hard to remember them all, but this one has stuck with me: In a bizarre passage praising his father's work ethic \u2014 'his own work was also a kind of religion' \u2014 and detailing his pride in sharing a love of piloting with Charles, he writes, in the same breath, of wanting to blow him up.It reads: 'He drove off. As he went down the track I told the Typhoon [aircraft]: New target. Gray Audi. Headed southeast from my position down track...'The Typhoon tracked Pa, did a low pass straight over him, almost shattering the windows of his Audi.",
        "'But ultimately spared him. On my orders.'A joke, clearly. But revealing, possibly.",
        "It\u2019s amazing Charles included Harry or even wanted him there at all.At ceremony\u2019s end, Harry was left to stand outside in the rain while nearly every other senior member of his family climbed into a horse-drawn carriage, led through the streets to their cheering subjects, taking pride of place on the balcony as he got in his little black car and headed straight to Heathrow, where he was seen smiling for the cameras.See? Harry\u2019s happy! Never been happier, in fact.And we the people \u2014 Brits and Americans \u2014 were never so happy to see the back of him."
