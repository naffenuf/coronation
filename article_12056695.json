        "Accrington boss John Coleman admitted his side \u201chaven\u2019t been good enough\u201d this season after relegation was confirmed despite a 2-1 win at Oxford.",
        "Stanley needed to win and overturn an improbable 16-goal difference to have a chance of staying up but Cambridge\u2019s victory over Forest Green sealed their fate in any case.Billy Bodin put the U\u2019s ahead after eight minutes but Stanley hit back in the second half through substitute Korede Adedoyin and Aaron Pressley.Coleman said: \u201cWe were all over the place in the first half. But we\u2019ve given our all and we thoroughly deserved to win.\u201cYes they had far better chances than us but that\u2019s when your goalkeeper and your defenders need to make a good save or make blocks and we haven\u2019t had enough of that this season.\u201cBut we scored two good goals. The sickening thing is if we\u2019d have won last week, we\u2019d have stayed up. Over the course of the season we haven\u2019t been good enough and we have to accept that.",
        "\u201cWe have to do it the right way and get ourselves back on an even keel, steady the ship and go again for next season. It\u2019s going to be a tough league and we\u2019re going to have to be prepared for a battle.\u201cWe have given away too many chances all season.\u201cWe\u2019ve got to focus our efforts on restructuring the squad, get players in who can compete and produce on a regular basis in League Two, and make sure we don\u2019t go down a slippery pole.",
        "\u201cWe won\u2019t get kidded by the result today \u2013 we\u2019ve just got to sign the right players.\u201cI won\u2019t rush into making decisions about who goes out. I need to get the right decisions so that we find ourselves in a healthier shape than we have this season.\u201dOxford head coach Liam Manning reflected on a poor finish and poor finishing.He said: \u201cIt was very disappointing to lose the game, especially after the number of chances we had. It\u2019s the story of the season for us really.\u201cBut in the bigger picture there\u2019s huge credit to the players for getting it done when they did, getting over the line to stay up.\u201cWe\u2019re missing composure. We create so many chances and we just have to convert them.\u201cWe have to learn from this season. It\u2019s such a difficult division, so competitive, if you don\u2019t have the right culture and the players aren\u2019t all in you can find yourself really up against it.\u201cWe have to make sure we evaluate all of that and put it right for next season.\u201cI\u2019ve had meetings about the building here already. We\u2019ve got a lot of work to do to get the right culture.\u201cSome players will need to move on \u2013 but that\u2019s the same at any club. I will have to make some tough decisions.",
        "\u201cYes, we need a striker or a number nine who scores goals but it\u2019s not just a number nine, we need players all over the park who can score goals from multiple positions.\u201cWhen I came in I had to prioritise key areas because they were playing the game slightly differently to the way I see the game or how I like so it was about altering the shape and the organisation and not giving away goals.\u201cI always felt that we needed to be harder to beat and not keep giving away three or four goals a game.\u201cWe\u2019ll have a look at the squad and then come back in the summer to make sure we do the things we need to get ourselves in the right half of the table next season.\u201d"
