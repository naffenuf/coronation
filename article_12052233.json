        "The city council remains under no overall control but Labour gained eight seats to take its total to 23, putting it in a prime position to organise a minority leadership before the council AGM on May 24.The biggest losers of the day were the Liberal Democrats, who were wiped out by Labour in Blagreaves ward and suffered losses elsewhere to end up with just half of the eight seats that they had at the start of Friday. People are seeing that we're ready for this change now, locally and nationally, the party is functioning and firing on cylinders, and so bring on the general election and let's have change for the country as well as Derby.

I think it's a success, I honestly do. I didn't anticipate making serious gains, and I really didn't expect to lose ground on seats.
