        "Last-placed Wests Tigers have fallen into a second-straight NRL win, edging St George Illawarra 18-16 in a messy Magic Round exchange to heap further pressure on Anthony Griffin.",
        "The Dragons looked set to end a four-game losing streak when returning half Jayden Sullivan scored his second try to put them ahead midway through the second half at Suncorp Stadium on Sunday.But it was Tim Sheens' side, fresh off an upset of defending premiers Penrith last week, who scored against the tide and held on thanks to young fullback Jahream Bula's gutsy try-saver with 90 seconds to play as they claimed their second win of the season.The Dragons looked set to score the match-winner when Ben Hunt soccered a loose pass through the line and regathered.The Dragons had a three-on-one in the right corner but the ball spilled loose and Mikaele Ravalawa was then bumped into touch by Bula.It capped a brilliant fortnight for the fullback, who was sensational against the Panthers last week, and heaped further pain on the Dragons and their coach Griffin.They have now lost five straight games by no more than six points - four of them by two or less - adding to the turbulence as the Dragons' board actively looks at alternative coaching options for 2024.The Tigers, set back by the late withdrawal of John Bateman (hamstring) in the warm-up, led by four points after a fumbling and sometimes bumbling first half.",
        "Winger Ravalawa scored first after Junior Tupou's unforced error from a short Hunt bomb.Starford To'a had the reply for Wests when they regained a cross-field bomb of their own, before Bula's sharp one-handed grab and offload allowed David Nofoaluma to steam over in the corner.The Tigers let the Dragons back into the contest though, Brandon Wakeham's penalty kick not finding touch just minutes after the Tigers five-eighth nailed a 40-20.Fresh off the bench, playmaker Sullivan threw a dummy and raced 25 metres to score.Halftime came as a relief after a comical final few minutes.Dragons fullback Tyrell Sloan took three swipes at a grubber that had bounced off the post, only for Tigers skipper Api Koroisau to knock-on as he attempted to ground the loose ball.Sullivan produced the goods again to put the Dragons ahead, stepping back inside two defenders for his second try and conversion.They looked set to extend their lead but it was Tupou who scored next, darting in at the right corner to put the Tigers up by two with 14 minutes to play.Jack Bird then knocked on playing the ball, Sullivan's end-of-set kick ran into touch and then Bird was caught on the fifth tackle as the Dragons lost their way chasing a reply."
