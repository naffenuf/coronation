        "Lloyds said a \u2018modest\u2019 increase in borrowers in arrears was no cause for alarm as quarterly profits rose to \u00a32.3billion.",
        "Rising interest rates have boosted lenders but squeezed borrowers, some of whom are finding it more difficult to pay.Lloyds, Britain\u2019s biggest mortgage lender, said while more borrowers fell into arrears and defaulted on loans, these were at or below pre-pandemic levels.",
        "Problems mostly related to loans sold before the 2008 crisis when buyers overstretched themselves.\u00a0Chief financial officer William Chalmers said: \u2018It\u2019s very modest and doesn\u2019t cause us any alarm.\u2019The group, which owns Lloyds Bank as well as Halifax and Bank of Scotland, took a \u00a3243million\u00a0charge for the risk of loans going bad.First-quarter profits were up by 46 per cent compared to the same period a year ago as the rise in interest rates boosted the net interest margin, the gap between what lenders earn from borrowers and pay savers.Interest rates are expected to rise even further but the bank did not upgrade its outlook for the full year, signalling caution. Shares fell by 3.6 per cent, or 1.7p, to 45.98p.Lloyds slightly upgraded its outlook for the UK economy but expects GDP to shrink 0.6 per cent in 2023 and house prices to fall 5.3 per cent.Chief executive Charlie Nunn said: \u2018The macro-economic outlook remains uncertain.\u2019Lloyds was the latest UK bank to report quarterly results for the period in which several US lenders collapsed, as well as 167-year-old Credit Suisse.\u00a0",
        "Lloyds seemed to shrug off the crisis as profits beat expectations. But it has seen a fall in deposits of \u00a32.2billion.Smaller rival Metro Bank said it had enjoyed a second quarter of profitability. Metro also saw an outflow of deposits \u2013 of \u00a3400million \u2013 over the period.",
