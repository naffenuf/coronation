        "The Clarity Retreat Necklace is said to be a powerful energy amplifier that helps you manifest what you want in life, while letting go of anything that's not working.The two beauties met at an audition 10 years before Meghan married Prince Harry, and also both starred in US hit TV series Suits together.The duchess, who celebrated her son Archie's birthday on Saturday, effortlessly rocked the statement pieces while hiking out in the fresh air without her husband, Prince Harry, near their $14million Montecito mansion.For her day out, the mother-of-two looked chic in a sporty outfit complete with a $128 J. Crew lightweight jacket\u200b in colour dark moss, and a close-fit black vest and fitted black leggings.She wore her dark tresses pulled back in a low ponytail under a straw fedora hat, and topped off the look with a pair of Victoria Beckham 'Navigator Power' glasses on her makeup-free face.\u00a0",
        "She cut a stylish figure in brown hiking sneakers and thick blue socks, as she made her way along the hiking route with\u00a0friends, Markus Anderson and Heather Dorak.She further accessorised the look with a mauve neck scarf, a yellow gold wedding band, and a Lorraine Schwartz emerald cut diamond pinky ring.Harry, who rushed back to California straight after his father's Coronation, did not seem to attend the hike.",
        "Meghan's latest outing comes just two days after her husband Prince Harry attended his father King Charles' Coronation at Westminster Abbey in London.But the King's son slipped out of the venue with only the briefest of goodbyes and headed straight for Heathrow Airport in a blacked-out electric BMW.After just 28 hours and 42 minutes in the UK, he was back on the plane to California before his father and stepmother Queen Camilla had even finished having their official portraits taken.",
        "He was pictured smiling broadly as he arrived at the airport\u2019s Windsor suite before boarding his British Airways flight - still in morning suit and sporting his medals.But the King's Coronation on Saturday was not the only important date in the family's calendar. It also coincided with son Archie's fourth birthday.Archie was born in 2019 with the Sussexes then having their second child, Lilibet Diana, in 2021."
