        "Lieutenant Colonel John Jones, 92, marched as a Royal Welch Fusiliers soldier\u00a0He was selected to march in front of Queen Elizabeth II's golden state coach\u00a0Follow MailOnline's new Royals channel for all the latest news and updates\u00a0A veteran former Army officer has told of the painstaking preparations and gruelling training regime he underwent as a young soldier chosen to take part in the late Queen\u2019s Coronation procession 70 years ago.\u00a0",
        "Lieutenant Colonel John Jones, 92, was one of 10 fresh faced soldiers from the Royal Welch Fusiliers selected to march in front of Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s golden state coach as she made her way to and from Buckingham Palace.\u00a0He gave a rare insight into the extraordinary plans drawn up by military top brass for the big day which were his personal recollections of the historic event.\u00a0It comes after it was revealed military organisers of the King\u2019s Coronation this weekend studied footage from 1953 to help plan the largest military ceremonial operation for 70 years.\u00a0Mr Jones, from Camberley, Surrey, completed tours of duty in Northern Ireland, Korea, Malaya, Sudan and Cyprus during a distinguished 37 year military career.\u00a0",
        "The retired officer, who was also posted to Singapore and Germany and later went on to work at the Royal Military Academy in Sandhurst, was made an MBE by the late Queen in 1980.\u00a0But in 1953, he was a young sergeant in the regiment after joining up just three years earlier.\u00a0He told how 10 soldiers from each regiment in the British Army were selected to march on the route.\u00a0As one of the senior regiments the Royal Welch Fusiliers were positioned close by as they marched in front of the Royal Carriage, he said.\u00a0",
        "Mr Jones, who grew up in Llansantffraid-ym-Mechain, Powys, said that because of the length of the route, which saw them march for around 15 miles on the day, a high level of fitness was required.\u00a0",
        "He told MailOnline: \u2018The ten of us who were selected were sent to Wrexham to train for a month before the Coronation to ensure we could handle the march.\u00a0\u2018This involved cross country runs and long marches in full kit rifles and the regimental colours.\u00a0\u2018There would be no stopping on the route on the day. Anyone who failed the fitness training would be replaced.\u00a0\u2018After the fitness training we were sent to another base in Birmingham to join up with the other regiments participating in the ceremony to practise with them.\u00a0\u2018All of the training was done on the parade ground/square to rehearse the intricate movements that were required on the march.\u00a0'Several days before the coronation all those taking part moved to Earls Court which was crammed with three tier bunk beds.\u00a0\u2018We were well looked after, catering wise, the food being supplied by the Lyons Company.\u00a0\u2018The week before the coronation, we had to get up early to march and familiarise ourselves with the route. This was the only way we could rehearse.\u00a0",
        "\u2018It was very much like the rehearsals for King Charles\u2019 Coronation this week.\u2019\u00a0Describing the day of the Coronation when three million people lined the streets of the capital he said: \u2018London was vibrant with thousands of visitors from across the world.\u00a0\u2018One has to realise that it wasn\u2019t long since the war ended and Britain was still rationing. In fact, rationing didn\u2019t end until the end of 1954.\u00a0\u2018It was a great opportunity to have something to celebrate and bring the country together.\u00a0\u2018Everything was timed to perfection. Heads of state from around the world were invited. Those from Africa and the Commonwealth wearing their national dress.\u00a0\u2018On Coronation day we rose very early, had very little breakfast and hardly any fluids as we would not be able to stop en route to answer the call of nature.\u00a0\u2018We formed up at 6am. It was raining heavily so we were issued with ponchos, then marched to Constitution Hill.\u00a0",
        "\u2018The parade started at 12 noon when the Queen left Westminster Abbey.\u00a0\u2018The procession formed in front of the Royal Carriage. By the time the Queen left the Abbey it had stopped raining so the ponchos were discarded.\u00a0\u2018The route was absolutely packed and the crowd were ecstatic and very noisy.\u00a0\u2018There were commentators, probably the BBC, along the route providing commentary as the procession marched past.\u00a0",
        "\u2018The planning was so meticulous, we arrived back at Earls Court at 5.55pm - five minutes ahead of schedule.\u00a0\u2018There was a mad rush to get to the toilets after we had discarded their rifles - there were some who didn\u2019t make it!",
        "\u2018After that I went out with my mates to celebrate and witness the firework display.\u2019\u00a0Mr Jones, who is now a grandfather and has three grow- up sons, is planning to watch the King\u2019s Coronation from the comfort of his own home with relatives.\u00a0Mr Jones\u2019 son Nick told how his father would like to trace comrades who were with him and lived in hope that some were still alive.\u00a0He told how his father is a \u2018modest chap\u2019 who rarely spoke about his military days but asked him to recount his memories of the historic day.\u00a0He said the family only discovered by chance the role he played in the Coronation after seeing a photograph he had kept in a box when he and his late wife Eileen were moving home 10 years ago.\u00a0Nick, 68, said: \u2018He\u2019s not one for blowing his own trumpet. It almost came out by accident when we saw the photograph.\u00a0\u2018I knew he had been involved in the Coronation but had no idea of any of the details until 10 years ago.\u00a0",
        "\u2018He met the Queen quite a few times during his career. She was Colonel in Chief of the regiment. He\u2019s always been a royalist and the Queen was always quite important in our house.\u00a0\u2018We\u2019re all very proud of his achievements. He\u2019s quite a remarkable bloke. He served in all the hotspots. He was in Northern Ireland during the Troubles. He went out there four times.\u00a0\u2018He has never really spoken about any of that so I\u2019m making him write up his memoirs now.\u2019"
