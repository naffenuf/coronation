        "Representatives from 12 Commonwealth countries have joined forces to call on the King to acknowledge and apologise for the impacts and ongoing legacy from British \u201cgenocide and colonisation\u201d.",
        "The statement, which has been sent to Charles, calls on Britain\u2019s new monarch to act on the royal family\u2019s recent expressions of sorrow by beginning a process for reparations and returning stolen artifacts and bodily remains.Signatories to the statement include representatives from Australia, New Zealand, The Bahamas and Canada.The statement said: \u201cOur collective Indigenous Rights Organisations among other organisations who are working to help our communities recover from centuries of racism, oppression, colonialism and slavery, now rightly recognized by the United Nations as \u2018Crimes Against Humanity,\u2019 also call for a formal apology and for a process of reparatory justice to commence.\u201d",
        "It outlines five key points, which include: \u201cImmediately start the conversation about slavery\u2019s enduring impact\u201d, \u201cstarting discussions about reparations\u201d, \u201crepatriation of all remains of our collective peoples\u201d, \u201creturn of all of our cultural treasures and artefacts\u201d and \u201cacknowledge and adopt the renunciation of the \u2018Doctrine of Discovery\u2019 made by Pope Francis in April 2023\u201d.One of the representatives, Australian senator Lidia Thorpe, said: \u201cThe British monarchy oversaw the oppression of First Nations peoples in British colonies all over the world. The horrific impacts of British colonisation, including the genocide of our people, theft of our land and denigration of our culture, are still felt today.\u201cThe genocidal project that commenced in 1788 still continues, and neither the British Crown nor the Australian Government have been held to account for the crimes they have committed.",
        "\u201cThis joint statement, from First Nations and human rights advocates across the Commonwealth, calls on King Charles III to make a formal apology and begin a process of repairing the damage of colonisation, including returning the stolen wealth that has been taken from our people.\u201dIn early April, the King expressed his support for the first time for research into the historical links between the British monarchy and the transatlantic slave trade.Buckingham Palace said Charles takes the issues \u201cprofoundly seriously\u201d and the royal household will help with the academic project by offering access to the Royal Collection and the Royal Archives.The coronation will take place on May 6 and heads of state, overseas government representatives, Government ministers, first ministers, former PMs, foreign royals and members of the royal family will be in attendance."
