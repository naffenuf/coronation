        "Regular viewers of the show will have to wait for the next instalment of the explosive soap - with a rescheduled date to be confirmed by BBC.Fans were left on edge as the last episode saw a bomb discovered in the ED after a patient arrived with unexploded grenades on him, resulting in a\u00a0hospital evacuation.\u00a0\u00a0The BBC's main channel will be all about Eurovision on Saturday - with coverage from 8pm until midnight.\u00a0The Eurovision Song Contest will make its long-awaited return next week, with the UK set to host for the final for the first time since 1997.",
        "Mae Muller is hoping to go one step better than last year's runner-up Sam Ryder as she represents the United Kingdom in the final on May 13.She was unveiled as the UK's entry in March with her own single I Wrote A Song after previously touring with Little Mix and performing on Jimmy Fallon.The UK was invited to host this year's Eurovision after last year's winners Ukraine were unable to present the event due to their ongoing conflict with Russia.In August 2022, a list narrowed down from 20 UK cities who initially submitted an 'expression of interest' was released by the BBC, with applicants across all four regions demonstrating how they would reflect Ukrainian culture, music and communities.",
        "Of the seven cities named in August, six were in England, one in Scotland, with Belfast failing to make the cut for Northern Ireland.The final list was then narrowed down to Glasgow and Liverpool, and in November, Eurovision bosses confirmed that Liverpool would host the contest.Both semi-finals and the final will take place at the 11,000-strong Liverpool Arena, with the city itself set to host a slew of special events throughout the event.Liverpool, which has been a UNESCO City of Music since 2015, is synonymous with The Beatles and has a rich music heritage.In February, a slew of big names were confirmed as part of the presenting line-up , with longtime commentator Graham Norton at the helm alongside Ukrainian singer and frontwoman of alternative band The HARDKISS, Julia Sanina.",
        "They will be joined in the Liverpool Arena by Ted Lasso star Hannah Waddingham and singer-songwriter Alesha Dixon.The BBC said Graham will be sharing the commentary box with comedic actress and former Great British Bake Off host Mel Giedroyc, who it is believed will help cover for him while he is on stage presenting.The BBC will once again present the UK's coverage of Eurovision, and for the first time in history, both of the semi-finals will be broadcast on BBC One.",
        "The final will also air on the same channel, and will be available to watch on BBC iPlayer."
