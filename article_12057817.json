You deserve real heroes in this world because you are real heroes to me. And I love you. Thank you. Thank you.'",
        "With writers on strike and picketing studios, host Drew Barrymore announced she was dropping out last Sunday.The 48-year-old actress-turned-talk show host had been set to MC the festivities, but she put her clout behind writers struggling to earn better pay and guarantees on staffing, as studios increasingly try to limit the size of writers' rooms and shrink the number of episodes per series.\u00a0\u00a0'I have listened to the writers, and in order to truly respect them, I will pivot from hosting the MTV Movie &amp; TV Awards live in solidarity with the strike,' Barrymore told Variety. 'Everything we celebrate and honor about movies and television is born out of their creation.'",
        "Barrymore added that she'll be watching the show from home, and she stills plans to return as host next year.\u00a0Despite her absence, the Hollywood stalwart was also named the Best Host for The Drew Barrymore Show.\u00a0Barrymore said as she was accepting the honors, \u2018Hello, hello. Thank you so much. I can't believe this. Thank you for letting me in. Get eyeball to eyeball. Thank you for this whole show. This whole world being - thank you. Thank you so much.She continued: \u2018Oh, my goodness. Okay. Also I want to thank Chelsey, Christina, Liz, our amazing, amazing writers.

        "The Kardashians were named Best Docu-reality Series over Jersey Shore Family Vacation, The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, Family Reunion: Love &amp; Hip Hop Edition and Vanderpump Rules.\u00a0In the category of Breakthrough Performance, Stranger Things star Joseph Quinn was crowned with the honor over fellow nominees Bad Bunny (Bullet Train), Bella Ramsey (The Last Of Us), Emma D\u2019Arcy (House of the Dragon), and Rachel Sennott (Bodies Bodies Bodies).\u00a0Vanderpump Rules quartet Ariana Madix, Katie Maloney, Scheana Shay and LaLa Kent was named Best Reality On-Screen Team, besting stars from shows such as Jersey Shore Family Vacation, The Challenge: Ride or Dies, RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race and The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.Adam Sandler took home the prize for Best Comedic Performance, besting fellow nominees Coolidge (Shotgun Wedding), Dylan O\u2019Brien (Not Okay), KeKe Palmer (Nope) and Quinta Brunson (Abbott Elementary).In the category for Best Fight, the Scream VI conflict between Ghostface and Courteney Cox (as Gale Weathers) prevailed of the nominees.RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race: All-Stars was crowned the Best Competition Series, besting competitors including All-Star Shore, Big Brother, The Challenge: USA and The Traitors.Outer Banks stars Madison Bailey and Rudy Pankow were crowned winners in the Best Kiss category, defeating competitors such as The Last Of Us' Anna Torv and Philip Prajoux, My Policeman's Harry Styles and David Dawson, Daisy Jones &amp; The Six's Riley Keough and Sam Claflin and Only Murders in the Building's Selena Gomez and Cara Delevingne.\u00a0",
        "The 2023 MTV Movie &amp; TV Awards aired Sunday in a pre-taped broadcast amid the commencement of the WGA writers' strike earlier this week.\u00a0\u00a0The long-running awards show was one of the first victims of the ongoing dispute between the\u00a0Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers and the Writers Guild of America union.Officials from the Writers Guild had pledged to picket at the event in Southern California - which will would have put celebrities in the awkward position of crossing the line - until MTV scuttled the live event Saturday evening.MTV executive producer Bruce Gillmer said in a statement, 'We're pivoting away from a live event,' according to the AP.Gillmer said that the pre-taped format enables the network 'to produce a memorable night full of exclusive sneak peaks, irreverent categories our audience has come to expect, and countless moments that will both surprise and delight.'As in previous years, the show will feature gender-neutral award categories.\u00a0The show, which had previously been split over two days for scripted and unscripted content, had been condensed back into a single evening this year.\u00a0Some fans were up in arms as the network aired a stripped-down version of its usual ceremony featuring little more than clip packages, a few pre-recorded sketches and a small number of stars accepting awards virtually.",
        "Many viewers on social media thought the show was little more than shell of its former self after it was swept up in ongoing contract disputes between the Writers Guild of America and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which represents film and TV production companies.The labor action also led the awards show to cancel its red carpet festivities, and other stars dropped out to show support to strikers - with the WGA picketing outside the Barker Hangar.\u00a0The most significant blow was Barrymore's decision to drop out as host in solidarity with writers after the strike began on Monday. Although she didn't not cross a picket line to appear in person, she was featured in several pre-taped sketches and commercials.Film and television writers are on strike over complaints that studios have underpaid them for years, particularly when it comes to streaming programs that offer almost no residuals over time.\u00a0They are also fighting back against studios' attempts to shrink writers's rooms, to shorten the number of episodes of television seasons and to leave open the possibility of replacing human writers with so-called 'AI' programs.'Worst award show ever,' wrote one person who reposted a funny video of a woman freaking out.'This has to be a joke. I do not believe this is happening. I'm literally about to f***ing kill myself and I'm not kidding,' screamed the woman in the video, which has become a popular meme. 'You better f***ing fix this s*** right now! I literally am gonna die, I need an ambulance.'Some people appeared to have not been paying attention to the battle between writers and studio bosses, as it has so far only impacted a few live shows.'Is this not a typical mtv movie awards lmao? I'm so lost,' wrote one confused person who included a photo of a woman grimacing.\u00a0",
        "Some users couldn't believe that MTV would move forward on a show that no longer had a host.\u00a0Barrymore appeared in a few disjointed videos, but many of them referenced her hosting the live show, which no longer made sense in context.\u00a0'Drew Barrymore didn't host the #MTVAwards but they are still playing her clips,' wrote one viewer.\u00a0For one Twitter user, the broadcast brought back back memories of the height of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, when most television productions had to resort to virtual appearances to keep performers safe.'Bruh watching the #MTVMovieandTVAwards and thanks to the Writers Strike goin on, watching it like this feels like we're in Covid era all over again,' tweeted one viewer.Another user agreed, writing, 'I thought awards shows were weird in 2020 with the lockdown and everyone doing them on zoom but this is definitely weird.'\u00a0Others pointed out the drastic changes in tone the broadcast suffered from due to its new format.'We went from Pedro [Pascal] give a heartwarming speech in his backyard to Tom Crusie in a f***ing plane [sic],' pointed out one person who included a screenshot of Cruise in his aircraft with his golden popcorn sitting behind him in the cockpit.",
