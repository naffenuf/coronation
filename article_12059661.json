        "Mansfield missed out on the League Two play-offs by the narrowest of margins despite winning 2-0 at Colchester.",
        "The Stags secured victory through goals from Riley Harbottle and James Gale at the end of each half but it was not enough to pip Salford to seventh place.Both Mansfield and Salford finished level on 75 points but the Ammies, who lost 1-0 at home to Gillingham, claimed a play-off berth courtesy of a better goal difference of just one.Colchester goalkeeper Tom Smith denied Davis Keillor-Dunn, Harbottle and Hiram Boateng while Alfie Kilgour\u2019s header flew just wide as Mansfield pushed hard for the breakthrough at the JobServe Community Stadium.It looks as though the teams would go into the break still locked at 0-0 but Town, beaten in last season\u2019s League Two play-off final, went ahead in first-half stoppage time.Harbottle headed home Keillor-Dunn\u2019s free-kick, which had been awarded after defender Tom Dallison had controversially been penalised for a foul on Will Swan midway inside the Colchester half.",
        "Boateng fired just wide for the Stags early in the second half as the visitors looked to build on that Harbottle goal while Keillor-Dunn\u2019s curled effort from the edge of the box bounced off the bar.Colchester then hit the woodwork themselves just before the hour when John Akinde\u2019s close-range effort struck the crossbar, after Christy Pym had done well to deny Connor Hall.",
        "Swan spurned a great chance to increase Mansfield\u2019s lead late on after firing wide and Kilgour blocked Freddie Sears\u2019 goalbound shot.Substitute Gale wrapped up Mansfield\u2019s victory in the seventh minute of stoppage time with a low finish from from Lucas Akins\u2019 pass, but it was too little too late for Nigel Clough\u2019s men as they just missed out on a play-off spot."
