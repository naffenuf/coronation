The 69-year-old was inducted into the Hall of Fame last September.Cincinnati and Xavier are both rivals in the same city and take part in the 'Crosstown Shootout' every year.Speaking on Bill Cunningham's radio show on WLW, Huggins referenced a time that Xavier fans '[threw] rubber penises on the floor and then [said] they didn't do it, by God they can get away with anything'.After the radio host joked that it must have been 'transgender night', Huggins then said, 'It was a Crosstown Shootout, yeah, no, what it was, was all those f**s, those Catholic f**s I think' before quipping that they threw those objects because 'they were envious they didn't have one.'",

        "'I deeply apologize to the individuals I have offended, as well as to the Xavier University community, the University of Cincinnati, and West Virginia University.'As I have shared with my players over 40 years of coaching, there are consequences for our words and actions, and I will fully accept any coming my way.'I am ashamed and embarrassed and heartbroken for those I have hurt. I must do better, and I will.'Huggins has the most wins in Cincinnati men's basketball history with 399 over a 16 year tenure. He then went on to coach one season at Kansas State before taking the job with his alma mater West Virginia in 2008."
