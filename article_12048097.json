        "UK Athletics have decided to shut their base at the Alexander Stadium\u00a0The move could save them \u00a3100,000 after posted losses of \u00a31.8m in last yearThe governing body have not been able to pay key coaches for months\u00a0UK Athletics will close their head office in Birmingham this summer in a desperate bid to save money.",
        "Mail Sport revealed last month that the cash-strapped governing body have not been able to pay key coaches for months and could be forced to lay-off as many as 10 members of staff.With the threat of bankruptcy now also looming, UKA have decided to take the drastic measure of shutting their base at the Alexander Stadium, which could save them \u00a3100,000 a year in rent.Staff will instead be asked to work from home with the organisation confirming they are moving to a \u2018virtual office structure\u2019.UKA posted losses of \u00a31.8million in the last financial year, with reserves down from \u00a32.2m to a worrying \u00a3430,000.\u00a0",
        "Chief executive Jack Buckner told Mail Sport in February that the \u2018state of the organisation definitely gives me sleepless nights\u2019 \u2014 and he is now taking extreme action to bring about cost savings.UKA said in a statement: \u2018We can confirm that UK Athletics will be leaving its head office this summer.\u2018With a significant reduction in the size of workforce since 2020, and an increase in the number of staff working remotely following the pandemic, the size and cost of the tenancy is no longer justifiable.\u2018While we are working on a number of alternative workspace solutions for a small number of personnel, and may secure a smaller office tenancy in future, in the immediate future UKA head office staff will move to a more sustainable virtual office structure.\u2019"
