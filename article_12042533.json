'And I'm telling him, pushing him off saying \"what are you doing?\"",
        "'Then he proceeded to do it two more times where the last time I was pushing him off and I can see on the cameras that somebody was outside the office door and I was yelling for them to come help because he's big and massive.'\"It's disgusting,\" Vaughn reportedly said to Mahomes at the time. 'Like you're a child and he was trying to say \"we should be a power couple,\" and I'm like \"clearly you're out of your mind right now.'''A lawyer for Mahomes, Brandan Davies denied the allegations at the time.'Jackson has done nothing wrong,' the attorney told the outlet. 'Our investigation has revealed substantial evidence refuting the claims of Jackson's accuser including the statements of several witnesses.'We have reached out to law enforcement to provide the fruit of our investigation so that they may have a complete picture of the matter.'",

        "He was called out on social media and he apologized for the incident on Twitter, writing, 'I want to sincerely apologize for accidentally being on the Sean Taylor #21 at FedEx Field. We were directed to stand in that area and I meant absolutely no\u00a0disrespect to him or his family.'In addition, he was accused of shoving a 19-year-old male waiter on several occasions.The teenage waiter, who chose to remain unnamed, said Mahomes would not let access the staff office.\u00a0'I was going into our office downstairs where the employees are in the employee area, and he's downstairs for I don't know what reason,' the waiter said.'I'm trying to get to the office, and he's like, pushing me out. \u2026 And he's like, 'No, get out, get out.''Mahomes quietly made a return to social media\u00a0last week almost two months after being accused of assault and sexual assault.",
        "Jackson,\u00a0a big following on TikTok and Instagram, had been unusually quiet across social media platforms in the weeks following the allegations but began posting again last week.\u00a0Last Wednesday, he posted on his Instagram story appearing to be mingling with NFL fans who came into Kansas City for the NFL Draft.He also made his first TikTok in about two months as he lip-synced the lyrics, 'I've been losing friends and finding peace.'",
