        "She also revealed that around 192 microphones in various different places will capture the recording for four hours \u2013 featuring performances from eight choirs, six conductors, two organists, as well as a specially selected \u201cCoronation Orchestra\u201d, among others.",
        "Barry added: \u201cWe\u2019ve been here learning the event, in the rehearsals so hopefully we won\u2019t be surprised by anything, suddenly coming from somewhere we didn\u2019t think it was going to come from, but there are so many participants as well, it\u2019s wonderfully inclusive.\u201dPhysical versions of the album, featuring the entire service and all new commissions, will be available in stores globally from May 15, with a special deluxe collector\u2019s CD and vinyl following later in the year.It will be exclusively recorded at Westminster Abbey and released by Decca Records, with an official photograph from the day as the cover art.The ceremony is set to feature a range of musical styles and performers, blending tradition, heritage and ceremony with the new musical voices of today to reflect Charles\u2019 life-long support of music and the arts.The Coronation Of Their Majesties King Charles III And Queen Camilla: The Official Album Of The Coronation will be released in support of the Royal British Legion and Age UK charities."
