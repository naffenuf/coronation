        "Olympic gold medallist Oliver Townend has made a strong start to his quest for a first Badminton Horse Trials title since 2009.",
        "The Shropshire-based Yorkshireman leads after day one of dressage, guiding Swallow Springs to a score of 23.2 penalties from an early morning draw.Townend, a member of Great Britain\u2019s eventing team that won gold at the Tokyo Games, holds a narrow lead over Gemma Stevens and Jalapeno, with world number one \u2013 New Zealander Tim Price \u2013 lying third on Vitali.",
        "Townend\u2019s Tokyo ride Ballaghmor Class is among a raft of Badminton contenders in dressage action on Saturday, when his Olympic team-mates Tom McEwen, riding Toledo De Kerser, and Laura Collett with Dacapo will also enter the arena.And there is also likely to be a strong challenge launched by 2018 world champion Ros Canter, who returns aboard last year\u2019s Badminton runner-up Lordships Graffalo in pursuit of a \u00a3105,000 top prize.Sunday\u2019s demanding cross-country test will be pivotal to the final outcome before the concluding showjumping phase on Monday.",
        "\u201cThat was a very good start to the week,\u201d said Townend, who was third on Swallow Springs at Badminton 12 months ago.\u201cI have two older horses here and I don\u2019t think they have ever felt better, which is a great tribute to my team at home.\u201cI am very happy with the draw for Swallow Springs and think it will suit him. He is the quickest event horse I have ever sat on.\u201d"
