        "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has said there is \u201cnothing to be served\u201d by the ongoing incarceration of Julian Assange as he expressed frustration at the United States\u2019 continuing efforts to extradite the WikiLeaks founder and Australian citizen.",
        "Mr Albanese\u2019s comments on Friday in an Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) interview appeared to escalate diplomatic pressure on the United States to drop the charges against the 51-year-old, who has spent four years in Britain\u2019s Belmarsh Prison fighting extradition to the US.Before that, Mr Assange had taken asylum for seven years in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London.Mr Albanese said Mr Assange\u2019s case had to be examined in terms of whether the time Mr Assange had \u201ceffectively served\u201d was in excess of what would be \u201creasonable\u201d if the allegations against him were proved.",
        "\u201cI just say that enough is enough. There is nothing to be served by his ongoing incarceration,\u201d Mr Albanese said.\u201cI know it\u2019s frustrating, I share the frustration. I can\u2019t do more than make very clear what my position is and the US administration is certainly very aware of what the Australian government\u2019s position is.\u201dMr Assange has battled in British courts for years to avoid being sent to the US, where he faces 17 charges of espionage and one charge of computer misuse that stem from WikiLeaks\u2019 publication of a huge trove of classified documents in 2010.American prosecutors allege he helped US Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning steal classified diplomatic cables and military files that WikiLeaks later published, putting lives at risk.",
        "To his supporters, Mr Assange is a secrecy-busting journalist who exposed US military wrongdoing in Iraq and Afghanistan.Mr Albanese said there was a \u201cdisconnect\u201d between the US treatment of Mr Assange and Ms Manning.Then-US president Barack Obama commuted Ms Manning\u2019s 35-year sentence to seven years, which allowed her release in 2017.",
        "Mr Albanese said he has advocated for Mr Assange in meetings with US administration officials.On Friday, he declined to say whether he would raise Mr Assange with US President Joe Biden when Mr Albanese hosts the US leader along with leaders of India and Japan in Sydney on May 24.\u201cThe way that diplomacy works\u2026 is probably not to forecast the discussions that you will have, or have had with leaders of other nations,\u201d he said.\u201cI\u2019ll engage diplomatically in order to achieve an outcome.\u201dMr Albanese said he did not want to get into an argument about whether Mr Assange\u2019s alleged actions were right or wrong.Mr Albanese noted a British district court decision, since overturned, that rejected the extradition request on the grounds that Mr Assange was likely to kill himself if held under harsh US prison conditions.\u201cI am concerned about Mr Assange\u2019s mental health,\u201d Mr Albanese said.\u201cThere was a court decision here in the United Kingdom that was overturned on appeal that went to Mr Assange\u2019s health as well and I am concerned for him.\u201d"
