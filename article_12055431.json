        "One of the top basketball prospects in the country, who is coincidentally the son of LeBron James, offered an end to his recruitment, as Bronny James announced his commitment to Southern California on Saturday.",
        "On his Instagram page, the younger James announced merely, \"Fight On #committed.\"James, a 6-3 combo guard, picked to stay near home at USC over interest from several other top programs, including official offers from Memphis and Ohio State.A five-star prospect according to On3, James is also a composite five star per calculations from 247, though the later service ranks him a four star in their own evaluation. Regardless, he ranks among the top 30 players in the country in most every service.On3, which also ranks prospects according to NIL value, puts the Sierra Canyon School (Chatsworth, Calif.) product as the most valuable high school athlete in the country with an estimated valuation of $7.4 million.His recent March performance in the McDonald's All-American game may have improved his stock even further, as he scored 15 points on a game-high five 3-pointers.Also in March, an NBA scout raved about James to On3, saying, \"Bronny won't get drafted because he's LeBron's kid. He'll get drafted because he's an NBA player.\"--Field Level Media"
