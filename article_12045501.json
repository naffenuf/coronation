        "The post-season clear-out at Melbourne Victory is underway, with two of Tony Popovic's assistants and the goalkeeping coach departing the A-League Men club.",
        "Victory finished 11th in a dire second season for Popovic, having made the semi-final after finishing second on the table in the head coach's first campaign.The club appears willing to back Popovic as he heads into the third year of a hefty deal but his coaching panel will be overhauled.\"Melbourne Victory can confirm A-League Men's assistant coaches, Fabrizio Cammarata, Luciano Trani and goalkeeper coach, Peter Zois will not continue with the club's senior men's team into the 2023-24 season,\" the club said in a statement.\"The group joined the club at the beginning of the 2021-22 A-League Men's season, playing a significant part in Victory's Australia Cup success in 2022.\"Goalkeeper Matt Acton, attacker Lleyton Brooks, full-back Kike Lopez (Kadete) and striker Tomi Juric have also made way.Back-up goalkeeper Acton departs after 40 games in seven seasons.Former Socceroos striker Juric proved a bust amid another torrid injury run, playing just 47 minutes across six games for one goal.Brooks, 23, scored three goals in 31 appearances, largely off the bench, while Spaniard Kadete departs after one season."
