        "Manchester United loanee Shola Shoretire was praised by Bolton manager Ian Evatt after his first senior goal ensured the Trotters warmed up for the Sky Bet League One play-offs on a high.",
        "The 19-year-old opened his senior goalscoring account to put Bolton on course for a hard-fought 3-2 victory over Bristol Rovers at the Memorial Stadium and ensured they will face Barnsley in their play-off semi-final in confident mood.Evatt said: \u201cI think that Shola is a hugely talented player and while I\u2019m delighted that he\u2019s now got off the mark with us, I\u2019m certain that there\u2019s lots more to come.\u201cHe\u2019s had a bit of a stop-start of things since he came to Bolton but scoring his first senior goal for us will be a great boost for him.\u201cThis is his first loan away from United and his first sustained taste of senior football and as a young player you\u2019re always going to have highs and lows.\u201cHe started off great with us after arriving on loan in January and then he\u2019s had a dip but the key thing is that he has kept his head down and worked hard and he can have an impact in the play-offs.\u201d",
        "Shoretire put Bolton in command with a tap-in midway through the first half and although Luca Hoole equalised soon after, Bolton\u2019s superiority told after the break.After Shoretire limped off with cramp, Southampton loanee Daniel Nlundulu restored Bolton\u2019s advantage with a 20-yard drive before Aaron Morley struck with a delightful side-footed effort from outside the box.",
        "Rovers substitute John Marquis slotted home from close range late on to set up a tense finale that saw Scott Sinclair\u2019s stoppage-time strike hit the crossbar but Bolton held firm, much to Evatt\u2019s delight.\u201cThe squad is in a good place, the players have lots of confidence and I have a massive amount of belief in them,\u201d Evatt added.\u201cWe have to prove what we can do in the play-offs but now I feel we\u2019re coming to the boil at just the right time.\u201cWe have the hunger and determination to attack the play-offs and we\u2019ve been working tirelessly behind the scenes, so we\u2019ll be ready.\u201cBut now isn\u2019t the time for pats on the back, it\u2019s about getting our heads down and working hard because we can do it in the play-offs if we give it our best shot.\u201dAfter taking part in a post-match lap of honour with his players and staff, Rovers boss Joey Barton was quick to look forward to next season.\u201cI\u2019ll be aiming to build a squad that is capable of challenging for a place in the Championship because that\u2019s what the fans deserve,\u201d Barton said.\u201cThe support we\u2019ve received from the Gasheads has been sensational but special mention must go to my players who have worked ever so hard all season.",
        "\u201cI know the enormous sacrifices that they have made this season to help establish ourselves in League One.\u201d"
