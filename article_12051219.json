        "Elisabeth, who is studying History and Politics at Oxford University, put on an elegant display in a navy midi dress as she stepped out at the occasion in London, alongside her father King Philippe of Belgium.Cinched at the waist with a dainty black belt, the 21-year-old teamed her long sleeved dress with matching high heels.The future Queen - who will ascend the throne after her father - added a touch of glitz to her look with dazzling diamond drop earrings and a coordinating silver bag when attending the event hosted by King Charles on the\u00a0eve of his coronation.Also arriving at the reception - hosted by the British monarch for foreign royalty and other overseas dignitaries - was\u00a0Catharina-Amalia of the Netherlands, who is heir to the Dutch throne.",

She will become the country's first Queen Regent if she takes up the role.",
        "Elisabeth spent 18 months boarding at UWC Atlantic College in South Wales before returning home to Brussels in March ahead of the government lockdown.The princess, who received her International Baccalaureate Diploma in 2020, enrolled at Oxford University after completing a one-year course in social and military sciences at the Royal Military Academy.The course is said to teach in-depth about the four components of Belgian defence; Army, Air Force, Navy and Medical.King Philippe, 60, spent three years at the esteemed institution between 1978 to 1981.",
        "Last month, the Crown Princess of Belgium called the late British Queen her 'role model' as she represented her parents King Philippe and Queen Mathilde in signing a book of condolence in Brussels.Princess Elisabeth signed the book of condolences at the residence of the UK ambassador, and wrote a sweet note praise the late Monarch's 'exemplarity'.The Belgian royal appeared deep in thought in pictures shared by the royal household on Instagram.'Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II has been a role model and a source of inspiration for many of us, young and old,' the Princess wrote in her note.'I join the millions around the world in mourning an extraordinary personality, whose exemplarity has had a profound impact on younger generations. May her soul rest in peace.",
        "'On behalf of King Philippe and Queen Mathilde, I wish to express our deepest condolences to the Royal Family and the people of the United Kingdom, the Realms and the Commonwealth.'",
        "Elisabeth dedicated the note 'in loving memory of her majesty Queen Elizabeth II.' and signed her name.\u00a0Meanwhile, in February, the Dutch Crown Princess\u00a0Catharina-Amalia opened up about 'missing normal life' after she was forced to leave university accommodation over a gangster plot to kidnap her.The teenager, who started a degree in politics, psychology, law and economics at the University of Amsterdam last year, moved out of her student accommodation and returned to her home in The Hague in October.\u00a0At the time, several Dutch media outlets reported that the princess, whose formal title is Princess of Orange, was under heightened security due to fears that criminal gangs may target her for kidnapping or an attack.\u00a0During her tour of the Caribbean earlier this year, the royal briefly touched on her heightened security, and in a clip shared by Dutch media site NOS, said: 'I'm going to be very honest, I'm still having a very hard time.",

        "'The consequences are very difficult for her. There is no student life for her like others have,' she added with an unusual amount of emotional candour.\u00a0The name of the princess, along with Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, are understood to have come up in communications among organised crime groups which indicated they may be in their crosshairs for kidnapping.'I'm very sorry for her and I'm obviously very concerned about it,' the Prime Minister said, without divulging details about the threats or the security measures.\u00a0'That makes people angry who want to be informed,' said the Prime Minister.\u00a0He added that Dutch authorities are doing everything to ensure that the princess is safe.\u00a0Princess Amalia started her degree in September and was living in rented accommodation she shared with several other students in Amsterdam before she had to move back home.The princess is viewed in Holland as a relatively down-to-earth royal. She is a keen jockey with a horse named Mojito and she was nicknamed the Cocktail Queen after working a summer at a beach bar in Scheveningen.\u00a0She recently took part in her first international tour, joining her parents on a lengthy visit to the\u00a0Dutch Caribbean Islands.",

        "But the monarch looked shocked by the heavy rain as he passed thousands of people who are camped out along the route from the Abbey to the Palace including the packed Mall, dubbed\u00a0Chaztonbury due to the huge numbers camped out there.Meanwhile Prince Harry may have already landed in the UK for his 24-hour visit for the Coronation - leaving his wife and two children at home.The Duke of Sussex is intending to fly back to California straight after the historic ceremony ends tomorrow afternoon so he can make it back to see Archie on his fourth birthday.This morning a private jet from Van Nuys airport in California landed at Farnborough, the airport closest to Windsor Castle.
