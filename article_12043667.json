        "Sam Allardyce has been drafted in by a desperate Leeds to secure their survivalThe ex-Bolton and England boss will be paid \u00a3500,000 for four games\u00a0His first press conference was like he had never been away as he rolled the hitsHe issued a fine for a phone going off, took aim at the judiciary, revealed he nearly died from Covid and claimed he was as good as Pep Guardiola. Yes, Big Sam is back \u2013 and it is as if he has never been away.",
        "\u2018Two seconds\u2019 was all Sam Allardyce said it took for him to accept Leeds United\u2019s offer to return to management after two years out of the game. No wonder, really, given he could bank \u00a33million if he pulls off what he admits would be the greatest of all his great escapes.Such was his excitement about being back in the big time, Allardyce conducted a live radio interview from his new office at Leeds\u2019 Thorp Arch training ground even before his appointment \u2013 and the sacking of Javi Gracia - had been confirmed by the club.That announcement finally came at 10.30am and, following his first training session, he was in front of the TV cameras by 4pm. There, Allardyce was in his element, holding court for almost 45 minutes, three times the length of his predecessor\u2019s rather more mundane media addresses.",
        "\u2018We start with an easy one on Saturday,\u2019 grinned the 68-year-old. \u2018You can\u2019t really get any easier, can you?\u2019 That \u2018easy\u2019 fixture is at champions Manchester City. Then, he takes on two of his former clubs, Newcastle at home and West Ham away, before Tottenham visit on the final day of the season.\u2018To try and save this club and keep it in the Premier League is a big responsibility and a big challenge but one I was prepared to take because of who Leeds United are,\u2019 said Allardyce, whose side are only out of the relegation zone on goal difference and have not won in five games.",
        "\u2018It is probably my biggest challenge because of the shortness of games that are left. From the great escape point of view, it would be the greatest, because it is only four games.\u2018We have to pull off a surprise win from somewhere. I don\u2019t think anybody outside of Leeds expects us to win any of these four games. Hopefully we can shock a few people in the Premier League.\u2019Allardyce, though, would have liked longer. When Jesse Marsch was sacked in February, it is understood he offered his services to Leeds chief executive Angus Kinnear \u2013 who he worked with at West Ham. But his advances were ignored, with Victor Orta \u2013 the club\u2019s then director of football who was sacked on Tuesday \u2013 scouring the continent and somehow ending up at Gracia\u2019s door.\u2018In the highlight of this year when they've had their troubles, they've always known where I am,\u2019 said Allardyce. \u2018The football club chooses which way it wants to go and far too many people think I'm old and antiquated, which is so far from the truth. I might be 68 and look old but there's nobody ahead of me in football terms. Not Pep, not (Jurgen) Klopp, not (Mikel) Arteta.\u2019It was quite a claim but Allardyce knew exactly what he was doing. \u2018I\u2019ve just given you a big headline,\u2019 he later said with a twinkle in his eye. \u2018I can see it tomorrow \u2013 that will be wonderful.\u2019",
        "Allardyce, though, does genuinely believe he has what it takes to stop the Whites from sinking \u2013 firstly by shoring up a defence which conceded a Premier League record 23 goals last month.\u2018The first thing that we\u2019re going to have to do is to stop that if we\u2019re going to get out of trouble,\u2019 he said. And that could include dropping goalkeeper Illan Meslier, whose form and confidence has plummeted in recent weeks.\u2018We will have a conversation,\u2019 said Allardyce. \u2018Unfortunately, he's made mistakes and they\u2019ve cost a couple of goals right at the wrong time. We will make that decision on Friday.\u2019",
        "Assisting Allardyce at Leeds will be Karl Robinson, who was sacked by League One Oxford in February, after his usual sidekick Sammy Lee was ruled out because he is on jury service. \u2018The judge has left Sammy unemployed and I find that to be very poor judgement indeed,\u2019 said Allardyce in an unexpected swipe.Robbie Keane, who played for Leeds two decades ago, has also joined his coaching staff. \u2018Robbie got a call this morning and came from Ireland by 2pm this afternoon with his bag packed,\u2019 smiled Allardyce. \u2018Everything had to move very quickly. I have never moved as quickly in my entire life over a position. I have missed a Covid injection to be here today.\u2019",
        "Talk of Covid then led to one final Allardyce anecdote. \u2018Before Covid had come into this country, I must have caught it in Dubai and I was violently ill for about four weeks,\u2019 he revealed. \u2018The doctors didn\u2019t know what was wrong with me and no antibiotic worked. I thought I was in big trouble.\u2019Big Sam survived that episode \u2013 now can he save Leeds?"
