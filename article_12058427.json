        "READ MORE: Jennifer Coolidge leads winners at MTV Awards 2023\u00a0Fans were up in arms on Sunday after the 2023 MTV Movie &amp; TV Awards aired a stripped-down version of its usual ceremony featuring little more than clip packages, a few pre-recorded sketches and a small number of stars accepting awards virtually.",
        "Many viewers on social media thought the show was little more than shell of its former self after it was swept up in ongoing contract disputes between the Writers Guild of America and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which represents film and TV production companies.The most significant blow was Drew Barrymore's decision to drop out as host in solidarity with writers after the strike began on Monday. Although she didn't not cross a picket line to appear in person, she was featured in several pre-taped sketches and commercials.Film and television writers are on strike over complaints that studios have underpaid them for years, particularly when it comes to streaming programs that offer almost no residuals over time. They are also fighting back against studios' attempts to shrink writers's rooms, to shorten the number of episodes of television seasons and to leave open the possibility of replacing human writers with so-called 'AI' programs.'Worst award show ever,' wrote one person who reposted a funny video of a woman freaking out.",

        "'This has to be a joke. I do not believe this is happening. I'm literally about to f***ing kill myself and I'm not kidding,' screamed the woman in the video, which has become a popular meme. 'You better f***ing fix this s*** right now! I literally am gonna die, I need an ambulance.'Some people appeared to have not been paying attention to the battle between writers and studio bosses, as it has so far only impacted a few live shows.'Is this not a typical mtv movie awards lmao? I'm so lost,' wrote one confused person who included a photo of a woman grimacing.\u00a0Some users couldn't believe that MTV would move forward on a show that no longer had a host.Barrymore appeared in a few disjointed videos, but many of them referenced her hosting the live show, which no longer made sense in context.\u00a0'Drew Barrymore didn't host the #MTVAwards but they are still playing her clips,' wrote one viewer.\u00a0For one Twitter user, the broadcast brought back back memories of the height of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, when most television productions had to resort to virtual appearances to keep performers safe.'Bruh watching the #MTVMovieandTVAwards and thanks to the Writers Strike goin on, watching it like this feels like we're in Covid era all over again,' tweeted one viewer.",
        "Another user agreed, writing, 'I thought awards shows were weird in 2020 with the lockdown and everyone doing them on zoom but this is definitely weird.'\u00a0Others pointed out the drastic changes in tone the broadcast suffered from due to its new format.'We went from Pedro [Pascal] give a heatwarming speech in his backyard to Tom Crusie in a f***ing plane [sic],' pointed out one person who included a screenshot of Cruise in his aircraft with his golden popcorn sitting behind him in the cockpit.\u00a0It appeared that many fans who were aware of the format change didn't have high expectations for MTV's show.'About to press play on the nightmare that is the mtv awards,' groaned one person on Twitter.Another user showed solidarity with striking writers proclaimed that it was a mistake to go on with the show.'Should've just cancelled this year. Desperately need writers,' tweeted a fan who also tagged the WGA.But it wasn't all bad news for MTV. Some users found Barrymore's occasional performances to be so charming that she helped lift up the show.",
        "'Didn't know Drew Barrymore was so funny, as MTV awards host,' wrote one user.They referenced a clip of Barrymore \u2014 as her Never Been Kissed character \u2014 being transported to the world of Greta Gerwig's upcoming Barbie movie starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling.",
        "'The way she just said about Ken/Barbie \"they're talking about f***ing right' \ud83d\ude1c,' they added approvingly.Despite the drastic change for the show, plenty of people also chimed in to complain about snubbed nominees including Florence Pugh and Bella Ramsey.Jennifer Coolidge showed her support for the Writers Guild of America amid the ongoing writers strike while accepting the Comedic Genius award, while Drew Barrymore \u2014 who dropped out as presenter due to the strike \u2014 was still honored with a Best Host award, and The Last of Us came away with three large honors.\u00a0Other notable names who emerged victorious on the evening \u2014 which drew some criticism from fans amid the pre-recorded broadcast as result of the WGA strike \u2014 included Tom Cruise, Jenna Ortega and Taylor Swift.\u00a0'Almost all great comedy starts with great writers,' The White Lotus star said in her speech. 'I just think as a proud member of SAG, I stand here before you tonight side-by-side with my sisters and brothers from the WGA that are fighting right now, fighting for the rights of artists everywhere.She added, 'I think of the words of Shakespeare where he once said, you know, the play is the thing. Well, I don't want to put words in his mouth or anything but I think what he really meant was it's everything!'",
        "Coolidge won a second award for Most Frightened Performance for The White Lotus at the event. She prevailed in the category against Cocaine Bear's Jesse Tyler Ferguson, Barbarian's Justin Long, Bodies Bodies Bodies star Rachel Sennott and Smile's Sosie Bacon.\u00a0",
        "The Last Of Us star Pedro Pascal won the honor for Best Hero to kick off the award announcements, and the show also garnered honors for Best Show and Best Duo for Pascal and his costar Bella Ramsey.Pascal prevailed over a field including Andor's Diego Luna, Wednesday's Jenna Ortega, Ant-Man &amp; The Wasp: Quantumania's Paul Rudd and Top Gun: Maverick's Tom Cruise for the awards.Cruise was named the winner for Best Performance in a Movie for Top Gun: Maverick, besting fellow nominees Austin Butler (Elvis), Florence Pugh (Don\u2019t Worry Darling), KeKe Palmer (Nope) and Michael B. Jordan (Creed III).Cruise showed off his trademark showmanship as he delivered his acceptance speech from the air in a jet.Scream VI was named the Best Movie of the Year, edging ahead of a field that included Avatar: The Way of Water, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, Elvis, Nope, Smile and Top Gun: Maverick.Wednesday's Jenna Ortega was named the winner of Best Performance in a Show, besting a loaded category that consisted of Aubrey Plaza (The White Lotus), Christina Ricci (Yellowjackets), Riley Keough (Daisy Jones &amp; The Six), Sadie Sink (Stranger Things) and Selena Gomez (Only Murders in the Building).",
        "The Kardashians was named Best Docu-reality Series over Jersey Shore Family Vacation, The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, Family Reunion: Love &amp; Hip Hop Edition and Vanderpump Rules.In the category of Breakthrough Performance, Stranger Things star Joseph Quinn was crowned with the honor over fellow nominees Bad Bunny (Bullet Train), Bella Ramsey (The Last Of Us), Emma D\u2019Arcy (House of the Dragon) and Rachel Sennott (Bodies Bodies Bodies).Vanderpump Rules quartet Ariana Madix, Katie Maloney, Scheana Shay and LaLa Kent was named Best Reality On-Screen Team, besting stars from shows such as Jersey Shore Family Vacation, The Challenge: Ride or Dies, RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race and The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.Adam Sandler took home the prize for Best Comedic Performance, besting fellow nominees Coolidge (Shotgun Wedding), Dylan O\u2019Brien (Not Okay), KeKe Palmer (Nope) and Quinta Brunson (Abbott Elementary).In the category for Best Fight, the Scream VI conflict between Ghostface and Courteney Cox (as Gale Weathers) prevailed over the other nominees.RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race: All-Stars was crowned the Best Competition Series, besting competitors including All-Star Shore, Big Brother, The Challenge: USA and The Traitors.Outer Banks stars Madison Bailey and Rudy Pankow were were the winners in the Best Kiss category, defeating competitors such as The Last Of Us' Anna Torv and Philip Prajoux, My Policeman's Harry Styles and David Dawson, Daisy Jones &amp; The Six's Riley Keough and Sam Claflin and Only Murders in the Building's Selena Gomez and Cara Delevingne.The long-running awards show is one of the first victims of the ongoing dispute between the\u00a0Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers and the Writers Guild of America union.Writers are now on strike and picketing studios, leading Barrymore to announce she was dropping out last Sunday.'I have listened to the writers, and in order to truly respect them, I will pivot from hosting the MTV Movie &amp; TV Awards live in solidarity with the strike,' Barrymore told Variety. 'Everything we celebrate and honor about movies and television is born out of their creation.'Barrymore added that she'll be watching the show from home, and she stills plans to return as host next year.\u00a0The labor action also led the awards show to cancel its red carpet festivities, and other stars dropped out to show support to strikers.On Thursday, Vanderpump Rules star Lala Kent also announced she was no longer attending as a show of solidarity.'Although Vanderpump Rules falls under the unscripted sector of TV, that is not an excuse for me to remain silent and carry on as if there isn\u2019t so much at stake for every writer and their families,' she told The Hollywood Reporter\u00a0in a statement. 'We have to protect our creators and I hope you\u2019ll stand with me and many others as we do so until we reach a resolution (hopefully very soon).'The original list of presenters included recent Oscar winner Jamie Lee Curtis, Gal Gadot, Tiffany Haddish, Sarah Michelle Gellar and Lil Dicky's Dave Burd, along with several stars from Yellowjackets, Transformers: Rise Of The Beats and Joy Ride, including Oscar nominee Stephanie Hsu.Riley Keough, Ayo Edebiri, Kaia Gerber, Bodies Bodies Bodies star Rachel Sennott, Camila Morrone, Suki Waterhouse and The Little Mermaid's Halle Bailey were also set to appear, but the final show featured mostly vintage clips from years past.\u00a0Top Gun: Maverick and the shows Stranger Things and The Last Of Us scored the most nominations of any films and series.",
