        "Bournemouth boss Gary O\u2019Neil remains hopeful Marcus Tavernier will play again this season but vowed not to take risks with the injured winger.",
        "Tavernier sustained his third hamstring issue of the campaign shortly after scoring the winner in last week\u2019s 1-0 success at local rivals Southampton.The 24-year-old subsequently sat out Sunday\u2019s 4-1 thrashing of Leeds and has been ruled out of the Vitality Stadium clash with Chelsea.With Premier League survival almost certainly assured, O\u2019Neil is under no pressure to rush back Tavernier and admits his main focus is on ensuring the player is fit and firing in time for the start of pre-season training.\u201cWe\u2019re still not clear on exactly how long it would be,\u201d the Cherries manager said of the injury.\u201cEven if we were scrapping for points and desperate to stay in the Premier League, I\u2019m still not sure. We haven\u2019t had enough of the information back to let you know exactly when it would be.",
        "\u201cBut, of course, now that the situation has changed, there will be no rush.\u201cIf it\u2019s three weeks that he should be out and we need to take four, we\u2019ll take four. Whereas before it was like \u2018right, it\u2019s three weeks, let\u2019s get him back for this game, let\u2019s see if he can have an impact again\u2019. Obviously that has changed.\u201cMy real focus at this moment with Tav is to make sure he is absolutely spot on by July 1 and we can get a real, good pre-season into him.",
        "\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019ve seen the end of him this season. It might be that it\u2019s a couple of weeks and he\u2019s feeling fantastic and we\u2019ll see him back on the pitch.\u201dBournemouth sit level on 39 points with Frank Lampard\u2019s Blues ahead of their penultimate home fixture this term.Striker Kieffer Moore will join Tavernier on the sidelines due to concussion, while midfielder Hamed Traore will sit out a sixth successive game with a contact injury.While there is seemingly little left to play for, O\u2019Neil is eager for his side to continue the fine form which has brought six wins from nine games.\u201cThere are still a lot of points available to us and, of course, as the head coach of the team, I\u2019m desperate to put as many points on the board as possible regardless of the situation,\u201d he said.\u201cWe really want to finish the season strong and then take that into the summer break with us.\u201d"
