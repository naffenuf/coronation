        "MOSCOW, May 5 (Reuters) - Russia's finance ministry said it would levy a 20% contribution to the federal budget on sales of OFZ treasury bonds and holdings in Russian companies previously purchased from foreign investors.Foreign investors from so-called \"unfriendly\" countries - those that have imposed sanctions against Moscow - have been offloading billions of roubles worth of local debt holdings, selling the government's OFZ bonds at a steep discount, two financial market sources told Reuters in January.Moscow imposed restrictions on foreigners' holdings in response to sweeping Western sanctions over its actions in Ukraine, leaving many non-resident investors unable to sell or receive interest payments on certain assets.According to a note published on the Finance Ministry's website late on Thursday, the government commission that monitors foreign investment said transactions involving Russian companies' securities, OFZ bonds and corporate debt would be affected.It cast the requirement as both voluntary and obligatory.\"...the obligation to voluntarily direct funds in the amount of 20% of the Russian securities' nominal value to the federal budget,\" the note said.The decision was made on April 24, the note said.
