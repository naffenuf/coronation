        "On Friday, Letby, 33, entered the witness box at Manchester Crown Court to give her second day of evidence.She is on trial accused of the murders of seven babies and the attempted murders of 10 others at the Countess of Chester Hospital.The prosecution says she targeted the infants who were treated on the hospital\u2019s neonatal unit on various dates between June 2015 and June 2016.Her barrister, Ben Myers KC, turned to the first individual allegation against her, that she murdered a prematurely born twin boy shortly after a night shift started on June 8. You never forget something like that  Lucy Letby  Asked how she felt after the death of Child A, Letby said: \u201cStunned. It was a complete shock to all of us.",
        "\u201cI felt like we had walked through the doors into this awful situation. The first time I had met (Child A), the first time I had met his parents.\u201cIt was a huge shock.\u201dMr Myers said: \u201cIt is alleged of course that you did this \u2013 did you?\u201dLetby said: \u201cNo.Mr Myers said: \u201cWhat\u2019s it like to have that allegation made?\u201dLetby said: \u201cIt\u2019s awful. That day I was not even supposed to be working that night.\u201cIt was just a shock to walk into that situation.\u201d",
        "Asked if it had had a lasting impact, she replied: \u201cYou never forget something like that.\u201dThe Crown says Letby intravenously introduced air into the bloodstream of Child A. I recognised (Child A) to be jittery when I did my observations. It\u2019s an abnormal finding. That is not something you want a baby to be displaying  Lucy Letby  Letby recalled that she assisted a colleague with giving fluids to Child A through an intravenous line.Her workmate left nursery one to write notes up on a computer, she said, as she made standard equipment checks.Mr Myers said: \u201cWhat was the first indication you had that anything might not be right?\u201dLetby said: \u201cI recognised (Child A) to be jittery when I did my observations. It\u2019s an abnormal finding. That is not something you want a baby to be displaying.\u201dMr Myers asked: \u201cWhat happened next?\u201dLetby said: \u201cWhen I was carrying out my equipment checks around the bedside (Child A\u2019s) monitor sounded. That\u2019s when we noted his colour had changed and he was apnoeic.\u201dShe said his hands and feet were white as attempts were made to assist his breathing.Mr Myers asked: \u201cDo you recall how you were feeling as the resuscitation unfolded?\u201dLetby said: \u201cI remember it was a huge, unexpected shock.\u201d",
        "Child A died within 90 minutes of Letby starting her shift, the court heard. I wanted to see the people behind the awful event that had happened. They were on my mind  Lucy Letby  Mr Myers asked why she searched for Child A\u2019s mother on Facebook the next day.Letby replied: \u201cI think it was curiosity. I wanted to see the people behind the awful event that had happened. They were on my mind.\u201cIt\u2019s a common pattern of behaviour for me. I think of somebody and I look them up.\u201dLetby is also accused of attempting to murder Child A\u2019s twin sister, Child B, by also administering air into her system.Child B deteriorated in nursery one \u2013 the unit\u2019s intensive care room \u2013 at about 12.30am on June 10 during a shift which saw Letby designated to care for two babies in nursery three.Mr Myers asked: \u201cDo you recall events leading up to (Child B\u2019s) deterioration?\u201dLetby replied: \u201cNot with any clarity, no.\u201dShe said she was in nursery one when she thinks a fellow nurse, who was looking after Child B, alerted her to the deterioration and a colour change.Letby said: \u201cShe became quite mottled and dark. All over her body, from memory.\u201cIt was like general mottling of a baby. It was not unusual but obviously we were concerned for (Child B) because of (Child A\u2019s) decline the night before.",
        "\u201c(Child A) was pale. He was white. (Child B) had some colour; it was a purple mottling colour.\u201dLetby told the court she was asked to retrieve a camera from a manager\u2019s office to take photographs\u00a0 but Child B had stabilised by the time she returned.Letby added: \u201cAnd I got it very quickly.\u201dThe defendant also allegedly murdered a baby boy, Child C, with an injection of air via his feeding tube on the night shift of June 13.Child C collapsed in nursery one at about 11.15pm, 15 minutes after he was said to have received his first milk feed, the court has heard.Letby said she was allocated on the shift to care for two infants in nursery three.She said she first became aware of a problem when the nurse who was designated to care for Child C called for help.Mr Myers asked: \u201cWhere were you before you were called to help?\u201dLetby said: \u201cI was not in nursery one.\u201dShe said she thinks she helped with heart and chest compressions at \u201ccertain times\u201d before the youngster died just before 6am the next day. When you get home from work you don\u2019t forget about babies you cared for and what happened  Lucy Letby  Letby denied standing by the cot when alarms sounded at Child C\u2019s cotside.",
        "Mr Myers asked her why she searched Facebook for Child C\u2019s mother about 10 hours after the boy\u2019s death.Letby said: \u201cBecause the family were very much on my mind. The first time I had met the parents was during the resuscitation of their son.\u201cWhen you get home from work you don\u2019t forget about babies you cared for and what happened.\u201dMr Myers said: \u201cHow do you feel about what they had been through?\u201dLetby replied: \u201cWhat the parents have been through? It\u2019s unimaginable.\u201dShe said she had no memory of events surrounding the death of Child D, a baby girl, who she is said to have injected with air.Child D was being cared for by a colleague in nursery one on the night shift of June 21/22, while Letby was allocated two other infants in the same room.Letby, from Hereford, denies all the allegations against her.The trial continues next Thursday."
