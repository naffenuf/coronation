        "Brighton boss Roberto De Zerbi believes \u201ctop player\u201d Moises Caicedo is capable of playing any position on the pitch.",
        "Caicedo has starred in the Seagulls\u2019 midfield all season but was required to fill in at right-back during Thursday\u2019s dramatic 1-0 win over Manchester United due to injuries to Pascal Gross, Joel Veltman and Tariq Lamptey.With Gross facing a fitness test ahead of Monday evening\u2019s clash with Everton and Veltman likely to remain on the sidelines alongside Lamptey, the Ecuador international could once again be deployed in the makeshift role.Head coach De Zerbi was reluctant to deviate from a four-man defence against United or drop midfielder Billy Gilmour following his starring role in last Saturday\u2019s 6-0 thrashing of Wolves.And the Italian\u2019s decision was vindicated as Caicedo performed admirably in a pulsating game settled by Alexis Mac Allister\u2019s last-gasp penalty.\u201cI thought to change to play with three defenders but I think we reach a high level of football and we have the right technologies playing in this tactical disposition,\u201d said De Zerbi.",
        "\u201cAnd I didn\u2019t want to change.\u201cI think Caicedo can play everywhere. He\u2019s a top, top player.\u201cI love giving players the chance to show me their quality and Gilmour was fantastic against Wolverhampton \u2013 I thought like this.\u201dMac Allister slammed home from the spot in the ninth minute of added time following Luke Shaw\u2019s handball to boost Brighton\u2019s chances of reaching Europe.",
        "The Seagulls are now preparing to complete a trio of consecutive home games against Sean Dyche\u2019s relegation-threatened Toffees.With a further five Premier League fixtures to come during the next three weeks, De Zerbi has urged every member of his squad to be prepared to aid the club\u2019s quest to secure continental qualification.\u201cI want that they stay ready always to play because now we need everybody,\u201d he said.\u201cWe need everybody to achieve our target.\u201dGross and striker Evan Ferguson will be assessed ahead of the Everton clash but Veltman is not expected to be available due to a hamstring issue.Lamptey, Adam Lallana, Jakub Moder and Jeremy Sarmiento remain sidelined for the Seagulls."
