        "The pianist, who is part of Queen Camilla's patronage the Amber Trust, was one of the talents chosen to perform at concert taking place in the grounds of Windsor Castle.\u00a0\u00a0Playing a rendition of Bach's Prelude in C Major, the teenager prompted smiles and applause from the Princess of Wales and Princess Charlotte, leaving the newly crowned King and Queen speechless.\u00a0The stunning performance from the blind musician came just months after Lucy melted hearts with her winning performance for the Channel 4 series The Piano.\u00a0",
        "Those on social media watching the concert from home were quick to applaud the youngster, who is from West Yorkshire, with some even being brought to tears.Lucy, who was born with cancerous tumours in her eyes and is largely non-verbal, left the 20,000 people sitting in the crowd at Windsor Castle stunned, with those watching from home being equally blown away by the moving performance.One person on social media wrote: 'The Coronation Concert\u00a0is incredibly emotional - amazing performances by Lucy and the Romeo and Juliet ensemble.'Another added: 'Wow Lucy - you had me in tears. What a wonderful talent and a beautiful young lady. Bravo!'\u00a0A third said: 'Lucy Illingworth, you are astonishing.'The pianist was one of a number of star-studded performances taking place at the King's celebration this evening, which Buckingham Palace promised would be filled with 'global music icons and contemporary stars'.\u00a0",
