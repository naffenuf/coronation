        "Thousands of people lined the streets of a Surrey village to greet the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh during its Coronation Big Lunch.",
        "Edward and Sophie delighted well-wishers in Cranleigh on Sunday, with some fans dressed in Union flag outfits or plastic crowns, eager to catch a moment of history as the couple passed through.The duke and duchess first delighted children from the Scouts and Beavers who had been waiting outside the door of Cranleigh Village Hall.Before their car arrived slightly behind schedule, excited children were looking at other cars shouting \u201chello?\u201d, \u201cwhere are they?\u201d and \u201cis that them, is that them?\u201d.",
        "On arrival, the couple were welcomed by His Majesty\u2019s Lord-Lieutenant of Surrey before greeting the crowds.The duke joked \u201cit is nice to see that the weather hasn\u2019t changed in 70 years\u201d when asked about Saturday\u2019s celebrations by one well-wisher.Scouts began singing the chorus of God Save the King and there were cries of \u201chip, hip hooray!\u201d as they shook hands with fans.Inside the hall, they greeted people who had set up small businesses and voluntary organisations during the pandemic.Among them were refugee Nataliia Diakonets, 55, who is the only person in the village who can sew handmade Union flags and bunting.",
        "She told the PA news agency: \u201cMy host family knew I can sew so one of them asked me to do some bunting for the Jubilee and I said yes.",
        "\u201cNobody knew how to do it so they were looking for someone. I said I can do it so I did it for the Jubilee and now the coronation.\u201cThe duke was asking if it was hard to do the job and he joked \u2018it is easy to do two colours\u2019 (of the Ukrainian flag) which was quite a funny joke.\u201cHe said he hoped we feel welcome and said he wishes the best for Ukraine.\u201dThe couple then greeted well-wishers from tiny toddlers to Royal British Legion veterans, who told the duke their stories about National Service, along the village\u2019s high street.The duke repeatedly asked people \u201chave you had lunch yet?\u201d and joked \u201cif you find out what it is will you let me know?\u201d.A few people managed to shake his hand but most were left disappointed as he told them \u201cthe trouble is if I did I would be here all day\u201d.",
        "He asked several children \u201cis this what you normally do on a Sunday?\u201d and they revealed their hobbies including football.At one point he pointed at a woman with Percy Pigs in her hand and said \u201cthat is well-prepared\u201d.The royal couple then took a tour of the village\u2019s artisan market, which has stalls once every three weeks, before being presented with a slice of majestic chicken pie by chef Adam Handling on the village green.",
        "Aloine Griffiths, 49, told PA how the duke encouraged her 15-year-old twin sons Rufus and Rasmus to do the silver stage of their Duke of Edinburgh award, and they told him they would.Mrs Griffiths, who lives in the village, said: \u201cHe was asking why Rasmus was wearing a Scotland rugby shirt and my son said his granddad is from Scotland so he supports them in the rugby.\u201cHe was very happy, relaxed and jovial. He was normal.",
        "\u201cIt is lovely to see the royals out and about today and especially Edward as he is the Duke of Edinburgh as there are lots of children around here doing their Duke of Edinburgh who will be encouraged to continue.\u201dLisa Buckman, 41, told PA how her eight-year-old son Ethan managed to hi-five the duchess.He said: \u201cIt was good. It was exciting when she came up and said hello. I said hello back and then gave her a hi-five.\u201dHer six-year-old daughter Amelia also said she had said hello the duchess who asked whether she had a nice day.\u201cI said yes\u201d, the youngster added.Ms Buckman added: \u201cIt has been a really good atmosphere and they were very normal. They took their time to go and speak to everybody. Everybody here has really enjoyed themselves.\u201d"
