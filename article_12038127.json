        "Russia\u2019s defence chief has urged a state company to double its missile output, as a possible Ukrainian counter-offensive looms and with both sides in the 14-month war reportedly feeling an ammunition crunch.",
        "Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu, speaking at a meeting with top military brass, said the state-owned Tactical Missiles Corporation had been fulfilling its contracts in a timely manner.But, Mr Shoigu added, \u201cright now it is necessary to double the production of high-precision weapons in the shortest possible time\u201d.Analysts have been trying to work out whether Russia is running low on high-precision ammunition, as its missile barrages against Ukraine have become less frequent and smaller in scale.The UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence noted in an assessment on Tuesday that \u201clogistics problems remain at the heart of Russia\u2019s struggling campaign in Ukraine\u201d.\u201cRussia does not have enough munitions to achieve success on the offensive,\u201d it said.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Tuesday described Washington\u2019s latest estimate of Russia\u2019s losses in Ukraine as \u201cspun out of thin air\u201d.The White House said on Monday it now estimated that just since December Russia had suffered 100,000 casualties, including more than 20,000 killed, as Ukraine rebuffed a heavy assault by Russian forces in eastern Ukraine.White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said the US estimate was based on newly declassified American intelligence.He did not explain how the intelligence community derived the number.\u201cWashington doesn\u2019t have the opportunity to give any correct numbers. They don\u2019t have such data,\u201d Mr Peskov said.",
        "Later in the day, the Ukrainian military reported that Russian forces launched 30 air strikes, three missile strikes and eight attacks from multiple rocket launchers on Tuesday, resulting in casualties among the civilian population and damage to civilian infrastructure.The General Staff of Ukraine\u2019s armed forces said Russia was continuing to concentrate its efforts on offensive operations in Ukraine\u2019s industrial east, focusing attacks around Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Marinka in the country\u2019s Donetsk province. The material in the donation package is important to pave the way for Ukrainian tanks and the armoured infantry in the front line  Troels Lund Poulsen, acting Danish defence minister  The prosecutor\u2019s office in Ukraine\u2019s southern Kherson province reported that Russian shelling in the regional capital, also called Kherson, and several villages killed three people and wounded five.Ukrainian forces, meanwhile, say they are readying their own counter-offensive \u2013 and stockpiling ammunition to sustain it along potentially long supply lines.Ukrainian defence minister Oleksiy Reznikov said on Monday that the \u201ckey things\u201d for the assault\u2019s success were \u201cthe availability of weapons, prepared, trained people, our defenders and defenders who know their plan at their level, as well as providing this offensive with all the necessary things \u2013 shells, ammunition, fuel, protection, etc\u201d.\u201cAs of today, we are entering the home stretch, when we can say: \u2018Yes, everything is ready\u2019,\u201d Mr Reznikov said in televised comments.",
        "Also on Tuesday, Denmark said it was donating 1.7 billion kroner (\u00a3201 million) in aid to Ukraine, including mine clearance vehicles, munition, field bridges and money for air defence that will be needed for a counter-offensive against Russian forces that are dug in behind multilayered defensive lines, including hundreds of miles of trenches.\u201cWe know that the Russians have entrenched themselves in the occupied territories of Ukraine with trenches, minefields and other obstacles to stop a Ukrainian offensive,\u201d acting Danish defence minister Troels Lund Poulsen said.\u201cThe material in the donation package is important to pave the way for Ukrainian tanks and the armoured infantry in the front line.\u201dIn recent months, amid winter weather, the conflict has become bogged down in a war of attrition that has depleted ammunition stocks.The Kremlin\u2019s forces took aim at Ukraine\u2019s critical infrastructure with long-range strikes, while Kyiv has zeroed in on Russian targets with precision artillery provided by its western allies.In February, Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg warned that Ukraine was using up ammunition far faster than its allies could provide it.According to some estimates, Ukraine was at that time firing up to 6,000-7,000 artillery shells each day, around a third of the daily amount that Russia is using almost one year into the war.",
        "Sporadic night-time Russian shelling continued to hit Ukrainian areas early on Tuesday, officials said.At least seven civilians were wounded, authorities said."
