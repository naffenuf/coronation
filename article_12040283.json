        "\"I feel like the changeup was good when I needed it,\" Sandoval said. \"It was a bit of a grind though. For whatever reason I couldn't get a grip on the ball the whole game. It was kind of frustrating, but I battled and got through five.\"Chris Devenski, making his second appearance since he was brought up from the minors. relieved with two on in the sixth, got Nolan Arenado to ground into a double play and retired Dylan Carlson on a flyout.Devenski, a 32-year-old right-hander in his eighth big league season, pitched a perfect seventh.Matt Moore struck out three around a single in the eighth, and Carlos Est\u00e9vez struck out two in a perfect ninth.Matz allowed four runs, four hits and two walks in five innings.\"I got into a rhythm after that first inning.\" Matz said. \"One pitch got me bad there. Not the start I was going for, start of the season or the game. I've got a lot of things I need to address and look at. Ultimately I can look at the four innings today finishing strong, so I'll build off that.\"REMEMBERING AN ICONThe Cardinals held a pregame moment of silence for former player and broadcaster Mike Shannon who died on Sunday. Shannon played with the Cardinals for parts of nine seasons before spending 50 years in the broadcast booth.",
