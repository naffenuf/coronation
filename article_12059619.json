        "Bradford booked their place in the League Two play-offs with a 1-1 draw against champions Leyton Orient.",
        "Right-back Brad Halliday scored his first goal for over two years to earn the point they needed after Jordan Brown had put the visitors in front.The point secured sixth place for Mark Hughes\u2019 side and they will play Carlisle in the play-offs.Bradford went close after four minutes as Andy Cook\u2019s looping header was tipped on to the crossbar by Lawrence Vigouroux.Romoney Crichlow stabbed wide from Sam Stubbs\u2019 flick-on, Jamie Walker fired into the side-netting and Vigouroux again saved well from Cook.But it was Orient who struck first after 41 minutes when Bradford failed to deal with a corner before Brown swept home from 10 yards.",
        "The home side\u2019s response was rapid. Just three minutes later they were level as Halliday\u2019s volley took a heavy deflection beyond Vigouroux.Shadrach Ogie shot just over for Orient before Vigouroux was again in action to keep out Liam Ridehalgh\u2019s drive as the game ended level."
