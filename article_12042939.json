        "The Government has been accused of intentionally wanting to keep a \u2018loophole\u2019 in UK election law that might be letting foreign countries donate to political parties through the back door.",
        "A Lords amendment to the National Security Bill would have introduced new transparency measures on UK-registered political parties with respect to donations received from foreign powers.However, MPs rejected it by 254 votes to 134, majority 120, with Security Minister Tom Tugendhat insisting the law already makes \u201crobust provision in relation to donations to political parties\u201d.",
        "Disagreeing with Mr Tugendhat, Labour former minister Sir Chris Bryant asked in the Commons: \u201cWhat would a party do if, for instance, they were offered a donation for, let\u2019s say, \u00a350,000 by somebody who lives and works in Moscow today?\u201cThe law says they have to do nothing as long as they are on the electoral register.\u201cBut surely, we would want to say I\u2019m not sure that that\u2019s quite right.\u201dHe described the provisions in the Lords amendment as the \u201cminimum\u201d, adding: \u201cI have said that there\u2019s a flaw in PPERA (the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act ) \u2026 but the danger is, I\u2019m starting to worry that the Government wants it to exist as a loophole, because otherwise I simply don\u2019t understand why the minister is holding out on this point.\u201dThe Conservative chairman of Parliament\u2019s Intelligence and Security Committee, Sir Julian Lewis, also gave his backing to the Lords amendment, as he argued it would \u201chelp to increase the transparency and accountability of our political system\u201d.",
        "He insisted the UK has previously \u201cclearly welcomed Russian money, including in the political sphere\u201d, and said: \u201cThe amendment is eminently reasonable, it shouldn\u2019t be controversial for political parties to want to ensure the transparency of their foreign political donations.\u201cWe must protect against covert, foreign state-backed financial donations if we are to defend our democratic institutions from harmful interference and influence.\u201dMeanwhile, shadow Home Office minister Holly Lynch challenged Mr Tugendhat to say that alternative provisions are effective and that \u201cdirty money with a price attached isn\u2019t finding its way into our system and into our democracy\u201d.Closing the debate, Mr Tugendhat said the Government has to treat \u201cBritish citizens like British citizens\u201d, adding: \u201cThe idea that we can treat British citizens differently, depending on how we feel about them seems to me rather a bad way of making law.\u201cThat, however, does not mean that political parties have to treat British citizens the same.\u201cAnd the rule in this surely is just because you can, doesn\u2019t mean you should. There are many donations, there are possibly many individuals who many of us would not wish to accept donations from. And the point about politics is it\u2019s about decisions. It\u2019s about judgment. It\u2019s about choices.\u201d",
        "The Bill will now return to the House of Lords, where peers will decide whether to accept the Government\u2019s rejection of their amendment or propose a different one.",
        "Dr Susan Hawley, executive director of Spotlight on Corruption, said: \u201cThe Government\u2019s strong words on tackling foreign influence and defending UK democracy ring very hollow today.\u201cThis is a badly missed opportunity by the Government to protect the next election from malign influences and make sure that political parties play their role in protecting the UK political system from dirty money.\u201dThe Bill as a whole aims to update Britain\u2019s security laws to combat modern-day state threats, including sabotage, spying, foreign interference and economic espionage.",
        "Concerns were raised in the Lords that moves to grant criminal immunity to the intelligence services and military in assisting overseas operations could provide legal cover for tipping off other states in cases of torture or extraordinary rendition.The Government stressed it would not make it legal to encourage or enable torture or rendition or solicit murder.Liberal Democrat former minister Alistair Carmichael tabled an amendment to specify the protection did not apply to torture or inhuman, cruel or degrading treatment or punishment, or the violation of a person\u2019s sexual integrity.His amendment was defeated by 252 votes to 132, majority 120.Peers and MPs also pushed for the remit of Parliament\u2019s Intelligence and Security Committee to be updated to improve scrutiny of the intelligence services, although the Commons voted 254 to 136 \u2013 majority 118 \u2013 to disagree with this change."
