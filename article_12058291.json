        "The Little Mermaid star\u00a0Halle Bailey went in for the kiss in a new teaser of The Little Mermaid\u00a0played during the\u00a02023 MTV Movie &amp; TV Awards\u00a0on Sunday.",
        "In a never-before-seen scene and first look at the film's iconic Kiss The Girl number, the 23-year-old singer, who plays Ariel, shared an intimate moment with Prince Eric \u2014 played by Jonah Hauer-King, 27 \u2014 during a romantic canoe ride.Kiss the Girl was playing in the background as the pair are seen sitting in a boat underneath the willow trees.As their sea animal friends encouraged them to kiss, the characters were interrupted multiple times due to their own shyness or coincidentally when the boat flipped.\u00a0The live-action reimagining of the animated film will receive a theatrical release later this month on May 26.",
        "In the beginning of the sneak peek preview, the five-time Grammy nominee was seen in a baby blue, tulle gown and a pink bandana tied around her hair.The World On Fire star sported a white pirate shirt like in the animated movie but also sported a navy blue, double-breasted vest.\u00a0The pair were seen laying in a boat shoulder-to-shoulder but are too nervous to look each other in the eye.\u00a0Ariel and Prince Eric started leaning in for a smooch, but the red-headed beauty suddenly sat up when the canoe floated into low-hanging willow leaves.Magically, fireflies started surrounding the pair, and they appeared mesmerized by the twinkling sight.",
        "All of a sudden, a school of fish appeared and swam around the boat causing a slow rotation.Ariel's gilled friends \u2014 unbeknownst to Eric \u2014 attempted to make the moment more romantic by spitting water to create a fountain.When water splashed onto Eric, Ariel touched his face \u2014 causing the two share a sweet moment.",
        "Now holding hands, they went in for a kiss again, but at the very last moment, the boat flipped.\u00a0According to the official synopsis, The Little Mermaid tells the story of Ariel \u2014 the youngest of King Triton's many daughters.The 'bright and spirited young mermaid with a thirst for adventure' \u2014 who longs to 'find out more about the world beyond the sea' \u2014 makes a trip to the surface and meets Prince Eric.'Following her heart, she makes a deal with the evil sea witch, Ursula, to experience life on land,' the summary read.\u00a0Iconic songs from The Little Mermaid soundtrack have had their lyrics changed to reflect consent in the upcoming live action remake of the 1989 Disney film.Composer Alan Menken told Vanity Fair\u00a0last month: 'There are some lyric changes in Kiss the Girl because people have gotten very sensitive about the idea that [Prince Eric] would, in any way, force himself on [Ariel].",
        "The lyrics to the original song - which encourage Prince Eric to kiss Ariel before it's too late and without asking for her consent - include the chorus lines: 'Yes, you want her.\u00a0 Look at her, you know you do.\u00a0 Possible she wants you too.\u00a0 There is one way to ask her.\u00a0 It don't take a word. Not a single word.\u00a0 Go on and kiss the girl.'Menken added: 'We have some revisions in Poor Unfortunate Souls regarding lines that might make young girls somehow feel that they shouldn\u2019t speak out of turn.'Even though Ursula is clearly manipulating Ariel to give up her voice.'In the original song, Ursula sings: 'The men up there don't like a lot of blabber. They think a girl who gossips is a bore!'Yet on land it's much preferred for ladies not to say a word'And after all dear, what is idle babble for? Come on, they're not all that impressed with conversation. True gentlemen avoid it when they can'But they dote and swoon and fawn. On a lady who's withdrawn It's she who holds her tongue who gets a man.'",
        "The lyrics for the songs on the 1989 soundtrack were written by the late Howard Ashman and composed by Menken.Menken has joined producer\u00a0Lin-Manuel Miranda to write new music for the remake and rework the original songs.",
        "The long-running awards show was one of the first victims of the ongoing dispute between the\u00a0Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers and the Writers Guild of America union.Writers are now on strike and picketing studios, leading the host Drew Barrymore to announce she was dropping out last Sunday.The 48-year-old actress-turned-talk show host had been set to MC the festivities, but she is now putting her clout behind writers struggling to earn better pay and guarantees on staffing, as studios increasingly try to limit the size of writers' rooms and shrink the number of episodes per series.\u00a0\u00a0'I have listened to the writers, and in order to truly respect them, I will pivot from hosting the MTV Movie &amp; TV Awards live in solidarity with the strike,' Barrymore told Variety. 'Everything we celebrate and honor about movies and television is born out of their creation.'The labor action has also led the awards show to cancel its red carpet festivities, and other stars may also drop out to show support to strikers.On Thursday, Vanderpump Rules star Lala Kent also announced she was no longer attending as a show of solidarity.'Although Vanderpump Rules falls under the unscripted sector of TV, that is not an excuse for me to remain silent and carry on as if there isn\u2019t so much at stake for every writer and their families,' she told The Hollywood Reporter\u00a0in a statement. 'We have to protect our creators and I hope you\u2019ll stand with me and many others as we do so until we reach a resolution (hopefully very soon).'",
