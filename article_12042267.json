        "On Saturday, the coronation service will be held at Westminster Abbey following a procession from Buckingham Palace.Other restrictions on that day include some relating to a helicopter flight from London to Chippenham, which is believed to be for the Queen Consort to travel to her Wiltshire home.There are also curbs on airspace usage due to a flypast of more than 60 aircraft from the Royal Navy, British Army and Royal Air Force \u2013 including the Red Arrows \u2013 over The Mall at around 2.15pm on Saturday.",
        "The PA news agency understands the airspace restrictions will have an impact on light aircraft pilots and drone users, but not commercial flights.That is in contrast with the day of the late Queen\u2019s funeral, when more than 100 Heathrow Airport flights were cancelled to prevent aircraft noise disturbing proceedings at Westminster Abbey and Windsor Castle."
