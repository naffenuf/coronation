        "The lawsuit accused the Times and three of its investigative reporters of relentlessly seeking out his estranged niece, Mary Trump, as a source of information and convincing her to turn over confidential documents.

The Times and its reporters on Wednesday succeeded in getting a judge to dismiss the claims against them.\"Plaintiff's claims against The Times defendants, as an initial matter, fail as a matter of constitutional law,\" Robert Reed of the New York State Supreme Court wrote. He said that legal news gathering is \"at the very core of protected First Amendment activity.\"Reed also ordered Trump to pay legal expenses for the newspaper and its reporters, Susanne Craig, David Barstow and Russ Buettner.Trump attorney Alina Habba said \"we will weigh our client\u00b4s options.\"",

The New York Times is no different and its reporters went well beyond the conventional news gathering techniques permitted by the First Amendment,\" she said in an email.The Times\u00b4 reporting challenged Trump\u00b4s claims of self-made wealth by documenting how his father, Fred, had given him at least $413 million over the decades, including through tax avoidance schemes.",
