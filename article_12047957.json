        "RAF officers have been working around the clock to perfect their part in the King\u2019s coronation this weekend, which will be the largest ceremonial military operation in 70 years.",
        "Saturday\u2019s celebrations will involve more than 9,000 service personnel, more than 6,000 of whom will be on ceremonial duties.",
        "Just under 1,000 members will be representatives of the Royal Air Force, of which King Charles is Commander-in-Chief.RAF personnel have been training at RAF Halton and RAF Northolt since April 27.Along with the ceremonial King\u2019s Colour squadron, regulars and reservists were selected through ballots to join the procession, with a majority coming from units that have a service link to the royal family.",
        "Speaking from RAF Halton in Buckinghamshire, Air Chief Marshal Sir Mike Wigston told the PA news agency: \u201cThe ceremony and the procession and the immaculate turn out of our aviators, sailors and soldiers will be something that we will be incredibly proud of.\u201cThere are about a thousand people representing the RAF on Saturday, but there are 33,000 more who would give anything to be where they are.\u201dHe added: \u201cI feel a huge sense of pride as the head of the service, but every member will be feeling that same sense of pride on Saturday.\u201d",
        "The King and Queen Consort have been described as having a special relationship with the Royal Air Force. Charles began his Armed Services career at RAF Cranwell in Lincolnshire, while Camilla is Honorary Air Commodore of RAF Halton.",
        "\u201cThis is an opportunity to show our respect and show our devotion on Saturday as part of this great parade,\u201d Sir Michael said.\u201cSeeing that bond with our sovereign, but also the immaculate turnout, the perfection and the precision, I can\u2019t help but think that it will spark an interest in any young person to consider a military career.\u201dOfficer Cadet Benjamin Bellchambers, 24, was due to graduate from his officer training at RAF Cranwell on Thursday, and plans to begin a career as a pilot.",
        "\u201cThirty of us were chosen to come down from RAF Cranwell, 26 of us are cadets. We\u2019ve been working since we got here on Thursday last week,\u201d he said.\u201cI was definitely tired after the overnight rehearsal on Tuesday, but we\u2019re all pushing through and very excited for the weekend.\u201dLike Officer Cadet Bellchambers, Squadron Leader David Kerrison and Warrant Officer Clare Horler expect that taking part in the King\u2019s coronation procession will be a highlight of their careers \u2014 but both joined the RAF more than 30 years ago in 1987, graduating together on the same day.The coronation will be WO Horler\u2019s final day in uniform.\u201cEven the evening practice, the public response was incredible and very uplifting,\u201d she told PA.Squadron Leader Kerrison said that the pride of representing the RAF \u201cat this grand occasion\u201d would be \u201cincredible\u201d.",
        "The march will be led by the Procession Band, which will play a number of arrangements throughout the march.Air Specialist (Class 1) Poppy Ewence has performed as an oboist at a number of high-profile events, including the late Queen\u2019s funeral.\u201cIt\u2019s a great privilege to be able to perform at two such monumental ceremonial events in one year,\u201d she said.\u201cMy personal favourite piece is Coronation Bells, which has been adapted for the coronation, it\u2019s really exciting and really jubilant, with lots of countermelodies, and this is probably the only time that I will be able to perform it.\u201dBut adverse weather conditions could mean that the flypast scheduled to take place on Saturday, which the Royal Air Force has also been rehearsing for, may need to be called off at the last minute.\u201cThe weather isn\u2019t looking brilliant, but there\u2019s nothing we can do about it,\u201d Sir Mike said.",
        "\u201cWe have to be safe, we have to make sure that we aren\u2019t taking any unnecessary risks.\u201cWe\u2019ll make a weather call one or two hours before the actual moment, but if there\u2019s rain and low cloud then it will be almost impossible to get it through.\u201cIt\u2019s 50/50 at the moment, but we have lots of options, the decision will be made, at this stage we\u2019re hoping for the best.",
        "\u201cThe flypast has required a lot of practising too, there\u2019s been a lot of rehearsing going on out on the North Sea,\u201d he added.\u201cIf the flypast does go ahead then it will be as spectacular as the ceremonies on the ground.\u201d"
