        "It emerged after claims Chloe had quit\u00a0Geordie Shore again in protest after Sam was suspended from the show for being involved in a bust-up.\u00a0Insiders told The Sun that Chloe followed Sam as he left for a second time after a row broke out.Sam had previously left the show just weeks before, following a row with Chloe, who he\u00a0 endured an on-off relationship with.She herself quit the show after splitting from Sam but returned weeks after.\u00a0"
