        "Pep Guardiola has warned that Erling Haaland\u2019s second season at Manchester City could be even better than his first.",
        "Haaland is on the brink of setting a new single-season Premier League goalscoring record after a sensational first campaign at the Etihad Stadium.The prolific Norwegian netted his 34th goal of the champions\u2019 2022-23 league programme \u2013 and his 50th overall \u2013 in Sunday\u2019s victory at Fulham.That drew him level with joint competition record-holders Andy Cole and Alan Shearer and, with six games to play starting with Wednesday\u2019s visit of West Ham, the 22-year-old looks certain to set a formidable new benchmark.Guardiola, however, believes his best could be yet to come.The City manager said: \u201cAlways I\u2019ve said with Erling it will be tough when you look at what he has done \u2013 and if he doesn\u2019t score the goals like he\u2019s scoring now people will say, \u2018Oh, he\u2019s in a bad situation\u2019 \u2013 but his game can improve a lot.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say in the box but in the game itself, the movements. I think he has that feeling, \u2018Is that enough?\u2019, and I think he has the desire to get better as a player.\u201cAs long as he has that he can do it.\u201dGuardiola believes Haaland, who joined City last summer after plundering 86 goals in 89 appearances for Borussia Dortmund, arrived with a determination to break records.",
        "He said: \u201cYes, I think so. I know him a bit and he is so competitive and positive in his mindset.\u201cHe has this incredible, positive self-confidence. It\u2019s not arrogance.\u201cIt\u2019s self-confidence to say I am going to score and to arrive in his first season and score 50 already and equal the record for two legends in Andy Cole and Alan Shearer.\u201dHaaland\u2019s remarkable record has raised the prospect he could even surpass the English record 63 goals for a top-flight player scored by Everton\u2019s Dixie Dean in 1927-28.Comparisons have also been made with Lionel Messi, who scored 73 for Barcelona in 2011-12, but Guardiola says drawing parallels with one of the all-time greats is unfair.Messi\u2019s former Barca boss said: \u201cNo-one can compare with Messi. It will not help Erling.",
        "\u201cMessi is the most complete player I have seen in terms of vision, dribbles, passes, competitiveness, in many things that are difficult.\u201cHopefully Erling can be so close (to) Leo, that will be great for us and him, but I don\u2019t help anyone to compare them with the Argentina player.\u201dHaaland has established a potent partnership with playmaker Kevin De Bruyne, who is hoping to overcome a knock to feature against the Hammers.De Bruyne said: \u201cHe\u2019s matched the record for the Premier League scoring 34 goals.",
        "\u201cI am just trying to help him achieve that and he has been able to do it. I just try to create as many chances as I can and he is ready to pounce in the box. We work really well together and he has been great.\u201d"
