        "Dundee United boss Jim Goodwin insisted his side are still in a good position in their battle against the drop, despite his side\u2019s 1-0 defeat to St Johnstone at McDiarmid Park.",
        "Saints\u2019 captain Liam Gordon steered home just before half-time after United were unable to clear their lines and the visitors saw Charlie Mulgrew sent off in the second half as they failed to find a leveller.The defeat ended a run of three successive cinch Premiership victories and Goodwin urged perspective as he praised the attitude of his side.He said: \u201cIf we\u2019d gone down without a fight then I would be very disappointed, but the character is there in the group.\u201cWe are in a decent position if you consider where we were prior to the Hibs game. If I was sitting here still five points adrift, I\u2019d be very concerned. But we\u2019re not.\u201cWe are still level on points with Kilmarnock, albeit Ross County have closed that gap.",
        "\u201cIt looks like it will be between the three of us at the bottom and we have great belief in the group.\u201dSt Johnstone manager Steven MacLean, meanwhile, played down the five point gap his side have opened up ahead of the teams below them as he praised the collective effort of his team.MacLean, who earned a point against Hibs in his first game in interim charge, saw the Saints win at home for the first time since beating Rangers 2-1 in early November.",
        "He said: \u201cIt\u2019s massive but it\u2019s only a cushion. I don\u2019t look at other teams. People pointed out last week that teams had won under us but I\u2019m only interested in our club and what we do.\u201cI think you can see that we\u2019re improving and we\u2019re getting better and if win our games then we\u2019ll be fine.\u201cWe don\u2019t just defend as a back four. We defend from the front and also Liam Gordon has scored the goal so it\u2019s a collective. We don\u2019t work as individuals \u2013 we\u2019ve got to be good as a group. I\u2019m delighted for everybody.\u201dSt Johnstone have another home match against Motherwell next week and MacLean \u2013 who is relishing his role as interim boss \u2013 hopes they can use Saturday\u2019s result to build some momentum and go on a run of wins.He added: \u201cThere\u2019s improvement in this team. I think everybody can see that we\u2019re getting there. We\u2019re working hard in training. You can see slight changes that we\u2019re making and hopefully they\u2019re enjoying it as much as I am but I think we can get better too.\u201cI want to keep winning. I\u2019m not just about one or two games. I want to go on a run and I want to make this team better like I know they can be.",
        "\u201cI want to concentrate on Motherwell next week. I\u2019ll watch their games and we\u2019ll work in training for Motherwell and try to win the game.\u201d"
