        "The chairman and chief executive of HSBC had several climate protesters thrown out of its annual general meeting on Friday as shareholders rejected a plan which could have split the bank in two.",
        "Investors voted by 80.22% to not accept the plan to split off the company\u2019s Asian arm, which had been suggested by its biggest shareholder, Ping An.It happened after a turbulent meeting where the first protester to stand up accused the bank of being \u201cchief arsonists\u201d in the climate crisis.At the Birmingham meeting, he said: \u201cOur grandchildren will inherit a polluted planet and they will curse us for it. This is a disgrace and you should be ashamed. We concluded that the alternative structural options would materially destroy value for shareholders, including putting your dividends at risk. This remains our unanimous view today  Mark Tucker, HSBC  \u201cYou are the chief arsonists \u2013 this organisation has been described as a financial arson organisation and you are the chief arsonist. I don\u2019t know how you sleep at night knowing that millions of people are going to starve to death because of the investments that this bank is making.\u201dMinutes apart several other protesters stood up, one by one, expressing similar terms. Eventually, chairman Mark Tucker and chief executive Noel Quinn asked security to escort the protesters from the room.\u201cThank you for your patience, security are resolving the situation,\u201d Mr Tucker told shareholders.One protester accused the bank of funding a company which was bulldozing a village in Germany to expand a coal mine.",
        "Outside the meeting, one protester wearing a suit was pictured sitting in a green bath which had a sign reading: \u201cHSBC greenwashing\u201d on its side.The man was covered in green paint and surrounded by protesters dressed as cleaning staff while a green flare had been let off.During the meeting, Mr Tucker also urged shareholders to vote against the plan which would split the company in two.He said that the board has considered the proposal \u201ccarefully and fully,\u201d but said they felt it would destroy value at the bank.\u201cLast year, with the benefit of expert advice from third parties, the board considered a wide range of alternative structural options for your bank in depth.\u201cWe concluded that the alternative structural options would materially destroy value for shareholders, including putting your dividends at risk. This remains our unanimous view today.\u201dThe resolution, to spin off the company\u2019s Asian arm, was proposed by a group which has backing from Ping An, HSBC\u2019s largest shareholders.Apart from Ping An, it appeared that most shareholders had accepted the board\u2019s recommendation.The company further said that 20.25% of votes were cast against the pay package for its top team and several other votes were cast only around four to one in favour, including the re-election of the chairman and the chief executive."
