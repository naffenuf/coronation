        "Rafael Nadal announced Friday that he will not participate in the upcoming Internazionali BNL d'Italia due to his left hip flexor injury.",
        "Nadal, who has won the Italian tournament a record 10 times, has missed events at Indian Wells, Miami, Monte Carlo, Barcelona and Madrid due to the injury he sustained in the second round of the Australian Open in January.\"Hello everyone! I'm so sorry to announce that I won't be able to play in Rome,\" the 22-time Grand Slam winner wrote in Spanish on social media. \"You all know how much it hurts me to miss another of the tournaments that has been so important to me, both professionally and personally, because of all the affection and support of the Italian fans.\"Despite having noticed an improvement in the last few days, it has been many months since I've been able to train at a high level and the adaptation process takes time. All that is left for me to do is accept it and keep working. Best wishes to everyone.\"Nadal, 36, did not address his availability to defend his title at the upcoming French Open, however. Action at Roland Garros gets underway on May 28.--Field Level Media"
