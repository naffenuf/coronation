        "The Government \u201csimply won\u2019t know\u201d how many people have been turned away from polling stations on Thursday because they lack ID, a senior MP has said.",
        "Voters at Thursday\u2019s local elections will for the first time be required to present photo ID before casting their ballots.But amid fears that the requirement could lead to many people being unable to vote, Labour MP Clive Betts has said that current plans will not allow the Government to find out exactly how many people have been turned away.Mr Betts, who chairs the Commons Levelling Up, Housing and Communities Committee, spoke after receiving a letter from the Electoral Commission that said data from greeters standing outside polling stations would not allow it to \u201caccurately quantify the wider impact of the policy\u201d.He said: \u201cThe Electoral Commission has confirmed that we simply won\u2019t know how many people will have been turned away in a queue outside a polling station because they do not have the requisite ID. It appears that the Government has designed a system which denies the prospect of sensible and co-ordinated information collection and makes it almost impossible to judge the true impact of the introduction of voter ID.  MP Clive Betts  \u201cIt appears that the Government has designed a system which denies the prospect of sensible and co-ordinated information collection and makes it almost impossible to judge the true impact of the introduction of voter ID.\u201d",
        "The Electoral Commission intends to record the number of people who are refused a ballot paper by polling station staff because they lack ID, but not if they are turned away after speaking to the greeters that some local authorities plan to deploy outside polling stations.In a letter to Mr Betts, Electoral Commission chairman John Pullinger said using data from greeters would be \u201cinherently unreliable\u201d as some people may turn around before speaking to anyone and others may not be recognised if they later return with the correct ID.Instead, the Electoral Commission will carry out opinion polling to gain \u201cevidence on the fullest impact of the ID requirement\u201d.Polling after voter ID pilot programmes found 2% of non-voters did not cast a ballot because of the ID requirement.Mr Betts said: \u201cWe are barely days away from voters going to the polls.\u201cThe Electoral Commission should spell out what other arrangements they can make, at this late stage, to record all the individuals without appropriate voter ID that may be turned away, at any point, on May 4.\u201dCritics of the voter ID policy have said it could result in large numbers of people being unable to vote, with about two million UK voters thought not to possess the correct form of ID, while fewer than 100,000 have applied for a certificate that would allow them to vote.",
        "Rebecca Baker, an academic at the University of Exeter and an expert in democratic decline, said: \u201cIt is apparent that not enough voters are aware of the change or have sufficient access to trusted information to feel secure in the options available in relation to gaining the required ID.\u201cThe Government has recognised this knowledge would be vital, and without it, the risk of this rollout impeding the voting process rather than \u2018safeguarding\u2019 it, is high.\u201dOn April 27, levelling up minister Rachel Maclean told the Commons the policy was necessary for \u201cmaintaining the British public\u2019s trust in the sanctity of the ballot box\u201d and the Government was \u201cvery concerned to get the process of data collection right\u201d.Ms Maclean said data would be collected at polling stations and through a \u201cvoter identification evaluation form\u201d."
