        "A nurse who was invited to the \u201celectric\u201d Coronation Concert as a coronation champion has spoken fondly of how everyone was \u201csinging along\u201d and cheering for the Prince of Wales when he gave his speech for the King.",
        "Michelle Beaver, 51, and her husband Peter, 55, travelled from Liverpool to Windsor to attend Sunday\u2019s concert, donning red T-shirts adorned with the words Queen and King respectively, and holding flags given to them by volunteers.",
        "Mrs Beaver was invited after being chosen as a coronation champion for volunteering with and fundraising for the Marie Curie Hospice in Liverpool for more than 10 years.The coronation champion programme rewards extraordinary volunteers across the country who have contributed to their communities.When asked by the PA news agency if the concert had lived up to her expectations, the cardiology nurse at Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital said: \u201cIt was better.\u201cWe had a better view than I realised we would have \u2013 we were near the front, which was amazing.\u201cThe atmosphere was electric and everyone was so chatty, sharing where they travelled from to get here and it was such an honour to have been chosen as a coronation champion.\u201dThe star-studded event featured British band Take That, Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli, and US singers Katy Perry and Nicole Scherzinger, with the latter\u2019s rendition of Reflection from Disney\u2019s Mulan garnering high praise from Mrs Beaver.\u201c(Nicole Scherzinger)\u2019s voice was absolutely amazing and I loved Lang Lang on the piano, although I would have loved if it was longer as I like his work.",
        "\u201cAndrea Bocelli was also fantastic.\u201dShe said that a performance from 13-year-old Lucy, the blind and autistic winner of Channel 4\u2019s The Piano, was well-received too, adding: \u201cTake That was also great as they got the crowd going loads and everyone was singing along.\u201d",
        "Another highlight for Mrs Beaver was William\u2019s speech for his father, in which the Prince of Wales told the King: \u201cPa, we are all so proud of you.\u201d\u201cThe cheers for Prince William, especially when he gave his speech, was just lovely,\u201d Mrs Beaver said.\u201cThroughout the concert, people were waving their arms and having lots of fun.\u201dShe said that walking up to the \u201cimpressive\u201d castle was an experience she will not forget as it was her first time in Windsor.\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely massive and the gardens are gorgeous.\u201cThe graphics on the castle during the concert which were about the natural beauty of the world and the ones in the sky were also so impressive.\u201dAs part of her training for physical fundraising challenges such as treks, Mrs Beaver usually tries to do press-ups when attending events and made sure to do around 10 before the audience area got too busy.\u201cI did them with the stage in the background, and what a place to do them.\u201d",
        "Despite not getting to meet Kate and William when they surprised people gathering on the Long Walk earlier on Sunday, Mrs Beaver used her camera to zoom in and \u201cjust about\u201d see the family in the royal box during the show.",
        "However, the cardiology nurse met the King twice \u2013 at the Marie Curie Hospice in Liverpool in 2019 and then at a garden party at Buckingham Palace.She said: \u201cThe first thing I noticed was that he was extremely charming.\u201cHe also had a lovely handshake and such a warm smile.\u201dMrs Beaver watched the coronation on television and then invited some friends over for afternoon tea.",
        "\u201cThe weather was lovely in Liverpool on the day and everyone was in such a good mood.\u201cIt\u2019s bustling here at the moment because Eurovision is happening soon too \u2013 it\u2019s a double whammy.\u201d"
