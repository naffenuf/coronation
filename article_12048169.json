We get it your thin but this is too much.''Kyle??? Wayyyyy toooo thin. Even if she is sucking in. Intervention time,' another wrote.'Breathe Kyle, not a good look,' another posted.But not everyone was up in arms over the weight loss - one Instagram user defended Kyle and suggested her 'rib flare' was down to an 'awkward' pose she was striking.\u00a0",
        "'The body shaming is awful! Get a grip people- @kylerichards18 is extremely petite and her ribs are sticking out from an awkward posture, maybe holding her breath more than likely.

I'm not having any sugar, any carbs, any alcohol,' Richards explained during an appearance on the Two T's In a Pod podcast with Teddi Mellencamp and Tamra Judge in January.'A lot of people think I've been taking Ozempic. To clarify I've never taken Ozempic,' she said.",

I was like 'why would I go back to that?' Richards shared.'So I still have not had alcohol at all, and you know, I'll have a bite of birthday cake here and there but that's it,' she clarified.",
        "She also addressed rumors that she underwent surgery to lose weight, revealing she only went under the knife once for a breast reduction.'I had a breast reduction. I wanted a tummy tuck because of the skin from having four babies, the excess skin,' she added.'Because no matter how much you workout, you always will have that skin, if it's not taken away,' Richards continued.She\u00a0offered more details on her diet regimen in the comments of a bikini snap she posted back in January.\u00a0'NO alcohol, bread, pasta, sugar. I eat protein, fruit and vegetables. Now that I am the weight I want to be, I will have the occasional small amount of pasta etc once in a while. But no alcohol since July 15,' she confirmed.'I workout every day. Chasing it up between running, cycling, hiking and yoga. Weights &amp; stomach everyday,' she added."
