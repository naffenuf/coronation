        "WARNING: DISTRESSING CONTENTSgt Martin Dunn, of Greater Manchester Police, hit puppy after pooing in houseREAD MORE:\u00a0Moment police officer PUNCHES\u00a0 puppy four times in his gardenA police officer who was caught on camera repeatedly punching his\u00a0five month-old Springer Spaniel puppy has been sacked by his force after admitting animal cruelty.",
        "Sergeant Martin Dunn worked in Greater Manchester Police's Specialist Operations Branch when in March 2021 he was filmed repeatedly punching the puppy after it had defecated in a house.The incident was filmed and shared online with it officially reported to police who launched an investigation.In April 2021 he admitted causing unnecessary harm to an animal contrary to the Animal Welfare Act at Leeds Magistrates' Court and handed a community order, 120 hours of unpaid work and a five year ban from keeping animals.GMP said he has been on restricted duties since the incident was reported and investigated by West Yorkshire Police.",
        "Following an independent disciplinary panel at GMP Force Headquarters on yesterday, May 2, he admitted gross misconduct and was dismissed without notice.Chief Superintendent Michael Allen, Head of GMP's Professional Standards Branch, said: 'GMP expects the highest standards of conduct from its officers, both on and off duty, and Dunn's actions clearly fell far short of these standards.'The vast majority of police officers and staff fulfil their duties in serving the public to the highest standard and demonstrate exemplary behaviour in their private lives.'Public trust and confidence in the police is vital and GMP does not underestimate the importance of officers and staff demonstrating the highest standards of professional behaviour towards not only members of the public but also to animals.'",
        "Chief Supt Allen added: 'Having a criminal conviction for animal cruelty makes Dunn wholly unsuitable to continue serving as a police officer and his cruelty towards Frank the dog is ultimately why he has lost his job.'Dunn's actions, which have rightly been condemned by the public and his colleagues, bring the profession into disrepute and damage the confidence the public has in police officers.'I would like to thank West Yorkshire Police, who investigated this case criminally, and, working with the Crown Prosecution Service, secured the conviction at criminal court.'GMP's Professional Standards Branch has a responsibility to hold policing to account, taking action where misconduct is identified, and under new management this work is now accelerating, focusing both on legacy cases and new reports.'",
        "In the shocking video, which appears to have been recorded by a neighbour, a man can be heard shouting inside a house before Dunn storms into the garden and punches the cowering dog.\u00a0The pup can be heard yelping several times as Dunn continues to deliver blows to it.At court in 2021, it was heard that Dunn had been drinking when the offence took place.Prosecutor Charles MacRae said Dunn could be heard shouting and swearing at the puppy.Dunn's defence said he 'unreservedly accepted the allegations' and that it was an isolated incident.",
        "Paul Forster, the chairman of the independent panel, said the decision had been reached to 'maintain public confidence in the police service'.He added: 'Hearings like this are about the individual but also about much more, with bigger and wider considerations in play. Therefore, the most appropriate outcome is dismissal without notice.'"
