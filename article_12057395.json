        "Sophie, 58, was beaming with joy as she threw her hands into the air when the performer took to the stage and sang his hit tune 'All Night Long' and 'Easy Like Sunday Morning.'Take That, Katy Perry, and others will be taking to the stage in Windsor for a musical extravaganza following the King's Coronation yesterday.Earlier today, Sophie, and her husband\u00a0Duke of Edinburgh, 59, attended a Big Lunch event in Cranleigh, Surrey.Their visit came after the Duke and Duchess made a regal appearance at the Coronation of King Charles III and Queen Camilla yesterday.

        "More than 18 million people in the UK tuned in to watch the ceremony on TV, compared with 26.5 million for the late Queen's funeral in September.After the ceremony, the\u00a0family appeared on the Buckingham Palace balcony with a select group of senior royals as The Mall was swamped by tens of thousands of cheering supporters.Lady Louise and James stood beside their royal parents as they waved to crowds before a RAF flypast, which had to be scaled back to just helicopters and the Red Arrows because of the heavy rain in London.Over the last two years, Lady Louise has taken on an increasingly public role as her parents Prince Edward and Sophie have been bumped up the royal food chain following the disgrace of Prince Andrew and the departure of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.\u00a0She was front and centre in the Platinum Jubilee celebrations, joined her parents at the Commonwealth Games and made her successful TV debut in a documentary about her beloved grandfather the Duke of Edinburgh.",
