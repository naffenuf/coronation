        "Richard Taylor has signed a new deal at St Mirren, keeping him at the club until the summer of 2025.",
        "The 22-year-old defender initially joined\u00a0the Buddies on a six-month deal in January, with the Paisley club holding the option to extend further which has now been taken up.Taylor signed for Saints after leaving League of Ireland First Division side Waterford and made his debut in a 1-1 draw with Hearts on January 7.He has gone on to make eight first-team appearances so far this season, and boss Stephen Robinson told the club\u2019s website: \u201cRichard has come in and been fantastic in the games he has played.\u201cHe\u2019s stepped up to the level in games against Celtic and Hearts, and in the longer term, I think he\u2019s a very good addition to our squad.\u201cHe\u2019s someone we are constantly working on, he\u2019s someone who wants to learn and he\u2019s still only young.",
        "\u201cHe\u2019s left-footed which gives us more balance on that side of defence and he can play at left-back as well.\u201cHe\u2019s 6ft 2ins and he\u2019s quick as well as being very composed on the ball and going forward he gives us a few more options playing out from the back.\u201d"
