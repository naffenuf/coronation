        "MOSCOW, May 5 (Reuters) - the Kremlin said on Friday that the transfer of the Russian assets of the Finnish energy company Fortum to Moscow's control was in line with the law and was necessary to defend Russia's interests.",
        "Fortum earlier on Friday said it had formally notified the Kremlin of its strong objection to the seizure, which it called \"unlawful.\"Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in a call that the transfer also reflected similar moves against Russia by \"unfriendly\" countries - those that have imposed sanctions in response to Moscow's actions in Ukraine.
