Unite has given Heathrow Airport every opportunity to make an improved pay offer, which could have led to the strike action being suspended  Wayne King, Unite  Talks at the conciliation service Acas failed to resolve the row, said Unite.The union\u2019s regional co-ordinating officer Wayne King said: \u201cUnite has given Heathrow Airport every opportunity to make an improved pay offer, which could have led to the strike action being suspended.\u201cSadly, they refused to grasp the opportunity to make an offer which could meet members\u2019 expectations.\u201d",
        " We have asked for the independent and specialist support of Acas to chair further talks with unions and find a resolution  Heathrow spokesperson  A Heathrow spokesperson said: \u201cPassengers can be reassured that they will travel as normal. This is an important time for the country, and we will not let these unnecessary strikes disrupt journeys.\u201cWe have activated our contingency plans and deployed 750 additional colleagues and the entire management team who will be on hand in the terminals providing assistance to passengers.\u201cThe majority of colleagues do not support strike action. Colleagues could have an inflation-matching pay increase for two years \u2013 10% this year and a CPI-linked increase in 2024, as well as a \u00a31,150 lump sum but instead they\u2019re left empty-handed by Unite\u2019s refusal to allow members to vote on the offer.",
        "\u201cWe have therefore asked for the independent and specialist support of Acas to chair further talks with unions and find a resolution.\u201d"
