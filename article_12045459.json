I personally have a lot of respect and admiration for her. Why would I not?'\u00a0Meeting the family\u00a0Taylor has a fan in the form of Matt's famous mother Denise Welch, who recently shared a snap of the pair cuddled up.\u00a0The\u00a0Loose Women star, 64, beamed broadly as she posed for pictures Taylor while\u00a0backstage at a The 1975 gig in London's O2 in January.\u00a0Denise couldn't wipe the smile off her face as she penned: 'Oh what a night at a sold out 02.

It was for reasons that are not to be criticised. She's amazing.'\u00a0Taylor also made a surprise appearance at The 1975 gig in January when she performed her chart-topping hit Anti-Hero for the first time.\u00a0",

        "And in 2021, Taylor hinted that she and Jonas were back on civil terms during another appearance on Ellen's Burning Questions segment.The star was asked what the most rebellious thing she did as a teenager was, which caused Taylor to laugh.'Probably when I like put Joe Jonas on blast on your show,' she began.

He went everywhere he could to see her, but she didn't travel much to see him,' a source told Us Weekly at the time.

        "The tune gave insight on how Taylor and John's reported romance went wrong, with the singer singing in tune: 'Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone/ Don't you think I was too young to be messed with / The girl in the dress cried the whole way home.'She also wrote the lyrics: 'Well maybe it's me / And my blind optimism to blame / Or maybe it's you and your sick need / To give love and take it away.'Dear John, I see it all now, it was wrong / Don't you think nineteen's too young / To be played by your dark, twisted games.'He added more fuel to the fire two years after the songs release when he told Rolling Stone magazine that he felt 'really humiliated' about the song, which 'made' him 'feel terrible.'October - December 2010: JAKE GYLLENHAAL\u00a0",

I don't know,' he told Howard Stern in 2015.",
        "The song would have firmly been in Swift's past had it not been for the drama with her masters. In 2009, after Scooter Braun purchased her masters, Swift accused him of exerting 'tyrannical control' over her music, and the two had a bitter feud in the press.At the urging of fans, Swift began rerecording all of the songs for which he owned the masters, which she has started to release \u2014 including several never-before-released tracks on each one.She released a 10-minute long, deeply personal version of All Too Well, which offered added new dramatic details in recounting their romance, singing that she was in 'hell' and felt 'shame.'Most damning, though were revelations that Gyllenhaal told Swift the problem was their age difference.July- October 2012: CONNOR KENNEDY\u00a0",

I figure if you're happy in your new relationship you should focus on that instead of trying to tear your ex bf down for something to do.\u00a0'I know you're off tour and you need someone new to try and bury like Katy [Perry] ETC but I'm not that guy, sorry. I won't allow it. Please focus on the positive aspects of YOUR life because you've earned a great one. God bless everyone have a beautiful day.'Calvin later admitted 'all hell broke loose' when he split from Taylor.",
        "He told GQ: 'It's very difficult when something I consider so personal plays out very publicly.

She respected my feelings in that sense. I'm not good at being a celebrity.'He continued: 'But when it ended, all hell broke loose. Now I see that Twitter thing as a result of me succumbing to pressure. It took me a minute to realize that none of that matters. I'm a positive guy. For both of us it was the wrong situation.
