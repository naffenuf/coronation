        "Justin Welby has given himself top billing at the Coronation.\u00a0The Archbishop of Canterbury will deliver a coronation sermon, the first since Randall Davidson preached at the crowning of George V in 1911.\u00a0He will also be one of just two people allowed to pay personal homage to King Charles. The other is Prince William.\u00a0And he has introduced a ritual which sees the King welcomed by a \u2018young person\u2019 on entering the Abbey. His Majesty will reply by humbly comparing himself to Jesus.\u00a0This was a novelty the prelate introduced when he was enthroned ten years ago at Canterbury Cathedral.\u00a0He was greeted by a \u2018young\u2019 member of the congregation, and told her: \u2018I am Justin, a servant of Jesus Christ.\u2019 Has he turned the crowning into the Justin Welby Show?",
        "The problem of how to anoint Camilla without messing-up her hairdo has been resolved with a bit of traditional Anglican fudge.\u00a0At the 1937 anointing of the Queen Mother, the order of service noted \u2018the Archbishop shall pour the Holy Oil upon the Crown of her Head\u2019. However, on Saturday, the order of service says that \u2018the Queen is anointed on the forehead\u2019.Have the Just Stop Oil boobies been in touch?Historian Kate Williams warns BBC Radio 2 listeners King Charles will depart Westminster Abbey wearing the Imperial State Crown which \u2018weighs a ton\u2019.\u00a0But Kate cautions that Charles will earlier don the even heavier St Edward\u2019s Crown, warning: \u2018It weighs nearly five pounds, so it\u2019s really the size of a newborn baby. So you are walking around with a baby on your head!\u2019 Perish the thought!",
        "BBC\u2019S Nick Beake excitedly reports on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that president Macron was met a by a \u2018chorus of whistles\u2019 and forest of red cards at Saturday\u2019s French Cup Final. Quoi?\u00a0Paris media described the footie protest as a flop, with barely a card or whistle around.\u00a0The live TV commentator noted at the very 49th minute when the protest was supposed to peak: \u2018The game is deemed to be more important.\u2019 Specsavers, Nick?No love lost between Jamie Oliver and restaurant critic Jay Rayner, with the latter raising an eyebrow at Jamie\u2019s plan for a new nosherie at Theatre Royal Drury Lane \u2013 four years after the collapse of his restaurant group resulted in the loss of around 1,000 jobs.\u00a0\u2018I can only assume that every single supplier, (including HMRC/ HSBC) who was owed money, has been paid out,\u2019 tweets Rayner, adding waspishly: \u2018Of course you\u2019d make sure of that before you opened a new restaurant, wouldn\u2019t you.\u2019",
