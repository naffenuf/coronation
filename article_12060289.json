        "The act of protest by the EU\u2019s delegation to Israel against a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government, the most religious and ultranationalist in the country\u2019s history, could cause a diplomatic spat between Israel and the EU.Relations have already been strained over Israeli policies in the occupied West Bank.Itamar Ben-Gvir, the leader of the Jewish Power faction, serves as the national security minister and was assigned to represent the Israeli government at the EU\u2019s Europe Day event on Tuesday. It's a shame that the EU, which pretends to represent democratic values and multiculturalism, behaves with undiplomatic gagging  Israel's national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir  Foreign minister Eli Cohen said on Sunday in a Kan radio interview that Mr Ben-Gvir had been assigned by the government secretary to attend \u201cnot as a representative of the Jewish Power party \u2026 but to represent the government of Israel\u201d.The EU said it decided \u201cto cancel the diplomatic reception, as we do not want to offer a platform to someone whose views contradict the values the European Union stands for\u201d.",
        "The remainder of the public event would take place as scheduled.Mr Ben-Gvir is a former far-right activist and hard-line West Bank settler who has been convicted of incitement and support for a Jewish terror group.",
        "As the government\u2019s representative at the Europe Day event, Mr Ben-Gvir would have addressed attendees.\u201cIt\u2019s a shame that the EU, which pretends to represent democratic values and multiculturalism, behaves with undiplomatic gagging,\u201d Mr Ben-Gvir said.Mr Netanyahu returned to office in December at the head of a coalition that includes ultra-Orthodox parties and religious ultranationalists, including Mr Ben-Gvir\u2019s small Jewish Power faction.The government has put expansion of West Bank settlements as a top priority.The EU, along with most of the international community, considers Jewish settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem illegal under international law and obstacles to peace with the Palestinians.Israel captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip in the 1967 Middle East war. The Palestinians seek all three areas for a future independent state."
