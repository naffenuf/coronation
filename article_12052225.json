        "The pair coupled-up during this winter's series but left the season just days before the final.They decided to go their separate ways just a few weeks after arriving back in the UK,\u00a0with some programme fans accusing them of having a showmance.However, Maxwell, 24, insisted they simply drifted apart once they returned from South Africa, where the show was filmed, insisting 'other things' took his attention away from their union.He told the\u00a0Murad Merali Podcast: 'The main thing I would say with the whole situation, when you're in the villa and even just after the villa but you're still in South Africa together, it's a very different environment.",
        "'All that you have to focus on in that period of time is each other and kind of just being on holiday together and it's kind of easy to have a great time when you're on holiday.'But once you come back home and there are all these other things going on that then take your attention and take your focus.'Maxwell added that he wasn't sure he saw the pair together far in the future, explaining: 'It really gives you the opportunity to look at it and think is there really longevity in this situation or is it that we've connected and really got on but outside in the real world we're just not too sure if it has that same longevity to it.'",
        "It comes after Maxwell and Olivia, 27, became the second couple from this year's winter series to break up just weeks after leaving the villa in March.The ring girl and the finance student were said to have gone their separate ways after 'naturally drifting apart'.It came after Casey O'Gorman and Rosie Seabrook became the first couple from the 2023 winter series to split up.Olivia and Maxwell reportedly had a conversation about their relationship and decided to split up, but remain on 'good terms'.A source told The Sun: 'Although it was rumoured they'd already split they only had a proper chat about where their relationship was going yesterday, and they both agreed the writing was on the wall.",
        "'They had fun while it lasted, and there are no hard feelings at all, but he obviously went to Mexico, and Olivia has been focusing on work projects. They have naturally drifted apart.'The couple were dumped from the South African villa shortly before the grand final and left the show as a couple, later appearing together on the reunion show.Just days before their split,\u00a0Olivia denied she and Maxwell had secretly gone their separate ways, insisting that they were 'literally fine'.She told FUBAR Radio: 'We are absolutely fine.\u00a0Even though I've been on the show, I am still a private person. I'm not the sort of person to upload every single thing that we're doing. We went out for lunch the other day.'"
