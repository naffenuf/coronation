        "New sections of the Roman 'Riverside Wall' by the Thames have been uncoveredThis wall completes the perimeter of the inland 'London Wall', built in 200 ADIt is thought to have protected the city from uprisings, and establish its status\u00a0Archaeologists have uncovered three new sections of an ancient Roman wall that was built along the River Thames the best part of 2,000 years ago.",
        "Known as the 'Riverside Wall', it once completed the perimeter of the more famous 'London Wall' that extends around the centre of the city inland.The barricade is thought to have been constructed to protect London - or 'Londinium', as it was known at the time - from\u00a0uprisings by local tribes.The newly-excavated sections of the Riverside Wall are located by\u00a0Riverbank House on\u00a0Upper Thames Street, and\u00a0Sugar Quay and\u00a0Three Quays on\u00a0Lower Thames Street.In total, they make up about 330 feet (100 m) of the nearly 6,000-foot-long (1,800 m) wall which sealed off London from the Thames.\u00a0",
        "They were first discovered between 2006 and 2016 during redevelopments along Upper and Lower Thames Street by the\u00a0Museum of London Archaeology (MOLA).",
        "The London Wall is a defensive wall built by the Romans around the settlement of Londinium in the late 2nd or early 3rd century AD.\u00a0The wall was constructed of Kentish ragstone and was up to 20 feet (6 m) high and 10 feet (3 m) thick in some places.\u00a0It originally extended for around 2 miles (3.1 km) and enclosed an area of approximately 330 acres.\u00a0The London Wall was designed to protect the city against attacks from the north and was augmented by defensive gates, towers and ditches.During the medieval period, the wall was rebuilt and strengthened with additional towers and gatehouses.Today, some parts of the wall are still visible, including the remains of the gatehouses and towers, which have been incorporated into modern buildings.",
        "Now, they have been added to the National Heritage List for England as scheduled monuments, as confirmed by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport with Historic England.Duncan Wilson, the chief executive of Historic England, said: 'Even in a really dense city like London, built up over 2000 years, there are still mysteries to be revealed right beneath our feet.\u00a0'The riverside wall remains an intriguing element of Roman London which raises almost as many questions as it answers.'The Riverside Wall would have severed London's connection\u00a0to the wharves and warehouses of the quayside.Mr Wilson says this suggests that the anxious Romans were prioritising defence over trade during a 'time of uncertainty' throughout the wider Roman Empire.He added: 'By adding these sites to the National Heritage List we recognise their national significance, and can closely manage their conservation so that they remain part of London's rich story.'The London Wall was constructed of Kentish ragstone brought over from Maidstone, and was up to 20 feet (6 m) high and 10 feet (3 m) thick in some places.\u00a0It originally extended for around 2 miles (3.1 km) and enclosed an area of approximately 330 acres, but much of it has been destroyed over the last 1,700 years as the city has grown.",
        "As well as protection - with the Riverside Wall, it forms a defensive ring around the whole city - the wall may have helped reinforce the status of\u00a0Londinium.\u00a0Some parts of the Riverside Wall incorporate\u00a0reused monumental masonry and demonstrate ancient Roman construction techniques, so improve our understanding of architecture during this period.",
        "The section of the Riverside Wall under\u00a0Riverbank House is about 66 feet (20 m) long and up to 4.6 feet (1.4 m) high.Archaeologists also discovered the remains of some\u00a0timber Roman quays that were\u00a0used for loading and unloading boats.About 148 feet (45 m) of the wall was found below\u00a0Sugar Quay, as well as some quayside structures dating from\u00a0the late 1st century and later Medieval period.Finally, 115 feet (35 m) was excavated at\u00a0Three Quays, as well as\u00a0wooden piles made of reused\u00a0wooden cornice or pediment from a building.All three sections of the Riverside Wall have been left in-situ underground, beneath modern buildings.These well-preserved wooden\u00a0wharf and quay structures from the\u00a0Roman and Medieval periods have also been granted protection.",
        "55BC - Julius Caesar crossed the channel with around 10,000 soldiers. They landed at a Pegwell Bay on the Isle of Thanet and were met by a force of Britons. Caesar was forced to withdraw.54BC - Caesar crossed the channel again in his second attempt to conquer Britain. He came with with 27,000 infantry and cavalry and landed at Deal but were unopposed. They marched inland and after hard battles they defeated the Britons and key tribal leaders surrendered.However, later that year, Caesar was forced to return to Gaul to deal with problems there and the Romans left.54BC - 43BC - Although there were no Romans present in Britain during these years, their influence increased due to trade links.43AD - A Roman force of 40,000 led by Aulus Plautius landed in Kent and took the south east. The emperor Claudius appointed Plautius as Governor of Britain and returned to Rome.47AD - Londinium (London) was founded and Britain was declared part of the Roman empire. Networks of roads were built across the country.50AD - Romans arrived in the southwest and made their mark in the form of a wooden fort on a hill near the river Exe.\u00a0\u00a0A town was created at the site of the fort decades later and names Isca.\u00a0When Romans let and Saxons ruled, all ex-Roman towns were called a 'ceaster'. this was called 'Exe ceaster' and a merger of this eventually gave rise to Exeter.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a075 - 77AD - Romans defeated the last resistant tribes, making all Britain Roman. Many Britons started adopting Roman customs and law.122AD - Emperor Hadrian ordered that a wall be built between England and Scotland to keep Scottish tribes out.312AD - Emperor Constantine made Christianity legal throughout the Roman empire.228AD - The Romans were being attacked by barbarian tribes and soldiers stationed in the country started to be recalled to Rome.410AD - All Romans were recalled to Rome and Emperor Honorious told Britons they no longer had a connection to Rome.Source: History on the net"
