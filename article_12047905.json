There is no official delegation, per the White House.'There is no official U.S. delegation. Finnegan is a plus one,' the East Wing said in a statement.

I think it's very disrespectful for him not to be here,' Trump said in an interview with British commentator\u00a0Nigel Farage.",
        "'I don't think he can do it physically, actually. I think it's hard for him to do it physically,' Trump said. 'Certainly, he should be here. He's our representative of our country.'\u00a0President Biden did accept an invitation from the King for a state visit to the UK. No date has been set for that visit, however.\u00a0",

        "On Saturday, she'll be at the coronation in the morning and, in the evening, she'll attend a reception hosted by U.S. Ambassador Jane Hartley.\u00a0On Sunday, Jill Biden\u00a0will attend a Coronation Big Lunch hosted by Sunak and Murty at No. 10 Downing Street. She returns to Washington D.C. in the evening.\u00a0Charles plans for a more toned-down coronation compared to his mother's, Queen Elizabeth II,\u00a0in June 1953.The ceremony will be shorter than his mother's three-hour extravaganza and no more than 2,800 guests in the audience - far fewer than the 8,000 who assembled to see Elizabeth crowned.\u00a0During the service conducted by the archbishop of Canterbury, Charles will be anointed with oil, receive the traditional symbols of the monarch - including the orb and scepter - and have the St. Edwards Crown placed on his head for the first time.\u00a0His wife Camilla will be crowned as queen consort.\u00a0",
        "Additionally new research has revealed how the first lady and the king are distant cousins.Both are descended from 16th century noble couple Philippe III de Cro\u00ff and his wife Johanna. They are 13th cousins once removed.Philippe III, who died in 1595, served as a knight under Spain's King Philip II, the husband of Queen Mary who sent the Spanish Armada to invade England in 1588.\u00a0"
