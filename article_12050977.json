        "\u00a0Follow all the latest news and updates on the Coronation and everything royal on our live blog hereThe wives of Joe Biden and Rishi Sunak were all smiles as they met at Downing Street today ahead of the King's Coronation.",
        "Jill Biden was dressed in pink as she shook hands with\u00a0Akshata Murty on the steps of No 10 as she represents the US President at Charles' historic ceremony this weekend.The First Lady and Prime Minister's wife met veterans and visited a local school before they are due to meet US Embassy staff in Vauxhall. Mrs Biden will later meet King Charles, her 13th cousin once removed, at a reception in Buckingham Palace.President Biden has faced some criticism, notably from his predecessor and potential 2024 election rival Donald Trump, for skipping Charles' coronation.At the last such event, when Charles' late mother Elizabeth was crowned in 1953, then US President Dwight Eisenhower sent a delegation of envoys to represent him.The White House said last month President Biden had told Charles he wanted to meet the King in Britain at a future date. President Biden visited Belfast and Ireland last month to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement.",
        "In a boxing session in the pillared room in Downing Street, the pair\u00a0were introduced by Veterans Minister Johnny Mercer to former Lance Corporal Maurillia Simpson.\u00a0Mr Mercer helped Ms Simpson, who has won a gold medal at the Invictus Games, out of her wheelchair so she could stand and talk with the two women - before the three of them helped her back into her chair.",
        "The US ambassador to Britain Jane Hartley also attended the session organised by The Fighting Chance boxing club.Mrs Biden and Ms\u00a0Murty then\u00a0joined primary school children in Borough while they were enjoying a coronation-themed lunch.They sat down at a table with the Charles Dickens primary school children, who were wearing paper crowns and eating sandwiches and cakes, to talk with them about Saturday's service.Mrs Biden told the children about her own career as a teacher and asked if they were enjoying their food.Before getting up to leave, the First Lady, who is set to attend the Westminster Abbey event, told the pupils: 'Nice to see you all, have fun tomorrow, I'll be thinking about all of you.'",
        "The pair later visited a Y6 music lesson where they listened to pupils use guitars, a cello and double bass to perform Lovely, a song by American artist Billie Eilish.After the performance, Mrs Biden said: 'This was a treat, thank you so much. Thank you for sharing your talent with us.'It comes as new research has revealed how Mrs Biden and King Charles are distant cousins. The monarch and Mrs Biden both descend from 16th century noble couple Philippe III de Cro\u00ff and his wife Johanna. They are 13th cousins once removed.",
        "Philippe III, who died in 1595, served as a knight under Spain's King Philip II, the husband of Queen Mary who sent the Spanish Armada to invade England in 1588.The research by genealogy website MyHeritage has also shown that the King is a 12th cousin of Canadian PM Justin Trudeau, who will also be at the Coronation.The King and Mrs Biden are both the 13th generation descending from De Cro\u00ff.\u00a0The 'once removed' element of their connection refers to the number of generations that separate them.A first cousin once removed would refer to a cousin who is of your parents' generation.\u00a0\u00a0De Cro\u00ff, who was also the Stadtholder - or steward - of Flanders in Belgium, had daughters Anne and Marguerite with his wife.\u00a0Charles is directly descended from Anne, whilst Mrs Biden descends from Marguerite."
