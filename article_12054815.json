        "Addressing his jubilant supporters in the Kent district of Medway \u2013 which had just elected a Labour council for the first time in 20 years \u2013 Sir Keir Starmer crowed: \u2018We are on course for a Labour majority at the next General Election!\u2019",
        "They\u2019re not. A rigorous analysis of the numbers suggests Britain is actually heading for a hung Parliament. And catastrophe.Be clear, Thursday\u2019s results were a disaster for the Conservatives. As the polls narrowed over the past few weeks, Tory MPs began to convince themselves there was a chance they could turn their political fortunes around and pull off a stunning electoral comeback.Now those hopes have been shattered. Darlington. Tamworth. Windsor. Dover. The Red Wall, Blue Wall and just about everything in between is crumbling.It\u2019s not hard to see why.The Prime Minister has promised delivery. No 10\u2019s mantra is \u2018Rishi identifies a problem, he focuses on it, then he fixes it\u2019. But in the days leading up to the local elections, the struggles faced by most voters seemed all too familiar. Nurses\u2019 strikes. Spiralling food inflation. Five hundred and thirty-five new small boat arrivals.",
        "There was another stark revelation for embattled Tory councillors and MPs. Rishi Sunak isn\u2019t the asset on the doorsteps they hoped he would be, or need him to be.Last week, in Stockton-on-Tees \u2013 just half a mile from the factory where engineering workers in hard-hats unveiled their iconic \u2018We Love Boris\u2019 election placard \u2013 I chatted to a man who used to run a local market stall.",
        "\u2018Sunak doesn\u2019t have Boris\u2019s personality,\u2019 he told me. \u2018He can\u2019t connect in the same way. People round here knew Boris had his faults, but at least they felt they knew him.\u2019Labour\u2019s ruthless attack machine was effective at exploiting this disconnect. In the final few weeks of the campaign, it dropped its disgusting attempt to claim the Prime Minister was soft on paedophiles and began to paint him as being \u2018out of touch\u2019 instead. And the strategy worked.From the industrial North East to the market towns of the South East, the message was the same: Sunak is rich. His wife is rich. They don\u2019t understand the lives of working men and women.Against this backdrop, Labour should be surging towards a 1997-style landslide. But something is holding the party back. And that something is Sir Keir Starmer.",
        "Outside a polling booth in Stevenage, I asked Francis Taylor if she was aware she represented the key demographic \u2013 Stevenage Woman \u2013 that Starmer believes he must capture if he\u2019s to secure a majority. \u2018Well, then he\u2019s going to have to work on it a little bit more,\u2019 she told me laughing. \u2018He\u2019s not consistent enough. He\u2019s always confronting the Tories on their policies, but he\u2019s not telling us what he\u2019d do that\u2019s any different.\u2019",
        "It\u2019s a view that again is echoed across the country. People are trying to give Labour\u2019s leader a hearing. But all they\u2019re currently receiving in response is a vague commitment to not be another Jeremy Corbyn.Which is in turn opening the door to the real Jeremy Corbyn. Or at least, the 20 to 30 of his allies currently lurking on the Labour backbenches. Looking at last week\u2019s results \u2013 48 lost Tory councils, and more than 1,000 defeated councillors \u2013 it is almost impossible to see how Sunak can transform his party\u2019s fortunes to the point where it can win an overall majority in just over a year\u2019s time.And any outcome that leaves the Conservatives short of a majority effectively hands the keys of Downing Street to Sir Keir Starmer.But it\u2019s becoming equally difficult to see how Starmer advances from here to secure his own majority.A significant number of Tory supporters sat on their hands on Thursday.History tells us that oppositions traditionally over-perform in local elections \u2013 where people feel emboldened to express a protest \u2013 then fall back at the subsequent General Election.And though Labour is triumphant, its gain of around 550 seats was well short of the benchmark of 700 psephologists had identified as the minimum required to enable it to be confident of even being the largest party in a future House of Commons.",
        "Which means a hung Parliament, or a Parliament in which Sir Keir only secures a slender majority, is the nightmare scenario now facing the nation. In that instance, the balance of power would fall instantly into the hands of the Nat Pack \u2013 an unholy alliance of SNP MPs and vengeful Corbynites.\u2018A Labour minority government in a hung Parliament would be a good result,\u2019 leading Corbynite commentator Owen Jones claimed, as the full implications of the result became apparent.\u2018It\u2019s increasingly clear that the SNP can hold the balance of power after the next Election \u2013 putting Scotland in prime position to pull the strings of a minority UK government,\u2019 boasted Stephen Flynn, the SNP leader at Westminster.He\u2019s right. In a hung Parliament, Prime Minister Starmer would become nothing more than a marionette, dancing a maniacal jig to whatever radical tune the Nationalists and Corbynites opted to play.",
        "Some on the liberal Left claim that at that moment the Lib Dems would ride to the country\u2019s rescue. Indeed, many positively relish the prospect of finally securing their longed-for Progressive Realignment. But it\u2019s hard to see how a new Lib-Lab pact would be sustainable. The Lib Dems are still suffering post-traumatic stress disorder from their stint in coalition from 2010 to 2015. They have already ruled out a formal coalition. And they are not going to align themselves with a single contentious policy that would risk a repeat of the tuition fees fiasco.",
        "So which pet Lib Dem policy would be the price for propping up Prime Minister Starmer and his administration day-to-day? \u00a330 billion for a universal basic income? The abolition of mandatory prison sentences for possession of acid and knives? Or the real prize \u2013 their pledge to \u2018work to create the conditions through which the UK is able to join the EU once again\u2019.Over the past few years, the British people have found themselves lashed to the lead car of a political and economic rollercoaster. The parliamentary Brexit paralysis. Covid. The cost-of-living catastrophe. Industrial chaos. Putin\u2019s nuclear adventurism. The Truss fiasco. The small boats crisis. And they want it to stop.Labour. Tory. They don\u2019t care who delivers it.They crave stability. A respite from the chaos and uncertainty that seems to have become our natural national state.But based on Thursday\u2019s results, they aren\u2019t going to get it.\u2018We\u2019re on course for a Labour majority!\u2019 Sir Keir Starmer proclaimed. No. After these results, what Britain is actually heading towards is political anarchy."
