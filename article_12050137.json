        "She continued: 'I was talking to Biggins the other day and he reminded me about the time we got trapped on an island in Corfu with Stella and no water.'Ben quipped that she could write another memoir with more of her wild stories in it but she replied:\u00a0'No! It's in there now! I had to change it.'It comes after Joan gushed about her Damehood the day before she met with Charles in 2015.She said:\u00a0'Only one more day before my investiture as Dame !
