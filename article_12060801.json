        "Newly released court documents in the Idaho murder case revealed that during a search of Bryan Kohberger\u2019s apartment, investigators discovered traces of blood in his bedroom and uncovered a previously unknown storage unit belonging to the murder suspect.\u00a0",
        "According to the new documents, when police approached the storage closet belonging to Kohberger - nearly two months after the quarduple homicide of Kaylee Goncalves, Madison Mogen, Ethan Chapin and Xana Kernodle -\u00a0 it was unlocked, the door was \u2018ajar'. Cops reported that it was dusty with \u2018cobwebs\u2019.No trace evidence was taken and police didn't believe Kohberger had used it 'recently,' but the unit's existence may still provide a big lead for law enforcement.\u00a0It's plausible that Kohberger may have accessed the unit weeks earlier, closer to the time when the murders took place.It appears that investigators considered the possibility that a storage closet would be a convenient place to temporarily stash the alleged murder weapon or the clothes police believe the suspect wore at the time of the murders.\u00a0There is no indication in the documents that Kohberger did either of these, but law enforcement is likely running down that lead.\u00a0The blood samples found in the apartment were preliminarily tested on the scene before being taken to the crime lab for further analysis.Meanwhile, Kohberger and his team are busy mounting a legal defense, suggesting he will plead not guilty at his upcoming preliminary hearing.\u00a0In recent court documents, the suspect demanded the State turn over evidence that his defense claims could prove the innocence, including body and dash cam footage from officers involved in his arrest and lab reports from the forensic evidence seized at his parents' home and his Hyundai Elantra."
