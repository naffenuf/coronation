        "A British Red Cross volunteer who will form part of the guard of honour during the coronation has said it will be the \u201cicing on the cake\u201d for her own 60th birthday celebrations.",
        "Irene Guild, 59, from Leven in Fife, has already made the journey to London, and she told the PA news agency: \u201cYou can feel the atmosphere as soon as you get off the plane.\u201cThe people milling around Westminster, (they all want to take) photographs.\u201dHaving volunteered for the Red Cross for 10 years, the coronation will be Mrs Guild\u2019s sixth royal occasion, and it comes days before her birthday on Tuesday.She decided to work with the organisation following the death of her son as a way to support people and communities.",
        "She said it is \u201cnice\u201d that she has been able to witness the transition from one monarch to the next.\u201cI\u2019m seeing two ends of the scale, the very sad side of things and the very happy side of things for the public,\u201d she said.\u201cThe public have come together on both occasions really well.\u201dMrs Guild also worked tirelessly to deliver food and medicine to people unable to leave their homes during the Covid-19 pandemic.She was selected to be involved in the coronation alongside 21 other volunteers, and said it is an \u201cabsolute honour\u201d. We\u2019re incredibly proud of these three exceptional volunteers and delighted their work is being recognised  Rob Murray, Red Cross Scotland  ",
        "She added: \u201cI\u2019m just so ecstatic to be asked and given the opportunity. For me, it\u2019s like winning the lottery.\u201dMrs Guild was on hand to help a woman who took ill at the late Queen\u2019s lying-in-state at St Giles\u2019 Cathedral in Edinburgh last year.\u201cI just gently walked up behind a lady looking very unwell, put my arm around and put my other hand on her elbow and I went \u2018I\u2019ve got you, you\u2019re okay\u2019.\u201cI found a chair, out of line from the cameras so nobody could see her, and we got some water, took her thick coat off, which she had been wearing in the heat.\u201cI basically got everything off and took her outside. When I sat her down she said \u2018How did you know?\u2019 I said I could just tell.\u201cI\u2019d watched the blood drain away from her face and could see she was pasty and sweating. I knew if I hadn\u2019t caught her, she was going to hit the concrete floor.\u201d",
        "Two other Scottish Red Cross volunteers, from the Highlands and Shetland, will also take part in the ceremony and for Mrs Guild, it will be the perfect early birthday celebration.\u201cThat\u2019s a wee bit of icing on the cake (when people ask) \u2018what did you do for your 60th?\u2019,\u201d she said.",
        "\u201cWell, I went to see Charles.\u201dRob Murray, director of Red Cross Scotland, said: \u201cWe\u2019re incredibly proud of these three exceptional volunteers and delighted their work is being recognised.\u201cOur volunteers play a crucial role helping us to support people in crisis across Scotland, whether that\u2019s welcoming refugees fleeing conflict, supporting families who have lost their homes to floods or fires, or training people in life-saving first aid techniques.\u201cIt never ceases to amaze me how dedicated our Scottish volunteers are, helping people whenever and wherever they are needed.\u201d"
