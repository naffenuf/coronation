        "Humza Yousaf has dismissed Alex Salmond\u2019s suggestion that police should have been used to prevent the Stone of Destiny being moved from Edinburgh Castle.",
        "The First Minister said the ancient stone is \u201call (Mr Salmond\u2019s) been talking about\u201d recently.The Alba Party leader had said that Scottish police should have staged a \u201cstandoff\u201d outside Edinburgh Castle, preventing the historic artefact from being moved to London for the King\u2019s coronation.He said such a move could have been used as a bargaining tool in the push for a second independence referendum.",
        "The stone was taken to London last week to be used in the coronation, with Mr Yousaf attending a ceremony during which it was removed from its resting place at Edinburgh Castle.The stone has been used to crown monarchs of Scotland \u2013 and later the UK \u2013 in a tradition dating back centuries.Mr Yousaf was asked about the former first minister\u2019s comments as he spoke to journalists at an anti-poverty summit in Edinburgh on Wednesday.He said: \u201cAlex Salmond should remember of course that operational matters are for Police Scotland.\u201cIt\u2019s not for the First Minister to tell the police what to do, but of course it wouldn\u2019t have been the right thing to do even if those powers did exist.\u201cAlex Salmond can sit there and talk about the Stone of Destiny all day long.",
        "\u201cIt seems it\u2019s all he\u2019s been talking about over the last few weeks.",
        "\u201cI\u2019m committed to talking about reducing poverty, the cost-of-living crisis, investing in our public services.\u201dMr Salmond, a former SNP leader who is now a vocal critic of the party, said he would be speaking at a pro-independence rally on Saturday \u2013 the day of the coronation.He told Andrew Marr on Tuesday: \u201cYou don\u2019t command very much as first minister\u00a0of\u00a0Scotland, but you do command the Scottish police force, you could have put a ring\u00a0of\u00a0policemen around Edinburgh Castle.\u201cHave a standoff on the Esplanade and politely explain to the world that Scotland should not sacrifice its symbol of sovereignty until that sovereignty is at least recognised by Westminster.\u201d"
