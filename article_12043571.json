        "First time in history an Earl of Carnarvon not invited to crowning of a monarchLord Carnarvon sat behind Charles at Queen's committal service after funeralGuest list has been cut from 8,000 invited for Queen\u2019s coronation to just 2,000Lord and Lady Carnarvon have not decided where they will be on Coronation day \u2013 either at their magnificent Highclere Castle estate or with their family in\u00a0London.",
        "What seems certain, though, is that \u2013 along with some of the grandest families in the land \u2013 they will not be at Westminster Abbey to watch Charles crowned King.\u2018No one\u2019s sent me an email or [made] a phone call saying, \u201cYou\u2019re not coming.\u201d We just haven\u2019t received anything,\u2019 says George Herbert, the 8th Earl.Seven months ago, he and his wife Fiona were part of a select group at the Queen\u2019s committal service in St George\u2019s Chapel, Windsor, which followed the state funeral at the Abbey.It was there that the Royal Family and their closest friends said their final goodbyes to Her Majesty. Lord Carnarvon, who was the Queen\u2019s godson, was seated directly behind Charles.",
        "\u2018You can\u2019t always be part of everything,\u2019 he says today with the sort of diplomacy that helped his Herbert ancestors survive political back-stabbings right back to the War of the Roses.\u2018We were honoured to be part of the late Queen Elizabeth\u2019s funeral at St George\u2019s Chapel. It was the people who had connection with the family as friends or people who\u2019d worked on the [royal] estates. It was an extraordinary day, but very, very sad. The end of a great era.\u2019This will be the first time in history an Earl of Carnarvon has not been invited to the crowning of a British monarch.",
        "The King wants his coronation to be a modern, inclusive, diverse affair, reflecting today\u2019s Britain.\u2018Meritocratic not aristocratic,\u2019 we\u2019re told \u2013 or, depending upon where you stand, Charles is giving in to what financier Ben Goldsmith called the \u2018drips and dullards\u2019 of woke as he tries to fashion a right-on realm.So, out goes the coronation chicken, in comes the coronation quiche, with a ceremony shaved of excess and ermine as hereditary peers are told to tone down the ceremonial dress. That\u2019s if they\u2019re lucky enough to be going at all.The guest list has been cut from the 8,000 crammed into Westminster Abbey for the Queen\u2019s coronation to just 2,000, which means many of the families who have pledged allegiance to the Crown for generations will have to watch it on the telly.Those not invited include the Duke of Rutland, whose grandfather John, the 9th Duke, carried the orb in the procession into Westminster Abbey at George VI\u2019s coronation; the Duke of Somerset, whose title was created in 1547 and is the second oldest dukedom in the country; and the late Earl of Mountbatten\u2019s daughter Lady Pamela Hicks, who was bridesmaid to the Queen and attended both her and her father George VI\u2019s coronations.",
        "\u2018Everyone would love to be going to a glorious state occasion,\u2019 says Lord Carnarvon. His grandfather, the 6th Earl, was one of goodness knows how many hereditary peers and peeresses decked out in their crimson cloaks and coronets at the Queen\u2019s coronation.",
        "\u2018My grandfather did like putting on the ermine and all the gear from time to time. He was a theatrical type of person, but times have changed since my grandfather\u2019s \u2013 and my father\u2019s \u2013 time.\u2019The 7th Earl, a larger-than-life character, was the Queen\u2019s racing manager and one of her dearest friends whom she affectionately called Porchey.\u00a0The closeness between the two families is vividly apparent in the intimate family photo albums Lord Carnarvon, 65, shared with the Mail when he, like many of us, was \u2018flooded with emotion\u2019 following Her Majesty\u2019s death.The snaps include a grinning Charles as a boy larking around at Balmoral, where Lord Carnarvon, whom the Queen fondly called Geordie, and his family would join the Royal Family on holiday.Another was taken at Highclere Castle, familiar to millions as the setting for ITVs Downton Abbey, and shows the future king as a very young child happy in the 7th Earl\u2019s arms.The two families \u2013 one noble, one royal \u2013 shared many days of \u2018great gaiety, great enjoyment\u2019 while \u2018off parade\u2019, as Lord Carnarvon puts it.So much so, Lord Carnarvon\u2019s earliest childhood memory is being brought down as a small boy in short trousers to see the Queen.A self-effacing, deep-thinking man, Lord Carnarvon is sitting with me in the wood-panelled racing room at Highclere, an estate where the sport of kings has coursed through the blood for several generations, sharing his thoughts on the new Carolean era.",
        "He has no doubt that Charles III will be \u2018an absolutely excellent\u2019 King.\u2018I believe he will be modern, thinking about new ways forward. I only have very nice memories of him from when I was lucky enough to visit Sandringham and Balmoral with my father,\u2019 he says.\u2018The then Prince Charles would be part of the shooting party or going out on a picnic on the moors.\u2019With the mention of picnics, we segue into the merits of the rather cheerless Coronation quiche \u2013 broad beans, spinach, cheese.\u2018Lots and lots of cheese,\u2019 says Lady Carnarvon, who is a brilliant cook and, like many of us, a huge fan of Coronation chicken. Times, we agree, have changed.\u2018I wasn\u2019t expecting it [an invitation] necessarily,\u2019 says Lord Carnarvon. \u2018My father was a very close friend of the Queen and connected with horses and all the rest of it, but times change. Things move on.\u2019Aristocratic families such as his seem to be under attack left, right and centre since the late Queen\u2019s death.First, her elderly lady-in-waiting of more than 60 years and Prince William\u2019s godmother, Lady Susan Hussey, was accused of racism for asking British charity boss Ngozi Fulani where she was really from. Lady Susan has since apologised.",
        "\u2018I don\u2019t think she would have meant anything quite as much as was immediately suggested (by Ms Fulani on Twitter),\u2019 says Lord Carnarvon.",
        "Now it\u2019s slavery, or rather demands for those born into privilege with links to the slave trade to wipe out the sins of their ancestors by writing a cheque. Earlier this month, Charles signalled his support for research into the monarchy\u2019s connections to slavery.\u2018Well, the family [the Carnarvons] were not involved in owning property in the Caribbean so we haven\u2019t had a difficulty from that, have we?\u2019 asks Lord Carnarvon, turning to his wife. They exchange a look that suggests they\u2019ve discussed this privately with their chums more than a few times. Oh, to be a Van Dyke in the dining room.\u2018The thing is that over the centuries every generation has done something which you could criticise the previous generation for,\u2019 says Lady Carnarvon. \u2018Whether you look back to the Romans, the Greeks, the medieval times, every generation of humankind has been unkind, which is so sad, but it\u2019s then trying to learn from the experience, isn\u2019t it? Not to do it again.\u2019Long gone are the days of Downton Abbey when these old families rang a bell on a whim and the servants jumped. The Carnarvons are up at the crack of dawn and often work long past suppertime. You have to when you have 1,000 acres of parkland, and a further 4,500 of farmland, downland and woodland that are open to the public to stay on top of.",
        "Not that they mind. Lord and Lady C are dedicated to Highclere. They are, they say, simply the stewards of this spectacular place. When the 7th Earl died in 2001, they set their minds as to how the estate could survive.\u2018Whereas the estate used to support Geordie\u2019s family, we are working to support the estate,\u2019 says Lady Carnarvon. \u2018We knew we needed to find a way of making people love it. It\u2019s an emotional thing. It\u2019s from the heart.\u2019As if on cue, an American visitor singles out Lady C as we walk in the grounds of Highclere with the dogs. \u2018Pennsylvania sends its love,\u2019 she calls out. \u2018Send our love to Pennsylvania,\u2019 Lady C calls back. Phones are produced. Selfies and videos taken.",
        "Downton Abbey has made Highclere Castle famous throughout the world. Almost a fifth of the 1,200-a-day visitors are from the States. There are also Australians, French and Germans here, or at least those are the accents I hear in our 15-minute stroll.The estate represents the history and tradition that stands this country apart from so many others. Nationalities from all over the globe love being here.\u2018There\u2019s a visible history here of what our values and cultures have been for centuries,\u2019 says Lady C. \u2018You can see it and begin to grasp it, understand it and reflect upon it \u2013 which is quite hard to do nowadays.\u2018This Coronation is a big change but, having said that, it is a changed world. Geordie and I always have to be optimistic and not look negatively at decisions other people have made \u2013 just wish them the best.\u2019Lord C shoots his wife a fond look. \u2018We\u2019re all on the same side in terms of long-term stewardship and preservation. That\u2019s the strong bond between the older families and, therefore, we are loyal to and support the King,\u2019 he adds.Lord Carnarvon doesn\u2019t say the King might show some loyalty back, but let\u2019s just say I suspect he\u2019ll be digging into Coronation chicken rather than quiche on Saturday, wherever he and his lovely wife might be."
