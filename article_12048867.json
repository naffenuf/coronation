        "The New York Giants and defensive tackle Dexter Lawrence have agreed to terms on a four-year, $90 million contract extension, according to a person with knowledge of the deal.",
        "Lawrence, who had not participated in the team's voluntary offseason workouts while waiting for the deal, agreed Thursday to the massive contract, the person told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the Giants had not announced the extension.The deal averages $22.5 million per year, tying Lawrence with Washington's Daron Payne as the third-highest paid defensive tackle in the league based on annual salary, behind only the Los Angeles Rams' Aaron Donald ($31.7 million per year) and Tennessee's Jeffery Simmons ($23.5 million per year).The Giants picked up the fifth-year option on Lawrence's rookie contract last offseason, and the big D-lineman had a breakout season that included a career-high 7 1/2 sacks. He was selected a second-team All-Pro and made his first Pro Bowl.Lawrence was the 17th overall pick out of Clemson by the Giants in 2019. He has 16 1/2 career sacks, 58 quarterback hits, 21 tackles for loss and four forced fumbles in four seasons.___",
