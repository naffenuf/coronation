        "Kate Middleton, 41,\u00a0cut an elegant figure in a vibrant coat which featured\u00a0satin blue lining to resemble coronation bunting as she joined Prince William\u00a0at the Dog and Duck pub.The royal\u00a0proved her sustainable fashion prowess once again as she previously donned the coat\u00a0visiting the National Portrait Gallery in 2021.The London boutique is a favourite of the mother-of-three's as it's known for taking inspiration from the silhouettes of the 1950s and 1960s.She paired the striking coat with a white Suzannah dress, which she has\u00a0previously worn to Wimbledon, and a white Mulberry bag and matching Jimmy Choo heels.",
        "The coat, which is from their Autumn/Winter 2018 collection, features a mandarin collar and pretty button detailing.\u00a0The royal accessorised with\u00a0Maria Black earrings and her long brunette locks fell loose in a centre parting.\u00a0Her glam makeup enhanced her naturally flawless complexion and featured a subtle smokey eye.\u00a0William and Kate travelled on the Elizabeth Line from Acton Main Line station to Tottenham Court Road, the nearest stop to Soho, where they stopped off to pull pints and chat to hospitality staff at the Dog and Duck pub.\u00a0The prince and princess wanted to meet and thank Transport for London (TFL) workers who will be working throughout the coronation weekend.Asked about the royal family\u2019s preparations for Saturday, Kate said: \u2018Yes, it\u2019s going to be a very busy time. We\u2019re getting there. I still feel like we\u2019re trying to get ducks in a row.\u2019",
        "After being handed their Oyster cards by an aide and welcomed to Acton station by Andy Lord, TFL\u2019s commissioner, the couple met with Carinne Spinola, a train driver and Cameron Finch, a customer service assistant, and talked about their career aspirations.Once on board the train, they sat with a group of TFL workers, including David Pearce, a fleet manager, Liam Grindley, a service and infrastructure manager and Maria Serco, a maintenance engineer.",
        "Speaking about her conversation with Miss Spinola, Kate told the group: \u2018It\u2019s nice to meet a female train driver, obviously a profession women are keen on getting into. She said the job was advertised on Mumsnet.\u2019It was the couple\u2019s first trip on the Elizabeth Line, which the late Queen Elizabeth opened almost a year ago on May 17, 2022.Royal aides said the couple do \u2018occasionally\u2019 travel by tube in a private capacity.\u2018What\u2019s the feedback you\u2019ve been getting since it opened?\u2019 William asked.\u2018Everyone loves it,\u2019 Mr Grindley told him, explaining how it had made many journeys across London shorter and easier.\u2018And how green are we now,\u2019 asked William, laughing. \u2018You know I\u2019ve got to ask that question!\u2019",
        "William heard how the line\u2019s trains are electric, and how much of the earth that was dug up to build the line, was moved and re-used for a nature reserve. \u2018It\u2019s good, it clearly gets thought about now,\u2019 he said.",
        "Speaking to Miss Serco about the opening of the line last year, William said: \u2018I can\u2019t quite believe it has been nearly a year. It\u2019s quite nice to get the chance to see it all, after my grandmother opened it.\u2019Asking the group which of them would be working this weekend, Kate asked: \u2018Do you think there\u2019s going to be extra pressure on the service during the coronation weekend? How do you manage that?\u2019One of the group then asked how the royal family\u2019s preparations were going, and Kate replied: \u2018Yes, it\u2019s going to be a very busy time. We\u2019re getting there. I still feel like we\u2019re trying to get ducks in a row.\u2019After the short journey from Acton, via Paddington to Tottenham Court Road, the couple were presented with gifts by Mr Lord \u2013 a plaque tile of a TFL Roundel, or \u201cCrowndle\u201d as Mr Lord described it, inscribed with \u201cKing Charles III,\u201d and a TFL roundel lightbox for Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis.",
        "Dozens of stunned onlookers then rushed towards the escalator with their phones, to film the couple as they made their way up the escalator.Speaking after the couple had left the station, Mr Lord said: \u2018It was amazing to welcome them on their first visit on the Elizabeth Line. It\u2019s coming up to the anniversary of the Queen opening it, and they were very impressed with it.\u2019",
        "Miss Serco said of William: \u2018He was very interested in the technology, how we put the concrete in, the apprenticeships and training we offer. And I told him how much interest we\u2019ve had from other countries around the world. It was really nice to thank them for all the royal family\u2019s endorsement of the Elizabeth Line. We always knew we had their support. We feel the link to the royal family.\u2019Kensington Palace also invited tube and train enthusiast, Francis Bourgeois, whose real name is Luke, to ride on the train with William and Kate as an observer.He has more than a million followers on Instagram, and royal aides said it was hoped he might bring the experience to a \u2018younger audience\u2019.William and Kate then walked through the streets of London to the Dog &amp; Duck Pub to hear how it\u2019s preparing for the coronation weekend from members of staff and to meet representatives from other hospitality and recreation businesses in the area.The couple were served pints of cider - and Kate took a sip. William also pulled a pint of special coronation beer behind the bar brewed by Nicholson\u2019s - appropriately called Kingmaker Pale Ale.He was given the honour of pulling the first pint of it."
