        "After Baumgartner filed for divorce earlier this week, a\u00a0statement from Costner's representative read: 'It is with great sadness that circumstances beyond his control have transpired which have resulted in Mr. Costner having to participate in a dissolution of marriage action.'We ask that his, Christine's and their children's privacy be respected as they navigate this difficult time.'\u00a0Baumgartner, 49, is not said to be filing for spousal support, with Costner's response filed by Laura Wasser.'Spousal support to be payable to petitioner pursuant to the terms of the parties' Premarital Agreement,' Wasser said, indicating there is a pre-nuptial agreement between Costner and Baumgartner.The divorce news comes weeks after DailyMail.com reported new details about Costner's rift with Yellowstone creator Taylor Sheridan.Sources claimed Sheridan developed a 'God complex' which left Costner reportedly frustrated with the development of the hit Paramount Network series.The insider also alleged that Costner was left frustrated at how his concerns over the direction the series was taking were dismissed by Sheridan - saying that the actor, who also serves as an executive producer on Yellowstone - was told to 'stick to acting' when he raised questions about the future of the show.'Kevin will forever be proud of and grateful for Yellowstone and the cast is like family to him,' the source said of Costner, who recently nabbed a Golden Globe Award for best actor for his portrayal of John Dutton.'He just felt like Yellowstone is headed in a direction that was not in line with their initial vision and he was met with criticism, including that he should just stick to acting.'Last month, the New York Post reported that Costner's desire to cut down his workload on the fifth season to focus on other projects was also to blame for the tension between him and Sheridan.'It\u2019s the same as with any show runner and big star \u2014 there\u2019s respect, but there\u2019s friction,' a source described as 'well-placed' within the production told the outlet.There have also been reports that Costner's beloved character John Dutton will be killed off in the back half of Yellowstone's current fifth season.The first half of the season concluded on New Year's Day, with the second half originally slated to debut this summer, though that likely won't happen."
