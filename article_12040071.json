        "Several papers splash on the arrest of man for throwing suspected shotgun cartridges into the grounds of Buckingham Palace.Both the Daily Mirror and the Daily Express declare the palace was in lockdown, the Mirror calling it a \u201ccoronation security scare\u201d while the Express says police carried out a controlled explosion.The incident also makes the front of The Sun, which calls it \u201cPalace shotgun terror\u201d while the Daily Mail reports on the man being held by police.The Guardian, which is one of many front pages featuring a picture from the Met Gala in New York, focuses on letters sent to \u201canti-monarchists\u201d outlining new powers to deal with protests which it says have been \u201crushed into law\u201d ahead of the coronation.And the Daily Star has its own, individual take on the coronation countdown, saying the King \u201ccovers up his sausage fingers\u201d in the official pictures.",
        "Across Westminster, both the i and the Independent digital edition concentrate on former senior civil servant Sue Gray refusing to co-operate with the inquiry into her new role with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer.The Gray inquiry and the Met Gala also feature on the front of The Times, but the main story is a government plan to ban cold calling for financial products as part of a bid to tackle fraud.",
