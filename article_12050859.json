        "Adam Hills has asked why British citizens wouldn't pledge allegiance to King Charles III at his coronation on Saturday, as it's just 'a big old game'.\u00a0",
        "The Australian comedian, 52, said he will 'absolutely' be supporting the British King on Saturday.\u00a0'We are in a country where God Save The King is the national anthem that is sung before every sporting event,' he said on The Project, referring to Britain.'The King is on the stamps, the King is on the post boxes, we have a day off for the King's birthday.'At what point do you say okay to all that and then go \"Oh I'm not going to pledge allegiance to him\".'",
        "Adam then compared the British monarchy to Game Of Thrones, saying: 'It's a big old game, it's like Game Of Thrones, why wouldn't you want to be a part of it?'Millions of people around the globe will tune in to watch King Charles and Queen Consort Camilla be crowned at Westminster Abbey in London on Saturday.All the pomp and splendor will start at 7.30pm AEST with the King's procession to Westminster Abbey and the Coronation will begin at 8pm.",
        "Australians will be able to watch the once-in-a-generation event as it unfolds with the ABC, Sky News and Channel Seven among the outlets broadcasting the ceremony.Having ascended to the throne in September 2022, following the death of Queen Elizabeth II, King Charles III is set to officially be crowned as the reigning monarch of the United Kingdom.",
