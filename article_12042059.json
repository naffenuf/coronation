        "Footage posted on social media shows a violent altercation between the two women, with Scott ending up on top of the employee.Although the video posted to Twitter says 'They were both added to the no fly list', this is incorrect as one is Rhoden, who works for the airline.An Atlanta Police Department witness statement from Rhoden said Scott came to the gate and asked others what was going on with the flight that they were supposed to take.She then reportedly began to threaten one of the gate agents, who got on the phone to call 911.'Rhoden stated that the passenger made a statement to other passengers around that, she will beat a b**** up if she does not get on the plane,' the report said.'At that moment, Ms. Rhoden explained that she was going to deny her boarding to this flight due to her statement and actions at the gate area.'",
        "The gate agent then reportedly closed the gate, and Scott pulled up her sweat pants and proceeded to attack Rhoden by 'swinging her arms and hitting Ms. Rhoden on the left side of her face.''Ms. Rhoden then stated that Ms. Q. Scott began to pull her hair at the scene and pulling her into a barrier that was at the location causing them to fall to the ground,' the report continued.\u00a0'Ms. Rhoden stated that the female fell on top of her and it took for other passengers to get Ms. Q.

        "Body cam footage provided by Atlanta Police Department shows Rhoden saying 'she needs to be arrested.'In response\u00a0Scott shouts 'I'm pregnant, I'm pregnant' as she is handcuffed by officers.Scott then says: 'I didn't do nothing to nobody. You really just got me booked. It's cool. I'm going to remember your face in my head forever.'Scott was arrested by the\u00a0Atlanta Police Airport Division and transported\u00a0 to Clayton County Jail with a bond amount of $1,500 in fees and $350 in fees.The police report said Scott told officers she was pregnant as she was transported to the precinct.",
        "'During the event, Ms. Q. Scott advised that she was six months pregnant,' the report said.'Atlanta fire and EMS was called out to the precinct to check Ms. Scott out for any pains or discomforts.\u00a0Ms. Scott was not transported to the hospital.'DailyMail.com\u00a0has contacted Spirit Airlines for comment.\u00a0",
        "According to FOX 5, Spirit is one of\u00a0the few airlines that would bring on off-duty officers to monitor its gates in the past. That deployment has apparently been discontinued.It is not the first violent incident which has occurred at an airport gate of the airline.\u00a0Shocking video footage obtained in February exclusively for DailyMail.com\u00a0shows\u00a0Spirit Airlines agents trading blows with unruly passengers as they were boarding a flight in Philadelphia.\u00a0The vicious fight erupted at Philadelphia International Airport when a mom, 39, and her 17-year-old daughter were hit with extra fees because their carry-on luggage was too large.\u00a0Officers spoke to everyone involved but did not make any arrests over the dust-up."
