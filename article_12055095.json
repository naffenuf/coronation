        "After attending the coronation of the King in London, Brazil\u2019s President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva denounced the lack of concerted efforts to free WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has spent four years in Belmarsh Prison.",
        "\u201cIt is an embarrassment that a journalist who denounced trickery by one state against another is arrested, condemned to die in jail and we do nothing to free him. It\u2019s a crazy thing,\u201d Mr Lula told reporters.\u201cWe talk about freedom of expression; the guy is in prison because he denounced wrongdoing. And the press doesn\u2019t do anything in defence of this journalist. I can\u2019t understand it.\u201dMr Lula offered the remarks in response to a question about Assange, who is a native Australian. He said he had forgotten to discuss the matter with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, but that he would write to him upon returning to Brazil.",
        "Assange has been fighting extradition to the United States, and Mr Lula\u2019s comments come at a moment that he has shown little reluctance to voice his differences of opinion with Washington regarding geopolitical matters, particularly in his opposition to providing arms to Ukraine for its war against Russia, and accusing the US and Europe of encouraging the fighting.His stance and repeated statements have drawn sharp rebukes from the White House and Europe.For its part, Australia has been stepping up diplomatic pressure on the US government to call off its prosecution of Assange.On Friday, Australia\u2019s Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told the Australian Broadcasting Corp in an interview that \u201cenough is enough. There is nothing to be served by his ongoing incarceration\u201d.",
        "Last November, Mr Albanese told Parliament that his \u201cposition is clear and has been made clear to the US administration: That it is time that this matter be brought to a close\u201d.Assange has battled in British courts for years to avoid being sent to the US, where he faces 17 charges of espionage and one charge of computer misuse that stem from WikiLeaks\u2019 publication of a huge trove of classified documents in 2010.American prosecutors allege he helped US Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning steal classified diplomatic cables and military files that WikiLeaks later published, putting lives at risk.To his supporters, Assange is a secrecy-busting journalist who exposed US military wrongdoing in Iraq and Afghanistan.\u201cI think there must be a movement of world press in his defence. Not in regard to his person, but to defend the right to denounce,\u201d Mr Lula told reporters.\u201cThe guy didn\u2019t denounce anything vulgar. He denounced that a state was spying on others, and that became a crime against the journalist. The press, which defends freedom of the press, does nothing to free this citizen. It\u2019s sad, but it\u2019s true.\u201dLast year, Assange\u2019s father John Shipton sought to convince Mexico\u2019s President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to address the issue of his son\u2019s prosecution with the US\u2019 top diplomat, and to get Australia\u2019s Mr Albanese to raise the issue with US President Joe Biden at Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s funeral."
