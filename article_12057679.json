        "A man has died after being found critically injured inside a car following a shooting in suburban Melbourne, with three other men on the run.",
        "The unidentified man was discovered in a BMW parked outside a home on Vaucluse Boulevard in Taylors Hill at 11.30pm on Sunday.Paramedics started to treat him but he couldn't be saved.Police say the BMW had been following a white Mitsubishi sedan through the suburb, when the Mitsubishi crashed into bollards, blocking Grange Terrace and Johnston Way.It is believed a man got out of the Mitsubishi and confronted the male driver and male passenger in the BMW, before firing a shot into the car, killing the passenger.He is yet to be identified.The male driver and passenger of the Mitsubishi left the scene on foot, asking some local residents for directions on how to get out of the estate.The driver of the BMW drove a few streets away before calling triple zero and reporting the shooting.No one else was physically injured during the incident.\"We believe that there is connection between these two cars and these people. This is not a random attack,\" Detective Acting Inspector Nigel L'Estrange told reporters.Authorities arrived and an SES tent was set up around the BMW, which had a hole through the windscreen and shattered glass.Officers were also examining the crash involving a Mitsubishi about 500 metres away.Det Insp L'Estrange confirmed the BMW was a stolen vehicle while police are still making inquiries on the Mitsubishi.",
        "The homicide squad is leading the investigation and detectives are keen to speak to any witnesses or anyone who may have footage of the incident.\"We know that there's three other males involved in this incident,\" Det Insp L'Estrange said.\"I would be appealing to them to come forward. Get on the front foot. We will identify you very soon.\""
