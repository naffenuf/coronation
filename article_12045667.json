The money that that pays me does support my lifestyle.\u00a0",
        "'[My businesses]\u00a0 continued to grow and we added new branches to the company.'Wealth is a ratio between our income and our expenses. It's not a flat number.'After dropping out of school at 17, the TikToker claims he doesn't regret missing out on the 'crazy' experience of university.He founded\u00a0Ecom Season, which is a platform which offers a number of different courses, which cost up to\u00a0$575 and cover topics like\u00a030 Day Ecom Academy and Ecom Remastered 2.0.In one video, he said: 'It's the same exact experience - all the stupidity of college but you take it up like 20 levels further because everyone has money'.",
        "Hayden has claimed\u00a0he was making a 'substantial' income of \u00a3200k and by age 20 this had had quadrupled to \u00a3800k.\u00a0He now claims he has raised over \u00a316 million through his e-commerce focused businesses.\u00a0In another video, he told his followers that the key to success is trying 'to have a singular focus'.",
        "He told fans to avoid splitting their attention between multiple ventures and focus on 'something scalable that you want to do long-term.'The influencer now regularly shares photographs from his luxurious holidays across the US, including trips to Hawaii and Vail.Meanwhile he also posts snaps alongside expensive cars and private jets.\u00a0\u00a0He's not the first from the generation of Gen-Z to reveal the incredible wealth they've built up during their early adult life.\u00a0Despite her young age, Mon Kumar, from Melbourne, is already financially savvy and has an impressive net worth of $219,000 - which is calculated by her total number of assets minus any liabilities.Over the past five years, Mon has been budgeting and working tirelessly but started learning how to invest when she was 20.'I realised that investing can allow you to be financially independent and give you the freedom to do whatever you want in life,' Mon told FEMAIL.",
        "'I started to invest seriously over the past year or so as I stumbled across the Financially Independent Retire Early (FIRE) community.'",
        "Mon said her strategy is to invest in a combination of high-growth Exchange Traded Funds (ETF's) and high yield ETF's to achieve high profit with minimal risk.While Mon studied a Bachelors degree in business at university, she learnt everything she knows about investing by listening to podcasts, reading books and watching YouTube videos.'I don't think you need a finance degree to understand how to invest,' she said.Since she was 20, Mon has also been working more than 40 hours a week on top of her university commitments, which she found challenging but beneficial.'Working long hours through university was extremely hard and if it weren't for my eagerness to save for a house deposit and achieving FIRE, I don't think that I would be able to do it,' she said.'Working more than 40 hours a week has allowed me to achieve my financial goals much faster that I would have expected and I have absolutely no regrets.'But her hard work and dedication paid off as she not only has a high net worth but in May 2020 Mon and her partner put down a $100,000 deposit for a Melbourne apartment worth $532,000.Mon's net worth includes her assets of superannuation, cash savings, home equity, investments and car minus her HECS debt and mortgage.",
        "Mon said investing will help allow her become financially independent and reach her goal of owning one million dollars by the age of 35."
