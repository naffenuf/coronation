James Harden followed his 2-of-14 effort in a Game 2 loss with 3-for-13 shooting for 16 points.The Sixers pulled within five on De\u00b4Anthony Melton\u00b4s 3-pointer to get the crowd back into the game for all of 20 seconds before Malcolm Brogdon countered with a 3 to give Boston a 100-92 lead. Al Horford crushed the Sixers again - as he has most of his career - when he buried a 3 for a seven-point lead.Embiid, forced to try and win it alone without any serious offensive helped, missed a pull-up 18-footer and Tatum drained a jumper that all but put the game away.
