        "The countdown to the coronation of the King has begun but the controversial \u201cHomage of the People\u201d element of the service has been toned down.",
        "Charles reportedly approved the change which came after a string of commentators criticised the new addition as divisive.Broadcaster Jonathan Dimbleby, a friend of Charles who wrote the King\u2019s authorised biography, said the monarch would find the Homage of the People \u201cabhorrent\u201d.",
        "The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, will now \u201cinvite\u201d a show of support from the congregation rather than a \u201ccall\u201d to those in the Abbey and elsewhere to swear allegiance to the King.Build up to the big day has already begun with workers sweeping sand onto roads, police officers arriving and a rain shelter is being set up outside the Abbey entrance.Metropolitan police and military police officers patrolled the route from Victoria to Westminster from the early hours on Saturday.Royal fans with Union flags and crowns could be seen on trains and in Tube stations from just after 4.30am.The King will be crowned at Westminster Abbey by the Archbishop of Canterbury during a coronation ceremony dating back centuries.",
        "Cries of God Save the King will ring out around the abbey after St Edward\u2019s Crown is placed on Charles\u2019 head by Mr Welby.The senior cleric said in a statement issued on the eve of the coronation that the ceremony served as \u201ca powerful reflection and celebration of who we are today, in all our wonderful diversity\u201d.",
        "He said people will be struck by the \u201cmajesty and sacred wonder\u201d of the service, but also hoped they would find \u201cancient wisdom and new hope\u201d.The event will bring together around 100 heads of state, kings and queens from across the globe, celebrities, everyday heroes and family and friends of the couple, with Charles\u2019 estranged son the Duke of Sussex expected to attend.Invited guests include David and Victoria Beckham, musician Lionel Richie, French President Emmanuel Macron, King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima of the Netherlands, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and US First Lady Jill Biden but her husband President Joe Biden will not be attending.",
        "The day will be a display of pomp and pageantry, with the nation\u2019s Armed Forces promising a \u201cspectacular\u201d event when the King and Queen process through the streets of the capital.The event is the military\u2019s largest ceremonial operation since Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s 1953 coronation, with 9,000 servicemen and women deployed and 7,000 of these performing ceremonial and supporting roles.Mr Welby followed the longstanding tradition of commissioning new coronation liturgy \u2013 the prayers and actions of the coronation service \u2013 which has the theme Called To Serve.He chaired an advisory group of theology, constitutional history and inter-faith relationships experts to draft the liturgy, produced in close consultation with the King and the Government.",
        "The Homage of the People replaced the homage of peers, and Lambeth Palace described it as an invitation to the estimated global television audience of tens of millions to make a \u201ca great cry around the nation and around the world in support for the King\u201d.",
        "Mr Welby was to say: \u201cI call upon all persons of goodwill in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and of the other realms and the territories to make their homage, in heart and voice, to their undoubted King, defender of all.\u201dAll those interested would be invited to say: \u201cI swear that I will pay true allegiance to your majesty, and to your heirs and successors according to law. So help me God.\u201dBut now he will say: \u201cI now invite those who wish to offer their support to do so, with a moment of private reflection, by joining in saying God save King Charles at the end or, for those with the words before them, to recite them in full.\u201dA Lambeth Palace spokesperson said: \u201cThe Homage of the People was always an invitation rather than expectation.\u201cTo provide further clarity as the order of service was finalised, it has been mutually agreed by Lambeth Palace and Buckingham Palace that the introductory words will be changed.",
        "\u201cThis reflects the collaborative approach that has been taken throughout the coronation planning. We are looking forward to the service with much joy and expectation.\u201d"
