        "The attendance of China\u2019s vice-president at the King\u2019s coronation is a sign that the global power does not give \u201ctwo hoots\u201d about the UK, the last British governor of Hong Kong has suggested.",
        "Han Zheng, who has been blamed for overseeing a crackdown on freedom in Hong Kong, was recently appointed as President Xi Jinping\u2019s deputy and is set to represent China at the royal event.Foreign Secretary James Cleverly, who will meet the Chinese politician, indicated that he will raise issues including Hong Kong and human rights abuses in Xinjiang province.But Lord Patten was critical of elements of the Government\u2019s current approach to China, as he said the decision to send Mr Han is a reflection of how China sees Britain. However hard we try to lean over backwards, horizontally sometimes, to accommodate their own political narrative, I don\u2019t think they really give two hoots about us  Lord Patten  \u201cIt doesn\u2019t say anything bad about the British Government in particular, and of course it\u2019s got nothing to do with the King and I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t cast clouds over what I imagine will be a very happy occasion,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s World At One programme.\u201cBut it does give an indication of what the Chinese Communist Party actually thinks about us because, while he may or may not be a significant figure in Xi Jinping\u2019s court, he was actually the guy responsible for policy on Hong Kong.\u201cYou can\u2019t ignore the fact that he\u2019s there, and it\u2019s a stick in the eye for 140,000 or more Hongkongers who are in exile here with the help of the BNO passport scheme.",
        "\u201cAnd also I think it\u2019s an indication of the fact that, however much you grovel to China, however much you try to give them face, they don\u2019t give a toss about giving us face because they could have sent lots of other people.\u201cThere are, after all, 1.4 billion of them and they chose to send the guy who\u2019s responsible for breaking their word about Hong Kong.\u201dHe added: \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t deliberate, then it shows how casually they actually treat us anyway.\u201cSo, however hard we try to lean over backwards, horizontally sometimes, to accommodate their own political narrative, I don\u2019t think they really give two hoots about us.\u201dThe Chinese vice-president will be among the many world leaders, dignitaries and senior officials from around the world who will travel to London for the coronation on Saturday.But some senior Tories, including former leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith, have strongly criticised the invitation for Mr Han.",
        "Mr Han led Hong Kong affairs for Beijing between 2018 and March this year, during which time it imposed the national security law after mass protests in the city, stifling opposition and criminalising dissent.The move strained relations with the UK and led to the creation of a visa scheme allowing Hongkongers to come to Britain.",
        "The UK says China remains in breach of the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, under which it has a duty to uphold Hong Kong\u2019s high degree of autonomy and rights and freedoms.Hong Kong was handed over from the UK to China in 1997 with a promise by Beijing to keep Western-style liberties under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d framework.Lord Patten said the UK should \u201cactually stand up for ourselves and stand up to them\u201d when it comes to China, as he criticised the approach of \u201crobust pragmatism\u201d favoured by Rishi Sunak and Mr Cleverly.The Prime Minister\u2019s policy on China has been seen as a notable shift from the harder line taken by Liz Truss, with the \u201crefreshed\u201d integrated review referring to China \u201cepoch-defining and systemic challenge\u201d.\u201cIt\u2019s preferable to the Golden Age, which was Mr (David) Cameron and Mr (George) Osborne\u2019s view at the same time as the Chinese were beginning their crackdown in Xinjiang and beginning to think about the crackdown in Hong Kong,\u201d the peer said.\u201cBut what I notice about these speeches, about robust pragmatism, is that they\u2019ve got lots and lots of strong nouns and strong adjectives, but you actually search through them for a strong verb\u2026 they don\u2019t tend to include many strong verbs.\u201d",
        "A recent speech by Mr Cleverly on China, Lord Patten added, also \u201cleant over backwards to give as rosy a picture of what was happening in China as possible\u201d."
