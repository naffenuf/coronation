        "GUIDONIA MONTECELIO, Italy (AP) - Julien Guerrier will take a one-shot lead into the final round of the Italian Open.",
        "Guerrier started the day two shots off the lead but carded eight birdies and three bogeys in a 5-under 66, moving atop the leaderboard.His one-stroke advantage was over French compatriot Romain Langasque, who set a new course record at the Marco Simone club outside Rome, and Poland\u00b4s Adrian Meronk.\"I started with a bogey on two and after that I stayed patient,\" Guerrier said. \"I know with this kind of course, my coach said, `You are going to play some good shots, so try to manage and don\u00b4t give too many shots away to the course,\u00b4 and I did that.\"Langasque hit seven birdies and an eagle in his record-breaking 9-under 62.\"I did not expect nine under, I didn\u00b4t expect to shoot a very low score on this course because it\u00b4s quite a tough course,\" Langasque said. \"I didn\u00b4t expect that score and I am very happy about it.\"Matthieu Pavon, who led after both of the previous rounds, was four shots behind Guerrier along with Marcel Siem, Tapio Pulkkanen and Daniel van Tonder.Marco Simone will host the Ryder Cup in September.___More AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"
