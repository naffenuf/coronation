        "February 2022 was not only the month that Cherry was diagnosed with cancer, but it was also quickly followed by the death of Ed's close friend Jamal Edwards.Jamal, a music producer and the son of Loose Women star Brenda Edwards, died at 31 from a cardiac arrest brought on by taking cocaine and drinking alcohol.The pair became close after Jamal's YouTube channel SBTV helped to propel Ed into the spotlight, and the entrepreneur gave the aspiring musician a place to sleep when he was 18 and had no place to live in London.In that February, Ed was fighting a court case \u2014 which he later won \u2014 over his hit Shape Of You, which he was accused of plagiarising.The star said: 'That was a horrible, horrible, horrible month. Life hasn't moved on for me yet and I don't think it will.'Cherry was diagnosed with a tumor six months into her pregnancy with their second child, Jupiter, who just turned one.Doctors told the couple that the tumour required surgery, but that it wouldn't be an option until after Cherry had given birth.\u00a0In the new series, Cherry reveals it was fearing she 'may die' that encouraged her to be part of Ed's documentary, with the incentive to show he wasn't just 'music machine' leading her decision.\u00a0",
        "Ed's close friend Jamal passed away the day after Cherry was told her tumor was not as severe as doctors had first feared, and that she would not need to have her baby early to allow doctors to operate.\u00a0In the documentary, Cherry expresses concern over Ed's mental health and fears that he is working too hard to process his heartache.She says: 'He's worked every day this year, either writing, performing or doing promo. We've barely had a conversation this year about his mental health. I can see it and there's massive alarm bells for me.'But Ed says writing his sixth studio album Subtract, helped him deal with the loss of his friend. He says: 'The moment you find the worst thing has happened to someone you truly love, you feel like you're drowning and can't get out from under it.'Just from that situation, all these songs came out. It's scary putting your deepest, darkest thoughts out into the world, but I think I'm super ready to just put Subtract out and move on from it emotionally.'Ed Sheeran: The Sum Of It All is set to premiere on Disney+ on May 3.\u00a0"
