In fact, while using your mobile when operating a vehicle is subject to strict legislation, there an exemption in the Highway Code for drivers who are using a mobile phone to make an immediate contactless payment at a payment terminal where the vehicle is stationary. There is no requirement to turn off the car's engine.In the second article we suggested that placing a stamp upside-down on an envelope may be considered to fall under the auspices of the Treason Felony Act 1848. The Act does not refer to stamps and, according to Royal Mail, placing a stamp upside-down would have no legal ramifications.\u00a0To report an inaccuracy, please email corrections@mailonline.co.uk.
