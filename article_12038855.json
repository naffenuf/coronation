        "Chief executive Alan Burrows has warned that Aberdeen \u201cwill be a very difficult club to deal with\u201d if any interested parties attempt to sign their best players.",
        "Strikers Luis \u201cDuk\u201d Lopes and Bojan Miovski have notched 18 goals apiece in their maiden seasons at Pittodrie and have been the subject of interest from elsewhere.\u201cBoth Duk and Miovski are in the first year of long-term contracts,\u201d said Burrows. \u201cThe club is under no pressure to sell them and the club don\u2019t want to sell them.\u201cIf anybody wants to take our best assets away from us, particularly ones who have long contracts, we\u2019re going to be a very difficult club to deal with.\u201cWe have to marry up a model that says we develop young players through the academy and players we bring in to develop and sell, but at the same time you\u2019ve got to balance that by building a squad rather than consistently chipping away at it, so in order to do that you\u2019ve got to retain the best value for these players.\u201cPeople have got to know that Aberdeen Football Club will do that. The board have done that in the past, they\u2019ve knocked back big offers for players and I sense from the ownership group and the board that they\u2019re more than prepared to do that again.",
        "\u201cWe want to build a strong team and retain the best players whilst also understanding that there is a model that requires us to continually look to trade on players to continue the health of the football club and invest in the team.",
        "\u201cIt won\u2019t be easy for anybody who wants to take any of our best players, that\u2019s for sure.\u201dBurrows was speaking at a press conference on Tuesday, a day after interim boss Barry Robson \u2013 who was initially in situ only until the end of this season \u2013 was handed a contract for the next two years.The recently-recruited CEO explained why former under-18s coach Robson, who has won eight of his 10 games in charge, emerged as the favoured choice following an \u201cextensive\u201d recruitment process that explored \u201ca number of key candidates\u201d.\u201cI had never met Barry before I came to the club but I\u2019d heard a lot about him. I was really taken aback by how highly regarded he was by the senior people at Pittodrie and then after my first meeting with him at Cormack Park,\u201d said Burrows, who joined Aberdeen at the end of February, a month after Robson took the reins from the sacked Jim Goodwin.\u201cThat hour-and-a-half I could really sense what type of character he is and I really liked him from the get-go. I thought \u2018this guy\u2019s really got the materials to be doing it\u2019.\u201cIn terms of the stuff he\u2019s been doing away from the pitch, Barry\u2019s been developing a bit of a DNA about what it means to be an Aberdeen player, right through from the youngest academy players, to the development age groups, to the first team, and really trying to home in on what it means to play for this club and be successful.",
        "\u201cAnd now that he\u2019s the manager, we\u2019re really excited about him being able to drive that forward from the top down.\u201cIt\u2019s almost that utopia of what football clubs want, that connectivity between the three different areas of player development and we think Barry now is the flagship, most senior person within the football department and he can really drive that forward and connect up those departments.\u201cFirst and foremost it\u2019s about winning matches \u2013 and he\u2019s doing that. Developing players and giving them confidence and a structure, and he\u2019s done that.\u201cAnd the third thing is to connect up all the various departments and the various age groups to create a real synergy between the very youngest player and the most senior player.\u201cThose were the three key reasons about (appointing) Barry and also we\u2019ve got a big job to do this summer and that was part of the reason for expediting the process slightly from what we\u2019d said about six weeks ago.\u201d"
