        "Bolton warmed up for the Sky Bet League One play-offs with a hard-fought 3-2 victory over Bristol Rovers at the Memorial Stadium.",
        "On-loan Manchester United striker Shola Shoretire put Bolton in front in the 24th minute, tapping in a goalbound effort from Gethin Jones \u2013 who soon limped off.Things went from bad to worse four minutes later for Bolton as Luca Hoole nodded in the equaliser after Sam Finley\u2019s cross cannoned off the woodwork and then Josh Coburn\u2019s header crashed off the crossbar.Wanderers boss Ian Evatt\u2019s injury worries deepened after the break as Shoretire hobbled off but replacement Daniel Nlundulu eased those concerns as the Southampton loanee restored the visitors\u2019 lead with 20 minutes remaining with a 20-yard strike.Aaron Morley doubled Bolton\u2019s advantage in the 78th minute with a long-range effort before Rovers substitute John Marquis slotted home from close range with five minutes remaining.It set up a tense finale and the hosts came close to earning a point when Scott Sinclair\u2019s stoppage-time strike hit the bar."
