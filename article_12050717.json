You need passion and desire to win your battles in the game.",
        "\u2018It is very strong with him and he is very ambitious. Don't go over the top: stay focused on your game and what the game needs. If he does that, he is a great player. I think his improvement is quite obvious and clear.\u2019United are aiming to bounce back from the Brighton defeat when they face West Ham at the London Stadium on Sunday night.Ten Hag is looking forward to taking on David Moyes for the third time this season having beaten the former United boss twice at Old Trafford in the Premier League and FA Cup.",
        "\u2018It is an experience,\u2019 added Ten Hag. \u2018He is a fantastic manager, so long in the Premier League already. I am looking forward to it. We've faced them twice already this season, and it\u2019s going to be another great game. Every game is a battle and a challenge so we have to be ready.\u2019"
