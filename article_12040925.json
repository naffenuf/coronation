        "GENEVA, May 3 (Reuters) - The European Union on Tuesday requested consultations with the United States at the World Trade Organization (WTO), accusing it of failing to comply with previous decisions in a dispute concerning Spanish olives.",
        "\"The measures taken by the United States adversely affect exports to the United States of ripe olives from Spain, and also nullify or impact the benefits accruing to the EU and its member states directly or indirectly...,\" the EU said in a statement distributed by the WTO.A spokesperson for the Office of the United States Trade Representative said in a statement to Reuters that the United States was in full compliance with its WTO obligations.In November 2021, the WTO gave a mixed ruling in a case involving U.S. tariffs on Spanish olives, finding the United States had correctly determined they were being dumped on the U.S. market but not that they benefited from subsidies.
