        "OLD BRIDGE, N.J. (AP) - Authorities in a central New Jersey town say they are no longer noodling over the mystery of how hundreds of pounds of pasta were dumped near a stream.",
        "Old Bridge Mayor Owen Henry said Friday that the pasta, including spaghetti and macaroni, was cleaned up last week by public works crews, shortly after officials learned about the oodles of noodles that quickly drew national attention when photos of the pasta were posted on social media.The estimated 500 pounds (225 kilograms) of pasta were apparently raw when it was dumped, but subsequent heavy rains softened the food and made the mounds look like they had been cooked, officials have said. It\u00b4s unclear who dumped the pasta there or why, but it\u00b4s not believed the pasta had been at the site for long before it was discovered.Henry said the pasta did not cause any environmental damage or health issues and he considers the matter closed.\"It certainly shouldn\u00b4t have ended up in the woods - putting in or near the stream bed was not the best idea - but I certainly hope our police are not putting more time into this\" he said. \"Assuming the pasta was still usable, I wish it had ended up in our food bank, which could have really used it.\""
