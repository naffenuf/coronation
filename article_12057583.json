        "Fulham boss Marco Silva admits Aleksandar Mitrovic\u2019s eight-game suspension has affected not just his striker but the whole west London club.",
        "The Serbian will miss Monday\u2019s meeting with Leicester as he serves the final game of his lengthy ban, incurred after he grabbed referee Chris Kavanagh during the Cottagers\u2019 FA Cup defeat at Manchester United in March.Silva said his staff were doing everything they could to ensure Mitrovic was ready to face Southampton on Saturday, but revealed it has not been a straightforward process.",
        "\u201cOf course it\u2019s been a tough period for him, like you expect,\u201d said Silva. \u201cHe\u2019s been working hard, it has to be like that with no chance (to play) and the mood in some days is a little bit better than the others.\u201cHe knew one month ago that he is going to be out eight games, it\u2019s really tough for any player.\u201cIf you have an injury, muscular injury or something that we know, ok, it\u2019s part of life.\u201cBut in all this situation, the way it has come for us, the way everything happened as well, the treatment behind all that scenario, it was really tough, not just for Mitro, I have to say for our football club. We felt something that is not good.\u201dThe 28-year-old had scored 11 times in 21 appearances for Silva\u2019s side before his suspension.He initially received a standard three-match ban, which was later increased by three games for violent conduct towards a match official, with another two added for using language which was \u201cimproper, abusive, insulting and threatening\u201d.",
        "A later appeal by the Football Association to increase the suspensions for Mitrovic and Silva, who was banned for two matches for his own involvement in that clash, was later dismissed by an independent appeal board.Fulham hope Monday\u2019s meeting with relegation-battling Leicester will help them bounce back from consecutive losses to Manchester City and Liverpool before Mitrovic\u2019s return against Saints gives them another boost.Whether he will be ready start that match is still to be determined.",
        "Silva said: \u201cWe are here to support Mitro. It is up to him to keep working hard to where he can be as best as he can be from a physical point of view. It will be good to have him again for the next match.\u201cHe is working hard and we are doing everything we can to keep him in a very good shape. He is doing his maximum as well to be, and of course when he is going to be available it\u2019s up to me to decide if he\u2019s ready to start the game or not.\u201cBut this is another situation for the next match. He\u2019s working hard and we are trying to keep it as best as it can be.\u201d"
