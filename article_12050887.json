        "Erik ten Hag is confident Manchester United will bounce back from their latest setback and go on to seal \u201cvital\u201d Champions League qualification over the coming weeks.",
        "This has largely been a season of improvement and promise under the Dutchman, but the Red Devils\u2019 away form against the better sides has been wretched.United have not won a Premier League game at any of the top nine teams, with Thursday\u2019s last-gasp defeat at Brighton meaning they have collected just one point from a possible 27 on the road against those sides.Alexis Mac Allister\u2019s stoppage-time penalty sealed Brighton a 1-0 win that leaves Ten Hag\u2019s men just four points above fifth-placed Liverpool, albeit with a game in hand.",
        "Thursday\u2019s loss was a blow but United have proven adept at recovering from them this season, with the manager confident of Champions League qualification.\u201cWe have every time in this season when we had a defeat, we bounce back,\u201d Ten Hag said ahead of Sunday\u2019s trip to West Ham.\u00a0\u201cSo, I count on my players, I count on my team. We have to do it again.\u201cThere is no time to stay in this (disappointment), so in one hour we go onto the game against West Ham United. All focus on that.\u201cWe prepare for them, we make a good plan, the players have to take responsibility and they will do. I count on them.\u201cThey have to do it and they can do it because we have the evidence in the season. Every time when we had disappointments, they bounce back.\u201d",
        "Pushed on the top four race, the United boss said: \u201cWe had a quite good run from the last five \u2013 four wins and a draw (before Brighton).\u201cWe have everything in our hands, so we have to focus on our performance. I trust my players, so I am quite convinced about that.\u201dTen Hag has never shied away from the importance of qualifying for the Champions League and recently stressed there can be \u201cno misunderstanding\u201d about their need to return to Europe\u2019s top table.Reiterating that stance after the loss at Brighton, he said: \u201cManchester United, of course, we need to be there in the Champions League.\u201cWe want to be there because we want to challenge with the best teams in the world, so we do everything that\u2019s in our power to get that done.\u201cI think it is always vital that we have to be in the Champions League.\u201cIt\u2019s a battle because in the Premier League many clubs are competing for it and they have the power to fight for that as well. We want to be there. We do everything to get there.\u201d",
        "Ten Hag says there are no fresh concerns as their Champions League qualification quest continues at the London Stadium, where they could be boosted by Alejandro Garnacho\u2019s return.",
        "The talented 18-year-old winger has been out for eight weeks with an ankle injury and Ten Hag said that \u201cmaybe he can be involved but we have to see\u201d.One player that is perhaps fortunate to be available on Sunday is Antony, who received only a booking for a frustrated challenge on Mac Allister.Asked about channelling the Brazil international\u2019s passion, Ten Hag said: \u201cYeah, but I think his passion is his strength.",
        "\u201cOf course, until a certain level you have to control it. But you need passion and desire to win your games and to win battles in the game.\u201cIt\u2019s true, it\u2019s very strong with him. He is very ambitious.\u201cAs I say, don\u2019t go over the top, stay focused on your game and what the game needs. If he is doing that, he is a great player.\u201cI think his performance, his improvement is quite obvious and clear.\u201d"
