The company has 154 locations worldwide, including 80 company-owned or -operated restaurants and 74 franchised restaurants.The company, now based in Winter Park, Florida, suffered as most restaurants did during the pandemic, closing 23 restaurants in early 2020, furloughing workers and announcing that executives were taking less pay.Shares of Ruth\u00b4s Hospitality Group Inc., which owns the restaurants, recovered within a year of the outbreak. Shares were halted before the market opened and jumped more than 30% at the opening bell.Darden, also based in Florida, is acquiring all outstanding shares of Ruth\u00b4s for $21.50 per share, a 34% premium.\"Ruth\u00b4s Chris is a strong and distinctive brand in the fine dining segment with an impressive history of delivering elevated dining experiences to their loyal guests,\" said Darden CEO Rick Cardenas said in a prepared statement Wednesday.",
