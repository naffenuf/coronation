        "Guardiola was furious when City\u2019s stars offered Ilkay Gundogan the chance of completing a hat-trick from the spot in the 84th minute, only for the German star to miss.Seconds later Leeds pulled a goal back to set up a nervy finish and Guardiola said: \u2018If it\u2019s 2-0, who is the taker? The taker is Erling or Riyad.\u2019Guardiola was furious at the time and was seen shouting: \u2018You should have taken it\u2019 to 42-goal top scorer Haaland.\u00a0And the City boss added: \u2018At 2-0 especially in England, the game never is over. I wanted the taker to take it, they have more routine and specialist.",
        "\u2018Saying that, Gundo could have scored, other ones could have missed. But it\u2019s not about that. I admire that Gundo wanted to take the responsibility to take the penalty. That is the best value as a player. But normally the taker is the taker, Erling has to take it, he\u2019s the specialist.\u2019And Gundogan admitted that Guardiola let the players know he was unhappy in the dressing room.\u2018First he showed to Erling that he was quite mad about that and then also he had a go at me,\u2019\u00a0Gundogan said. \u2018The moment Erling grabbed the ball, I was sure he was going to take it but he looked out for me. I checked with him a few times to make sure he was sure.\u2019"
