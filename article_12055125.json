        "The volunteers braced the rainy and cold spring weather in rain ponchos as they walked down the procession route with litter pickers.They concentrated their cleaning efforts on The Mall, where King Charles passed through with Queen Camilla in the Diamond Jubilee coach during their journey from Westminster Abbey to Buckingham Palace.\u00a0Equipped with grabbers and massive white bin bags, the volunteers made sure to collect all the rubbish left behind by the millions of royal fans who filled the Mall on Saturday.The litter left by royal supporters ranged from empty cups and plastic bottles to forgotten sun hats that were discarded during the rain showers.",
        "Several bin lorries were sent out to collect the full bin bags from the volunteers and transport them quickly way from The Mall.Just hours earlier the golden Diamond Jubilee coach had travelled down the road now occupied by various cleaning vehicles.\u00a0\u00a0Die-hard royal fans decked out in red white and blue, who had secured their positions after camping out for days, were told before the ceremony to take down their tents to fit the maximum number of people into viewing areas.\u00a0But hundreds of royal fans were left disappointed as the Met Police said there was no space for new arrivals with all entrance points to Athena Mall closed off after the maximum number of people was reached as millions lined the street.\u00a0",
        "This left the roads running parallel to The Mall choked full of disappointed and angry royal fans unable to get close enough to witness the historic occasion, some of which left their rubbish behind for volunteers to pick up.\u00a0"
