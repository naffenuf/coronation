I'm not gonna lie, without my family, I don't know what my life would be,' he captioned the post.But fans quickly called him out after they noticed one\u00a0very important person was missing from his post - the daughter he share with ex-wife Kim Basinger, Ireland Baldwin, 27.Shortly there after, Baldwin made a post dedicated to his firstborn - and awkwardly admitted he 'forgot' to include her in the original post.",
        "'We forgot Billy Preston! This one, the first one, is about to make me a grandfather. Oy,' he captioned the post.The original post contained seven individual photos of the children he shares with Hilaria - daughters Carmen, nine, Lucia, two, Ilaria, nearly eight months, and sons Leonardo, six, Rafael, seven, Romeo, four, Eduardo, two.\u00a0But fans were quick to notice Ireland's absence, and took to the Instagram comments to hold Alec to account.'Don't you have 8 children?' one commenter wrote.'What about Ireland?' another wrote.'Guess Ireland doesn't count??' one fan posted.'Lol forget Ireland, I guess,' another commented.",

You never include her. Someone probably called it to your attention or would you have even mentioned her and your new Grandchild. Wow,' another wrote.'How do you forget one of your kids tho really. This is the exact reason I cut my dad off. He forgot me and my 3 kids. Cut gik,' another wrote.'He has so many babies now he \"forgot\" he had an adult daughter. So cringe,' another posted.Several fans also wondered why Baldwin had referred to Ireland as 'Billy Preston' in the new post.\u00a0",

        "The two have repaired their relationship since then.",
        "In 2019, Ireland made light of the voicemail at his Comedy Central Roast.'I'm here to roast this big old ham I call my father,' she smirked.'Speaking of pigs, some of you may remember me as that \"thoughtless little pig\" you read about. That was a decade ago, and my dad and I are in a much better place now. He would never say something like that,' she went on. 'Because I'm 6-foot-2 and I would kick his a**.'Ireland is now pregnant with her first child. She is expecting a daughter with her boyfriend RAC, and plans on naming her Holland.\u00a0The post comes after all charges against Baldwin were dropped in the accidental shooting death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, 42, on the New Mexico set of Rust.\u00a0"
