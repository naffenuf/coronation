        "Through her lifestyle website Goop, Gwyneth, 50, has certainly unveiled it all\u00a0She has shared lists of her favorite sex toys and go-to masturbation techniquesSee all the times she's exposed the confidential secrets from her personal lifeAt the height of her Hollywood career, Gwyneth Paltrow was making headlines for her award-winning on-screen roles.",
        "But since she stepped back from acting career to forge a new role for herself as a lifestyle guru, the mother-of-two has found a much more scandalous way to court attention - by spilling intimate details about her sex life.\u00a0Just this week, the 50-year-old caused quite the stir when she candidly opened up about her past relationships with Brad Pitt and Ben Affleck - going as far as to reveal which of the on-screen stars was 'better in bed' and who of the two was the 'best kisser'.\u00a0The admissions, made during an appearance on the sex-focused podcast Call Her Daddy, was the latest in a very long line of brazen 'bare it all' confessions from Gwynnie, who has in recent years readily offered up all manner of anecdotes about the most intimate aspects of her life, from her sex toy preferences to her pre-bedtime masturbation rituals.",
        "Since launching her lifestyle brand Goop 2008, Gwyneth has become an increasingly extroverted over-sharer,\u00a0sharing lists of her favorite vibrators and providing tips on how her readers can improve their libido and have more fun in the bedroom - whether it's with a partner or by themselves.The mother-of-two has sparked backlash for promoting a slew of controversial and eye-brow raising practices over the years - like the time she encouraged her fans to try 'touchless orgasms' and when she gushed over something called 'sex dust,' which she said she sprinkled into her smoothies to 'stimulate and cultivate sexual flow.'",
        "In addition, her company was once sued after it claimed that sticking a piece of jade or quartz into your genitalia would 'balance hormones, regulate menstrual cycles, prevent uterine prolapse, and increase bladder control.'Doctors warned that it could cause toxic shock syndrome, and Goop eventually agreed to pay a $145,000 fine - however, Gwyneth still sticks by the product.The Hollywood starlet has admitted to participating in many other peculiar health trends over the years - including\u00a0steam-cleaning her vagina and putting ozone up her butt.She also made headlines when she released a candle that supposedly smells like her vagina, which was followed up with one that was orgasm scented.Gwyneth has certainly kept very little from her fans, and while some have praised the Iron Man star for her openness, some of Gwyneth's most-raunchy revelations - like her go-to masturbation technique or favorite sex toy - have left people cringing.As Gwyneth gets candid about her previous romances with Ben and Brad, FEMAIL went ahead and recapped the many other times that she's fearlessly exposed the confidential secrets from her personal life.Gwyneth once admitted that she loves to steam-clean her vagina because she said it 'balances her female hormones' and causes an 'energetic release'",
        "Gwyneth received a lot of attention online when she revealed in 2015 that she loves to steam-clean her vagina - and suggested that her readers do the same.",
        "'You sit on what is essentially a mini-throne, and a combination of infrared and mugwort steam cleanses your uterus,' she wrote on Goop.'It is an energetic release \u2013 not just a steam douche \u2013 that balances female hormone levels.'According to Healthline, 'There\u2019s no scientific evidence that vaginal steaming helps any condition.'Your vagina isn\u2019t meant to be steam-cleaned. Vaginal steaming may disrupt the natural pH produced by the vaginal microbiome, therefore providing an ideal environment for bacteria that cause vaginal infections to thrive,' the publication stated.",
        "'Vaginal skin is delicate, sensitive, and easily traumatized. Using it as target practice for a plume of warm steam may cause vaginal burns or scalding.'\u00a0While speaking to The Cut about it months later, Gwyneth defended the controversial practice - which is also used by Chrissy Teigen.At the time, Gwyneth insisted that it has 'real healing qualities' and that while she was weirded out by it at first, she fell in love with it after trying it.'The first time I tried v-steaming, I was like, \"This is insane.\" My friend Ben brought me and I was like, \"You are out of your f**king mind. What is this?\"' explained the actress. 'But then by the end of it I was like, \"This is so great.\"",
        "'Then I start to do research, and it\u2019s been in Korean medicine for thousands of years and there are real healing properties. If I find benefit to it and it\u2019s getting a lot of page views, it\u2019s a win-win.'\u00a0The Goop founder has promoted a slew of erotic products - including 'sex dust' and vibrators - and once came under fire for suggesting women put a jade egg into their vaginas\u00a0",
        "Through her website, Gwyneth often shares lists of her favorite sex toys and vibrators - but some of her suggestions have sparked immense backlash for the star.\u00a0In 2018, Gwyneth promoted something known as a Yoni egg on Goop - which ultimately resulted in the company having to fork over $145,000 in fines.",
        "The egg, which ranges in price from $55 to $66, is usually made of quartz or jade.\u00a0Goop claimed on its website that if a woman inserts one into her vagina, it would 'balance hormones, regulate menstrual cycles, prevent uterine prolapse, and increase bladder control.'But its claims resulted in the company being sued by a consumer watchdog called Truth in Advertising, who said Goop\u00a0'was misleading consumers by making statements not backed by scientific evidence,' per\u00a0Vox.\u00a0Goop ultimately reached a settlement and agreed to pay the $145,000.\u00a0'Jade is porous which could allow bacteria to get inside and so the egg could act like a fomite,' one gynecologist, named Dr. Jen Gunter, said\u00a0at the time.\u00a0",
        "'This is not good. It could be a risk factor for bacterial vaginosis or even the potentially deadly toxic shock syndrome.'Even so, the Yoni eggs are still available to purchase on Goop's website.",
        "'Yoni eggs harness the power of energy work, crystal healing, and a Kegel-like physical practice,' reads a description.\u00a0'Insert the egg into your vagina and feel the connection with your body by squeezing and releasing the egg.'While speaking about it to the New York Times in 2021, Gwyneth defended the egg, explaining that the lawsuit was simply the result of Goop being 'a little company curating and buying third-party brands that were making claims around their products,' rather than something wrong with the actual product.'We've come a really long way from being that small start-up. Even with the Yoni eggs. That was really around claims, but it didn't involve the product,' she insisted.\u00a0'That egg is not dangerous. We still sell it.'\u00a0Gwyneth has also promoted something known as 'sex dust' on Goop -\u00a0a $60 powder made from a slew of herbs including Ho Shou Wu, Cistanche, Cacao, Shilajit, Maca, Epimedium, and Schisandra.Made by the company Moon Juice, it is said to 'stimulate and cultivate sexual flow in both men and women.'Gwyneth said she loved to sprinkle some in her morning smoothies in a post about the product shared in 2016.",
        "Through Goop, Gwyneth has also released her own $96 double-sided wand vibrator and a female libido-boosting supplement called DTF - an acronym for 'down to f**k.'\u00a0Gwyneth has been very open about her love of masturbation, and once admitted that she loves to use sex toys and climax before bed",
        "Gwyneth also often shares tips on improving your libido and having more fun in the bedroom via Goop - whether it's with a partner or by yourself.One recent article posted by the lifestyle brand is titled, 'How touching yourself - together - can reignite your sexual connection,' while another is called, 'The key to satisfying sex, according to four experts.'She's also gotten real about her own sexual endeavors over the years, revealing in 2021 that she was having the 'best sex of her life' following her marriage to Brad Falchuk three years prior.\u00a0In a post shared in October of that year, the actress also shared her love for orgasms while touting the benefits of climaxing before going to bed.'With an orgasm, you relax. Get in the body. You can\u2019t be thinking about anything else when you\u2019re having an orgasm,' she explained.\u00a0'You\u2019re a total mammal at that point. It\u2019s like Mary Oliver said: \"You only have to let the soft animal of your body love what it loves.\"'She also told People in 2021,\u00a0'Repressing sexuality and specifically female pleasure has been a mechanism of control for a long time.\u00a0'I'm an advocate for women to listen to themselves and become close and intimate with themselves.",
        "'It's time to undo those tropes. If a woman likes sex, there's nothing wrong with her.''I want to give everyone permission to be brave and connect with themselves and ask crazy questions. Sex can be a fascinating barometer for how honest you're being in your own life.'Last year, after Goop launched its own vibrator, Gwyneth also admitted to using sex toys while masturbating.While promoting the product, which costs $98, the star said she was no stranger to raunchy products, explaining that\u00a0she's 'tested a lot of them out over the years'\u00a0and that it inspired her to want to create one that 'lead to great orgasms.'\u00a0Most recently, the Iron Man alum launched a separate Instagram account, called\u00a0Goopsex, which is dedicated purely to speaking about sex and helping others find 'pleasure.'\u00a0'Something we believe in at Goop is that true fulfilment comes from really knowing yourself and feeling comfortable enough to show up in the world and in your relationships as your whole self,' she said when it was released last month.\u00a0'An important pillar of this is how we feel about our sexuality. Goopsex is a place for the pursuit of pleasure, where you can stay up to date on our latest content covering sex, intimacy and relationships.'The actress raised eyebrows when she showed a woman masturbating and having an orgasm in her Netflix show - which also featured an expert in 'touchless orgasms'",
        "Gwyneth got even more intimate with her fans when she released a Netflix docuseries called\u00a0The Goop Lab in early 2020 - and one episode was focused primarily on masturbation.The actress sat down with sex educators\u00a0Betty Dodson and Carlin Ross during the episode, who gave detailed instructions on how to achieve an orgasm using a unique technique known as the Betty Dodson method.The women then demonstrated it, masturbating until she reached an orgasm, all of which was captured on camera and shown in the show.'The goal was to find a way to explore female anatomy for our female viewership that felt not exploitative, not titillating, not clinical, not cheesy, but very powerful,' producer Shauna Minoprio said to Vulture afterwards.'We wanted to find a way to take ownership of female pleasure for ourselves as a group of female filmmakers.'",
        "In Gwyneth's follow-up show, entitled\u00a0Sex, Love, and Goop, which came out in 2021, she set out on a quest to help five couples who were struggling with intimacy issues.Along the way, she chatted with numerous experts - but when one sexologist, named Jaiya, spoke in detail about achieving an orgasm without being touched during the show, it raised some eyebrows.'Orgasm doesn't have to be slot A goes into slot B,' Jaiya said in the series. 'It could be anywhere on their body.'\u00a0She explained that there are 'five different erotic blueprints,' including something she referred to as 'energetic touch,' which involves feeling someone's energy without actually touching them.'It\u2019s all about the anticipation. The craving,' she added.Jaiya showcased her practices in the show, leading her partner Ian as he helped another woman to orgasm by moving his hands above his body - but the two never come in contact.The mother-of-two released a candle that smelled like her vagina in an attempt to end the 'shame' surrounding women's bodies - and it sold out within minutes",
        "In January 2020, Gwyneth took things to the next level when she released a scented candle that smelled like her vagina.Entitled This Smells Like My Vagina, the $75 candle sold out within minutes.\u00a0The scent is described as 'funny, gorgeous, sexy, and beautifully unexpected' on Goop's website.\u00a0While visiting the\u00a0Late Night With Seth Meyers a few weeks after its released, Gwyneth admitted that she and her team came up with the candle when they were high on psychedelic.'I smelled this beautiful thing and I said, \"This smells like my vagina.\" But I was kidding. We were on mushrooms,' she explained. 'Next thing I know it's on my website.'However, she stood by the candle, explaining that she released it because she feels there's a 'certain degree of shame' surrounding the female body, which she hopes to put an end to.\u00a0While speaking to the Today show in 2022, Gwyneth added that she wanted the message behind the candle to be, 'It\u2019s amazing to be a woman in every way. It\u2019s amazing to have that kind of power and you deserve to have that agency.'\u00a0Naturally, she followed it up with another candle called This Smells Like My Orgasm.\u00a0Gwynnie once admitted to shooting ozone into her butt - insisting that while it's 'weird,' the strange practice 'helped' her a lot",
        "Back in March, Gwyneth made another shocking admission - she once shot ozone up her butt.When asked what the weirdest wellness technique that she tried was during an appearance on Dear Media's podcast The Art of Being Well, she said it was probably rectal ozone therapy -\u00a0a procedure where the supercharged oxygen is delivered via catheter into the colon.'It's pretty weird. It's pretty weird, yeah. But it's been very helpful,' she said, but didn't share any more details.'Ozone\u00a0is a molecule made up of three oxygen atoms,' Health Essentials said of the practice.\u00a0'It\u2019s highly unstable and explosive in liquid or solid form. But as a gas, this supercharged oxygen may potentially have therapeutic qualities.'Some believe that ozone gas can be administered through ozone therapy to heal wounds, relieve pain, and treat disease. But this remains a controversial practice given limited evidence on its safety.'The publication added that some potential risks include air bubbles forming in your veins or arteries and 'flu-like symptoms.''Breathing in medical-grade ozone, even in very low doses, is harmful,' it added. 'Short-term exposure to a small amount of ozone can cause severe and permanent damage to your lungs and respiratory system.'Her risqu\u00e9 confessions have left her own family members mortified - with the actress admitting her 'proper' mother is always 'shocked' by the things she discusses on Goop while her son was 'embarrassed' by her selling vibrators online",
        "While some have praised Gwyneth for her openness, the actress' risqu\u00e9 confessions\u00a0 have left others uncomfortable - including her own family members.She admitted in April 2021 that her mom,\u00a0Blythe Danner, is 'always' left shocked by the content on her lifestyle platform.Gwyneth told the Today show, 'She is [proper], but even proper ladies have sexuality too.'She also admitted during an appearance on\u00a0Jimmy Kimmel Live! in February 2020 that her then-13-year-old son, Moses, was mortified about her selling sex toys online at first.However, she added that he soon came to see it as a 'bada** feminist' move.'My son said to me the other day, he was like, \"At first I thought it was really embarrassing that there were vibrators on your website and now I think it\u2019s a great thing,\"' she said. 'He\u2019s like, \"You\u2019re a feminist, Mom. You\u2019re a bad**.\"'When it comes to how she approaches talking about sex with her kids, Moses, who is now age 17, and Apple, now 18, Gwyneth said she tries to 'stay neutral on the topic.''I think my generation, we got a lot of messages around sex that made us feel bad about it,' she explained to\u00a0Entertainment Tonight\u00a0in 2021.",
        "'I try to just be curious, but teenagers are never going to want to talk to their parents about sex, ever.'I sort of follow their lead and luckily, in middle school, they had a very thorough sex education, so the school handled the kind of birds and the bees parts. Then I am there for any questions, but the questions are pretty minimal.'\u00a0Gwyneth added that she\u00a0advises her children to trust their instincts and make decisions based on how they feel.\u00a0'I think the main thing that nobody ever tells you is, you have to stay really close to your own truth and you have to stay really in integrity with that truth,' she said.\u00a0'Because when you are in a relationship and you are not being your full self, you are sublimating things or you are white knuckling through something, and I think it can be pretty damaging to how you feel about yourself.'I will always just encourage my children to really listen to themselves, listen to their instincts, listen if something feels right, and to act from that place.'\u00a0"
