Another primary unit at the plant has capacity of 3.6 million tonnes per year.That cooler could be replaced within a couple of weeks, though the impact is yet to be fully accessed, the source added.The press service at the plant was not immediately available for comments.The Ilsky refinery, near the Black Sea port of Novorossiisk in the Krasnodar region, has a processing capacity of around 6.6 million tonnes per year.
