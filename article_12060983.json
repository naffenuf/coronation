        "Scotland\u2019s First Minister has said the arrest of the SNP\u2019s former chief executive was \u201cgut-wrenching\u201d.",
        "Humza Yousaf made the comments in an interview with Holyrood magazine, published on Monday, when he was asked about what he thought when he found out Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s husband had been arrested.\u201cIt was really gut-wrenching, actually; I make no bones about it. I have known Peter and Nicola for many, many years. They are friends of mine. They are people that have helped me throughout my political career. And, frankly, I couldn\u2019t quite believe the news,\u201d he told the magazine.Mr Murrell was released without charge pending further investigation.Mr Yousaf, who took over from Ms Sturgeon as both First Minister and SNP party leader in March, said he was \u201conly in control of what I\u2019m in control of\u201d and that the \u201cgovernment side of things has gone quite well\u201d since he took office.",
        "\u201cI would say that, of course, but I think we\u2019ve been able to send clear signals about what we\u2019re intending to come forward with in terms of some of the early policies which drive that direction of travel; we\u2019ve been able to begin the process of refresh and resetting some of the important relationships with business, and the like, but yes, I feel frustration, of course, that it has been overshadowed, totally, by what\u2019s happened in the past,\u201d he told the magazine.",
        "\u201cNo, I don\u2019t feel betrayal. Frustration, for sure. Not betrayal. But frustration over issues that started even before the election contest finished with the membership numbers debacle, it just didn\u2019t have to happen and led to a whole disruption within the party.\u201cFrustration, when I think about the legitimate press questions about when the auditor resigned and why did the party not know about it?\u201cWhy did members not know about it? And what\u2019s been going on for six months since that has happened?\u201cSo, I definitely feel a sense of frustration. Not betrayal, but selfishly, a frustration that this is going on while I also have a big job to do to lead the country.\u201d"
