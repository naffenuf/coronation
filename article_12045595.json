Ooh baby number two!' And I'll go into detail another time, but even my experience of trying for a baby I found it really hard. I actually found it really emotional.'I think it's important that the whole trying for a baby, certain things we were doing, that's a whole other topic.She continued: 'The news is finally out. I'm so relieved to be able to just be myself, not wearing a baggy top.'I've had quite a lot of message over the last few weeks of people saying 'Are you pregnant?'
