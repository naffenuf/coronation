        "A total of almost 2,000 people participated in events in Ballater, near Balmoral, and in the village of Gartocharn on the banks of Loch Lomond on Sunday.",
        "The Coronation Big Lunch, an idea by the Eden Project and made possible by the National Lottery, was set up as a way of reducing loneliness and supporting charities and good causes.In Ballater, which sits in the heart of Royal Deeside and on the doorstep of Balmoral, around 1,500 people turned out for a Coronation Big Lunch picnic.David Corbyn, who helped organise the event, said: \u201cBecause of Ballater\u2019s long association with the royal family it\u2019s a bit more personal here.",
        "\u201cWe feel an affinity with the royal family, we have a strong respect for them and they have for us, so this is a celebration of everything they\u2019ve achieved and what they are now about to as King and Queen.\u201cIt\u2019s a great opportunity for us to come together and show our appreciation.\u201d",
        "Elsewhere in Scotland, more than 300 people turned out for a Coronation Big Lunch in Gartocharn \u2013 with bouncy castles and ice-cream.James MacRae, 82, and the driving force behind the event, said: \u201cThese events are important because they pull a community together.\u201cI feel on an occasion like a coronation, particularly a once in 70-year coronation, that we must have an event.\u201d",
        "Grainne McCloskey, Scotland Regional Manager at Eden Project Communities, who are behind The Big Lunch, said she hoped it would become an annual celebration.She said: \u201cCommunity spirit is at the heart of this historic occasion and today was another opportunity for people to strengthen that community spirit while enjoying the celebrations.\u201cWe hope organisers will go on to make The Big Lunch an annual celebration of friendship, togetherness and neighbourhood.\u201d"
