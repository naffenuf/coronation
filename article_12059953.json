        "Stevenage boss Steve Evans stressed his side were never going to \u201cgo through the motions\u201d at Barrow after signing off their promotion-winning campaign with a 1-0 victory.",
        "He also revealed that the Boro team bus had been transformed into a karaoke party for the long trip back south as he paid tribute to his \u201cfantastic to a man\u201d squad.Nearly 600 Stevenage supporters travelled up to see their team, who had already secured automatic promotion, seal second place behind champions Leyton Orient with victory in Cumbria.Jake Reeves\u2019 first goal since December, which came in the club\u2019s 5-0 rout over the Bluebirds, settled the final-day encounter at Holker Street with Barrow unable to find a way past Stevenage keeper Adam Przybek.Evans said: \u201cWe were never going to just go through the motions.\u201cWe realised early on that last season 32 supporters came to watch Stevenage at Barrow and it was almost 600 today.",
        "\u201cThat tells you that we\u2019re indebted to the supporters for travelling.\u201cAdam\u2019s made a few saves in the second half, but if we take our chances it\u2019s as comfortable an away win as we\u2019ve had in a while.\u201cWe got a real good shift from everyone. We utilised the squad today.\u201cI would have loved to have got some more of the young lads on, but we didn\u2019t have that freedom unfortunately.\u201cI thanked the players and I told them the team bus doesn\u2019t exist anymore, it\u2019s the karaoke party bus all the way back to Stevenage.",
        "\u201cThey deserve it. They have been fantastic to a man, every single one of them.\u201dPete Wild\u2019s Barrow ended the season in ninth spot, their highest Football League finish since way back in 1970.It has been a huge achievement to lift the club towards the play-offs this season after they just about survived in both previous campaigns since getting promoted from non-league in 2020.Wild said: \u201cWe\u2019ve gone toe-to-toe with Stevenage and just not been able to get over the line.\u201cI think that sums our season up. They had one chance and it goes in, we have six or seven chances and they don\u2019t go in.\u201cWe all know that\u2019s the area we\u2019ve got to get better at.\u201cThe lads have had a go and taken it to Stevenage.\u201cOnce the goal went in the place just slumped. We said at half-time that you can stroll around for 45 minutes and it will take forever or you can run around and see where it takes us.\u201cOne of my big phrases is \u2018judge me after 46 games, not week-by-week\u2019 and my 46-game record is OK.\u201cI\u2019m quite happy with what\u2019s happened this season. Am I happy with ninth? No, I want to be higher.\u201cIt\u2019s been tough these last couple of weeks because I\u2019ve never not been playing for something on the last day.",
        "\u201cBut there\u2019s a lot of positives to take from this season. We\u2019re all clear with where we need to improve and that\u2019s part of the process.\u201cWe\u2019re a work in progress and have travelled a country mile this season and we\u2019ve got to do that again to get to where we want to be.\u201d"
