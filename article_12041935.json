        "Mazepin, 24, who used to drive for the Haas Formula 1 Team, wants sanctions lifted and has taken legal action against Foreign Secretary James Cleverly.A judge considered preliminary issues at a High Court hearing in London on Wednesday.",
        "Mr Justice Chamberlain heard that Mazepin and his father Dmitry Mazepin\u00a0 \u2013 a Russian businessman \u2013 had been made subject to sanctions in mid-March 2022.In September 2022, Mazepin had requested \u201crevocation of his designation\u201d but ministers had decided to \u201ctake no action\u201d.A judge is due to oversee a further hearing in London in June.Mr Justice Chamberlain was told that Mazepin was involved in a similar bid to get sanctions lifted in Canada.Neither Mazepin nor his father were at the hearing.",
        "Barrister Tom Leary, who represented Mr Cleverly, told the judge that Haas had \u201cterminated its relationship\u201d with Mazepin in early March 2022, following the outbreak of war.He said Mazepin had not driven for a Formula 1 team since.Mazepin and his father were \u201csubject to an asset freeze and travel ban\u201d, the judge was told.Mr Leary indicated that one of the reasons Mazepin wanted sanctions lifted was so that he could travel to Britain to negotiate with race teams for the 2024 season.Mr Justice Chamberlain suggested that a trial judge might have to stage part of the proceedings in private in order to consider any \u201cclosed\u201d material presented by ministers.",
        " (Mazepin) missed the 2022 season and, almost certainly, the 2023 season and, whilst those sanctions are in place, no Formula 1 team will take him on as a test, reserve or full driver  Barrister Rachel Scott, representing Mazepin  Barrister Rachel Scott, who represented Mazepin, told Mr Justice Chamberlain in a written case outline: \u201cThe UK sanctions to which he has been made subject, alongside the imposition of restrictive measures at EU level, effectively ended his racing career.\u201cHe missed the 2022 season and, almost certainly, the 2023 season and, whilst those sanctions are in place, no Formula 1 team will take him on as a test, reserve or full driver.\u201dShe added: \u201cThe claimant will, in effect, be unable to negotiate a place on a Formula 1 team for 2024 unless he is free to travel to and from the UK to attend negotiations at teams\u2019 bases in the UK, bearing in mind that seven of the 10 teams are based in the UK.\u201cNegotiations to join a Formula 1 team usually begin in May or June of the previous year. Thereafter he must be able to enter the UK, not just for the British Formula 1 race, but for briefings, ergonomics design work, training and attending the team\u2019s base.\u201d"
