        "Tom Cruise took to the skies on Sunday when he won the MTV Award for Best Performance in a Movie for Top Gun: Maverick.",
        "In a pre-recorded video message, the 60-year-old superstar piloted a vintage fighter plane with his golden popcorn trophy and thanked his massive fanbase for the win.'Hi, everyone, thank you so much for this award,' the perennial A-lister declared. 'I make these films for you. I love you. I love entertaining you. How much you enjoy it, how much you appreciate it. There is no better feeling and I hope you enjoy this.Tom went on to plug his new Mission: Impossible film by proclaiming, 'Dead reckoning coming out in July. It's a wild ride. Have a wonderful summer. Thank you again for letting me entertain you. It's an absolute privilege. We'll see you at the movies.'The iconic star bested fellow nominees\u00a0Austin Butler (Elvis), Florence Pugh (Don\u2019t Worry Darling), KeKe Palmer (Nope) and Michael B. Jordan (Creed III).",
        "The high-flying stunt marks the second time Cruise has employed the gag this weekend, as he also sent King Charles a similar message for his coronation.Piloting the same P-51 Mustang, the War of the Worlds star told the monarch: 'Your Majesty, you can be my wingman anytime!'Fan reaction on Twitter was initially mixed, as some praised the star for his MTV Awards win, while others rolled their eyes at the ploy.\u00a0",
        "'Hey this is the same clip from the coronation!' crowed one viewer, while another tweeted: 'WAHHOOOOO CONGRATULATIONS TC.'Some viewers were a bit peeved that Elvis star Austin Butler was 'robbed,' with one fan tweeting: 'Austin should have won!!'But Tom certainly isn't sweating any social media sniping, as the megastar is hard at work on Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part Two, the grand finale to his blockbuster franchise.Cruise, who is known for doing his own stunts, initially began developing his passion for flying during the production of his 1986 classic hit Top Gun.The action star received his license in 1994, and is believed to own two additional aircrafts in addition to his flashy P-51 Mustang.",
        "The 2023 MTV Movie &amp; TV Awards is one of the first victims of the ongoing dispute between the\u00a0Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers and the Writers Guild of America union.Writers are now on strike and picketing studios, leading the host Drew Barrymore to announce that she was dropping out last Sunday.The actress-turned-talk show host had been set to MC the festivities, but she is now putting her clout behind writers struggling to earn better pay and guarantees on staffing, as studios increasingly try to limit the size of writers' rooms and shrink the number of episodes per series.\u00a0",
        "The labor action has also led the awards show to cancel its red carpet festivities, as many other stars also dropped out to support the strikers.\u00a0",
