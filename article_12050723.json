        "Brisbane 4BC radio host Neil Breen quit his show live on air on Friday.\u00a0",
        "The shock jock, who hosts 4BC's weekday afternoon show Brisbane Live, told his listeners that he would not be returning to his show in an emotional announcement.\u00a0He said it had been a 'tough three years' since the Covid-19 pandemic, and he wanted to prioritise his family.\u00a0Before the pandemic, the radio presenter was living in Brisbane five days a week and travelling back to Sydney at the weekend to be with his wife and children.\u00a0When travelling between states became restricted, Breen tried to move his family to Queensland, but it proved difficult.",
        "The radio host said he became very lonely during the pandemic, as his family were stuck in a different state to him.'It was a very tough time because of Covid and all the rules, it was very difficult to get my family here,' he said on air on Friday.'It's taken it's toll and I've told the bosses at Channel Nine I'm going to resign from 4BC radio,' he said.'It's very sad for me and I think it's going to be quite upsetting for a lot of the listeners.'",
        "'Please don't think I take it for granted, I see your emails and I hear the phone calls and I get the texts and I know you enjoy the show.'\u00a0",
        "The presenter will finish at 4BC on June 23, and he hinted that he may be back on Sydney's 2GB as he hopes to spend more time with his family there.\u00a0He added: 'I've given you three of the best years I can possibly give to you but it's time for me to give many, many more years than that to my family and dedication to my family and be with them seven days a week.\u00a0'I have made this decision as a personal decision just for my own peace of mind really.'"
