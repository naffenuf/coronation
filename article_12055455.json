Send your pictures and videos to pictures@mailonline.co.uk\u00a0Katy Perry\u00a0was spotted taking a picture of herself on Westminster Abbey's memorial to Winston Churchill yesterday - just hours after being mocked for failing to find her seat - and later tripping in her heels outside.",
        "The 'California Gurls' singer, who will perform at the Coronation Concert at Windsor Castle\u00a0today, took a quick snap of her feet while she stood on the stone dedicated to the wartime Prime Minister.The singer was dressed head-to-toe in lilac with an enormous headpiece and Vivienne Westwood choker and was spotted taking selfies with guests in the historic abbey.The picture of\u00a0 her feet while standing on Churchill's memorial was later published on Perry's Instagram page, alongside several snaps of the singer on the day of the Coronation.In one picture, she posed outside Westminster Abbey while standing on one foot, with her hands framing the church.",
        "Her post also included a video of herself and Vogue editor-in-chief Edward Enninful, OBE saying 'we're here' as they were standing outside Westminster Abbey.She said in the post's caption: 'Was such an honour to be able to watch history being made today at the coronation of King Charles III!\u00a0'I am grateful to have been invited by the King on behalf of the @thebritishasiantrust and their Children Protect Fund, an organisation I've deeply believed in and have been fortunate to support for the last 3 years.'Earlier yesterday, Perry was caught by amused fans looking like a lost lamb searching far and wide for her seat.",
        "Unable to see thanks to an impressive fascinator, she was seen cocking her head and spinning around in circles in desperate search for her place.She comically tweeted following the ceremony that her fans were 'not to worry' as she found her seat and was later seen stumbling in her tall white heels as she left the ceremony with fellow guests.Alongside Vogue's\u00a0Enninful, the pop star was pictured arriving at the abbey earlier yesterday morning.\u00a0It was also revealed that she would stay at Windsor Castle last night before performing today alongside music legend Lionel Richie, as well as Take That, Italian opera singer Andrea Bocelli and Welsh bass-baritone Sir Bryn Terfel.\u00a0",
        "The event, which will take place in the grounds of Windsor Castle, will be in front of a crowd of 20,000 members of the public and invited guests and broadcast across BBC television and radio stations.As a special honour in return for her performance, Katy is being allowed an exclusive stay in the royal residence of the 1,000-year-old castle.Perry said she is 'really excited' for her 'wild' sleepover at the royal residence.\u00a0'I'm really excited\u2026 I might be posting a lot because I'm gonna be in a castle, for real. This is wild,' she told Extra TV.\u00a0",
        "Asked about her Coronation invite, she said:\u00a0'It was very regal. It was like a cursive I have never seen [before]\u2026 I loved it.'",
        "The 38-year-old paid homage to Vivienne Westwood in her lilac outfit from the late designer.She showcased her slim frame in a pencil dress teamed with a co-ordinating short-sleeved jacket, boasting a nipped-in waist, and matching opera gloves.She accessorised with an enormous dish-style net fascinator, while wearing a Vivienne Westwood necklace and carrying her belongings in a white top-handle bag from the designer.Perry arrived alongside VIP guests who since 6am were queuing for a mile to get one of the prime 2,300 seats inside. The Abbey was full at just before 9am.Stars seen taking their seats in the church included Katy Perry, Lionel Richie, Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber, Stephen Fry, Nick Cave and magician Dynamo, while\u00a0Dame Emma Thompson gave a thumbs up in excitement.TV favourites Ant and Dec, along with Repair Shop star Jay Blades, were also in attendance at the service, which is set to be seen by more than 100million people around the world.\u00a0They watched Charles be crowned in a Christian ceremony that dates back for 1,000 years on a day dripping with\u00a0glorious displays of pageantry.\u00a0It also shone a spotlight on Britain\u2019s place on the world stage in the UK's biggest ceremonial military operation since the state funeral of Sir Winston Churchill in 1965 with\u00a07,000 servicemen and women marching with the King and Queen."
