Millions will be watching at home tonight, but tens of thousands have been in Windsor since early this morning to see pop icons Lionel Richie, Katy Perry and Take That perform in a star-studded bash.And to show their appreciation, William and Kate greeted crowds, shaking hands and chatting to revellers in some welcome sunshine after a rainy Coronation day.
