        "Biden on Monday summoned the four top congressional leaders to the White House next week. The president will discuss \"initiating a separate budget process\" during this meeting, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said.\"This is not an issue that we will negotiate on,\" Jean-Pierre said. \"The debt limit was increased three times under former president Donald Trump, she added.
