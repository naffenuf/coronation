        "The full list of Wetherspoon pubs that are under off has been revealed\u00a0The pub giant revealed last year it would be selling dozens of its beloved boozersFans of a cheap pint may have to find a new local as the full list of even more at-risk Wetherspoon pubs has been released.",
        "There are currently 19 of the pub giant's boozers under offer, while twenty have already closed for good.Last November, Wetherspoons announced it was in the process of selling 39 of its pubs due to its inability to match\u00a0its pre-pandemic performance.\u00a0It was revealed in September that 32 of its pubs would close, before a further seven sites got set for the axe in November.Pubs such as The General Sir Redvers Buller in Crediton and The John Masefield in New Ferry are under offer, while the likes of Plough and Harrow in Hammersmith and Wrong 'Un in Bexleyheath are still up for sale, according to The Sun.",
        "The pubs that are under off could still remain open if a sale doesn't complete, as this means the seller is considering the offer.Other Wetherspoon establishments have already started to close, with 20 so far having shut their doors. These include\u00a0The Worlds Inn in Romford,\u00a0Chapel an Gansblydhen in Bodmin and\u00a0The Sir John Stirling Maxwell in Glasgow.The list of Wetherspoon pubs up for sale and under offer can be found on the JD Wetherspoon Disposals website.\u00a0In January, the pub chain said sales jumped at the end of 2022 but it is still struggling to keep up with its pre-pandemic performance.Like-for-like sales rose 18 per cent in the last quarter of 2022 at the firm's 844 pubs, but are still 2 per cent behind 2019 levels.",
        "Wetherspoon also noted that costs were far higher than three years ago, especially for labour, food, energy and maintenance.",
        "Its chairman Tim Martin said: 'The aftermath of the pandemic and lockdown restrictions have been far more difficult than anyone thought. That is the picture for the whole pub and restaurant industry.'People thought that after lockdown there would be a boom in people suffering from cabin fever but, instead, it has almost been the opposite situation as people have got in the habit of staying in.'But the crisis extends further than just everyone's favourite bargain boozer.\u00a0Hospitality businesses across the country have been forced to shut in the past year due to crippling inflation costs and energy prices.\u00a0In January to March of this year alone,\u00a0756 hospitality venues shut their doors for good.\u00a0New research by industry experts CGA by NIQ and AlixPartners has revealed that almost 4,600 venues closed across all corners of the country from March 2022 to 2023 at a staggering rate of 12 a day.\u00a0Profits have further been impacted by the changing behaviour of consumers, specifically families, who are eating out less due to their pockets being squeezed amid the cost of living crisis.\u00a0",
