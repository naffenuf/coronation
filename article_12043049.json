        "The Republic of Ireland tops this ranking, with searches for UK flights up 580 per cent after May 6 was confirmed as the Coronation date.The second biggest search surge came for domestic travel within the UK (442 per cent), followed by searches from Italy (third, 355 per cent), Spain (fourth, 349 per cent) and the Netherlands (fifth, 313 per cent).The remaining top 10 countries to have booked the most UK-bound flights are Nigeria (sixth), South Korea (seventh), Germany (eighth), Thailand (ninth) and Spain (10th)."
