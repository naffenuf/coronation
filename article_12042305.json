        "Bolsonaro, who tested positive for the coronavirus on multiple occasions and compared the virus to 'a little flu,' told a bevy of reporters that he was 'surprised' by the raid at his Brasilia home. His cellphone was seized during the raid.'There was no adulteration on my part, it didn't happen,' he said. 'I didn't take the vaccine, period. I never denied that.'The former far-right leader also confirmed that his daughter never received the vaccine.",
