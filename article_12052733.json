        "A video recording of former US president Donald Trump being questioned about the rape allegations against him was made public for the first time on Friday, providing a glimpse of the Republican\u2019s emphatic denials.",
        "Jurors got to see the video of Mr Trump\u2019s October 2022 deposition over the past few days at the trial over a lawsuit filed against him by advice columnist E Jean Carroll.Written transcripts of Mr Trump\u2019s evidence had also previously been made public, but not the recording itself.The video was made available on Friday to news organisations covering the proceedings.",
        "The video shows Mr Trump answering questions in his trademark navy suit and a bright blue tie. He called Ms Carroll\u2019s claim that he raped her in a luxury Manhattan department store \u201ca false, disgusting lie\u201d.\u201cIt\u2019s a disgrace. Frankly it\u2019s a disgrace that something like this can be brought,\u201d Mr Trump said.Mr Trump reiterated his assertion that Ms Carroll is \u201cnot my type,\u201d but also mistook her for his second wife, Marla Maples, when shown a photo of him meeting Ms Carroll and her then-husband at an event in the 1980s.Mr Trump was also asked about the infamous \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d video in which he bragged about grabbing women\u2019s genitals.He said, as he has previously, that he was was engaging in \u201clocker room talk\u201d.Mr Trump justified his comments about famous people being able to have their way with women, saying: \u201cHistorically, that\u2019s true with stars.\u201d",
        "All planned testimony in the trial concluded on Thursday, clearing the way for closing arguments by the lawyers to happen on Monday barring a last-minute decision by Mr Trump to give evidence."
