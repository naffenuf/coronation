        "Sam Hoskins' early goal\u00a0for the Cobblers was enough to prevent a late challenge from Stockport on Monday, in a win that will come as an immense relief to fans after missing out on third place on the last day of the season last year.The Hatters ended up four points behind after they could only muster a 1-1 draw with already-relegated Hartlepool, and will have to rely on the play-offs to work their way into League One.They will face Salford, who clung on to seventh place despite losing 1-0 to Gillingham, in the first leg this weekend.It was a heartbreaking result for Mansfied fans, as the Stags' were left level on points\u00a0 with the Ammies with a goal difference deficit of just one after their 2-0 win at Colchester.",
