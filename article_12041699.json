        "The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has launched a comparison tool to show how much everyday items have increased during the cost-of-living crisis.It comes after UK Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation peaked at 11.1% late last year and food prices continued to soar.Grocery inflation leapt by more than 19% in March compared with a year ago, as energy and supply chain costs were passed on to shoppers.The ONS said the new tool will allow Britons to select from more than 450 items, ranging from cheddar cheese to MOTs, to track their own inflation.Around 95% of the items used in the tool have seen their price increase in the year to March 2023.",
        "The data, which uses the CPIH (Consumer Prices Index including Housing) measure of inflation, highlights stark jumps in the cost of groceries and eating out.Over the year, 60 grocery products used in the tool saw prices jump by 20% or more, including five items that rose by 40% or more.The price of cheddar cheese jumped by 42% for the year, while white sliced bread saw a 29% price increase.Meanwhile, the cost of a fry up \u2013 sausages, bacon, eggs, baked beans and toast \u2013 leapt by 24%.
