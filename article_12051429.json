        "The Princess of Wales has described the King\u2019s coronation as a \u201cgreat moment for celebration\u201d as the Prince praised The Mall\u2019s \u201cparty atmosphere\u201d.",
        "William and Kate joined the King for a surprise walkabout in The Mall meeting royalists who have staked their spot on the famous London thoroughfare.With Prince George set to play a starring role in the coronation and Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis expected to attend the historic event, the princess revealed her children were \u201ca bit nervous\u201d and \u201cexcited\u201d and could not wait for the day.",
        "The King shook dozens of outstretched hands and laughed when one man asked if he was \u201cnervous for tomorrow\u201d, while another royal fan with a strong accent said: \u201cLove you, I\u2019m from Italy,\u201d and a third told the King, \u201cGood luck for tomorrow\u201d.Charles took a break from a busy schedule of meetings and official engagements, including a final coronation rehearsal at Westminster Abbey, to go on the walkabout which lasted more than 20 minutes with his son and daughter-in-law.The prince and princess posed for selfies on the other side of The Mall to the King, and chatted to people behind crash barriers with Kate telling one person she had an early start tomorrow but the occasion \u201cis a great moment for celebration\u201d.Quizzed by a BBC reporter how George, Charlotte and Louis were \u201cdoing\u201d, Kate replied: \u201cThey\u2019re really well, thank you.\u201cExcited, a bit nervous obviously with a big day ahead \u2013 can\u2019t wait actually.\u201d",
        "George will act as one of the King\u2019s Pages of Honour and is expected to help hold the long train of his grandfather\u2019s robe of estate.Questioned about how she and husband William were coping, the princess replied: \u201cAll good, hopefully a bit like swans, relatively calm on the outside and paddling on the inside.\u201dAnd when asked about the King, she said: \u201cLooking forward to it as well.\u201dThe couple posed for selfies with the royal fans, crouching down to get into the frame and at one point Kate joined a live video call with a woman\u2019s father called Peter.Waving at the person on the other end of the call, she said: \u201cHi Peter, sorry you\u2019re not here.\u201d",
        "And when handed a phone by another well-wisher, Kate took the voice call and chatted away and again said: \u201cI\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re not here.\u201dWhen one woman told William she had flown from Phoenix, Arizona, and would be camping out in The Mall overnight, he replied \u201cNo way, well done you.\u201dHe added with a smile: \u201cThere\u2019s not much sleeping going on around here, they\u2019re all sat in their chairs. I think there\u2019s a good party atmosphere.\u201dWith rain forecast for Saturday he put his hands together and said: \u201cI pray you guys stay dry.\u201d",
        "Preparations for the coronation are nearing their completion with The Mall decorated with huge union flags and others from the Commonwealth and crash barriers and other crowd control measures in place.",
        "Theresa Iredale, who turns 66 on Saturday, the day of Charles\u2019 coronation, wore a plastic crown for her encounter with Charles.She said: \u201cHe said, \u2018thank you for coming\u2019 and he appreciated it and I did say it was my birthday and he said, \u2018oh, congratulations\u2019.\u201cI was shaking. I saw his hand coming out to mine and I was like, \u2018I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m shaking the King\u2019s hand\u2019. A special moment.\u201d"
