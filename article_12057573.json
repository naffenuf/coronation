        "Nottingham Forest boss Steve Cooper is in no doubt as to how big Monday night\u2019s clash with Southampton is in his side\u2019s bid to beat the drop.",
        "Forest are currently in the bottom three and the visit of the Saints to the City Ground looks set to go a long way in deciding which division both clubs will be in next season.Victory for Forest would move them out of the relegation zone and virtually condemn their visitors to the drop, while defeat would send them nearer to an instant Championship return.Cooper says everyone at the club knows how important the game is.\u201cOf course we do,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s really important is about ignoring any situations that we\u2019ve found ourselves in throughout the season, whether it was preparing for the return to the Premier League, the initial start and going through a difficult run early on to getting a few points and managing to come out of that, injuries, the run that we went on and the last few weeks.\u201cWe\u2019ve always talked about the present, and the present situation is we\u2019re in the last month of the season with four games remaining and be open and have conversations with each other about what\u2019s needed and what\u2019s required so that we can be aware.",
        "\u201cWe don\u2019t want any surprises.\u201cWe know that Monday is really important, we knew that last Saturday and the Wednesday before that was really important. We have to use that importance as real motivation and real desire, while at the same time really focusing on what it takes to achieve what we want.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s about how we win, that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on.\u201dIf Forest do stay up it will be because of their home form, where they have taken 24 of their 30 points so far.The City Ground atmosphere has played a part in that and Cooper says each matchday has been an event.\u201cIt\u2019s an event, a real togetherness,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel it and I mean it, that you feel part of something that\u2019s bigger than a football team, and a player and a coach or whatever.\u201cYou feel really proud of what can be achieved on a matchday. It\u2019s a belonging of something big in the city and I think it drip-feeds out of the stadium as well. That\u2019s a good feeling and gives me a lot of joy.\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re so desperate to get the performances and more importantly the results because we know the effect it has on everybody connected to the football club and further than that.\u201d"
