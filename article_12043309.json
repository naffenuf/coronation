        "Lawes is staying at Northampton but wants to see change in the gameNumber of national players are leaving England for international contracts\u00a0Doubts over future of London Irish after collapse of Worcester and WaspsAs he reflected on his decision to stay at Northampton and revealed hopes of creating a legacy as a one-club man, Courtney Lawes couldn\u2019t help but survey the wreckage of the English rugby landscape around him.",
        "Lawes last week signed a one-year contract extension with the Saints, bucking the trend of England stars who have quit the Gallagher Premiership for lucrative moves abroad.Like Manu Tuilagi, Lawes is staying put but wants to see change in his country\u2019s game after a season which has seen both Worcester and Wasps fall out of existence. Worries over the future of London Irish continue, with Lawes speaking on the day their players were waiting for late wages to arrive.\u2018It's just so disappointing how we got here,\u2019 said Lawes.\u2018Five years ago we were probably the fastest growing sport in the country. We have to get some people in who understand how we're going to make this game a proper business so it continues to grow and the players are financially compensated for what they're doing to themselves.",
        "'All avenues should be explored. We need to explore everything to find out what is going to be the best solution. At the minute it feels like no one's on the same page.\u2019Lawes has played his entire club career with Northampton and turned down attractive financial offers in both France and Japan to remain a Saint.After an injury-interrupted season at both domestic and international level, the 34-year-old didn\u2019t want to end with a whimper at Saints.\u00a0",
        "Instead, he will be a key figure for Phil Dowson\u2019s side in the end-of-season Premiership play-offs before almost certainly going to the World Cup with England.Next term, he plans to hold a testimonial year with Northampton.\u2018I was pretty keen to stay because I didn\u2019t want to end on a season like I\u2019ve just had,\u2019 Lawes added.\u2018There were times when you have to think financially. But luckily Saints have always been able to respond and that\u2019s meant I\u2019ve always been able to stay a one-club man.\u2018I\u2019m delighted to be that. The main reason I stayed is that the club means a lot to me. I think they\u2019re going to need me next season. My legacy here is important to me.\u2019Lawes is entering the final stage of his career, but his legacy with Northampton is already secure. He will surely be remembered forever as one of the club\u2019s true greats.",
        "A foreign move would have ended Lawes\u2019 England career under the RFU\u2019s controversial selection ruling.He admitted he can see why many of his Test team-mates have chosen that route.Thankfully for Northampton and England, Lawes hasn\u2019t done so.\u2018I completely understand if the offers are that much better in another country then you\u2019ve got to make that work,\u2019 he added.",
        "\u2018It\u2019s a finite career and it\u2019s important you do look after yourself as when it\u2019s all over, that money is stopping. Do what is best for you is my advice for the young lads.\u2019"
