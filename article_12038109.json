        "Nurses have threatened strike action across the whole of the NHS in England after ministers imposed a new pay deal for the majority of NHS staff without an agreement with the nursing union.",
        "The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) said that it is to ballot members on further strikes between June and December \u201cacross the full NHS\u201d, previous strikes only occurred in around half of NHS trusts.It comes after Health Secretary Steve Barclay announced that more than a million NHS workers in England are to be given a 5% pay rise this year and a cash sum for last year, after the majority of NHS unions agreed to the deal.He said the deal for NHS staff on the Agenda for Change contract, which includes all NHS workers apart from doctors, dentists and senior managers, was the \u201cfinal offer\u201d as he urged the RCN and others holding out to join the majority of health unions in accepting it. It is the final offer, it\u2019s important that those unions recognise the collective decision  Health Secretary Steve Barclay  The 14 unions representing staff on the contract have balloted hundreds of thousands of members over the last few weeks.Unison, GMB, the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy and the Royal College of Midwives were among those who voted to accept the offer, while the RCN and Unite voted against it.The ballot results were reported at an NHS Staff Council meeting on Tuesday, where the majority of unions urged the Government to implement the offer.",
        "In a letter to Mr Barclay, the RCN\u2019s chief executive and general secretary Pat Cullen said: \u201cDespite today\u2019s meeting and the outcome that reflects the votes across all unions, the RCN remains in formal dispute with the Government and the NHS over pay levels.\u201cLater this month, we will ballot 280,000 members in England\u2019s NHS over further strike action to be held between June and December 2023.\u201cWe will hold an aggregated ballot under the relevant legislation which, if supported by a sufficient number of RCN members, would provide the legal mandate to take strike action across the full NHS.\u201cUntil this point, our strike action has been in approximately 50% of NHS trusts and other NHS employers.\u201dMs Cullen also told BBC News: \u201cWhat I would say to the Government today is just be careful about over claiming this as a success and an the end to the industrial action.\u201cThe Government knows only too well that nurses remain in dispute with this government, also junior doctors and a number of healthcare workers that are represented by Unite. So this dispute is far from over.\u201dShe added that ministers \u201ccan\u2019t ignore\u201d the largest group of healthcare workers in the NHS and urged them to get back round the table.\u201cLet\u2019s now get to meaningful talks, let\u2019s put more money on the table and let\u2019s make sure that these nurses don\u2019t have to be re-balloted in May and have to strike up until Christmas,\u201d she added.",
        "Unite will also continue to take action.",
        "The union\u2019s general secretary Sharon Graham said: \u201cUnite\u2019s NHS members have spoken and they rejected the deal.\u201cBecause of this, Unite used its seats on the Staff Council to also vote against it.\u201cIn fact, we will be escalating strike action.\u201cThe Staff Council vote is not binding on individual unions and therefore the vote will not stop Unite representing the best interests of our members.\u201dMr Barclay said: \u201cI\u2019m pleased the NHS Staff Council has voted to accept our pay offer, demonstrating that a majority of NHS staff agree this is a fair and reasonable deal.\u201cIt is now my intention to implement this for all staff on the Agenda for Change contract, and where some unions may choose to remain in dispute, we hope their members, many of whom voted to accept this offer, will recognise this as a fair outcome that carries the support of their colleagues and decide it is time to bring industrial action to an end.\u201dHe told reporters: \u201cIt is the final offer, it\u2019s important that those unions recognise the collective decision.\u201cIt was negotiated collectively, the RCN were at the negotiating table, indeed (RCN chief) Pat Cullen recommended this deal to her own members.\u201dSara Gorton, head of health at the union Unison, who chairs the union group on the NHS Staff Council, said: \u201cNHS workers will now want the pay rise they\u2019ve voted to accept.",
        "\u201cThe hope is that the one-off payment and salary increase will be in June\u2019s pay packets.\u201cBut health staff shouldn\u2019t have needed to take action in the first place, proper pay talks last autumn could have stopped health workers missing out on money they could ill afford to lose.\u201cThe NHS and patients would also have been spared months of disruption.\u201dMatthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said: \u201cHealth leaders are concerned that with four trade unions remaining in dispute with the Government over this deal, that the worrying prospect of further industrial action remains.\u201cAdded to that, health leaders are eager for a resolution to be agreed between the Government and British Medical Association (BMA), as the last junior doctors strikes saw 196,000 appointments and planned procedures needing to be postponed.\u201cSo, while the NHS Staff Council outcome is very positive news overall, it is not the line in the sand that will allow the NHS and those relying on its care to confidently move on from the threat of future strikes, or from the underlying issues affecting the NHS that led to this activity being felt as necessary in the first place.\u201dSir Julian Hartley, chief executive of the NHS Providers organisation, which represents NHS Trusts, said: \u201cWe hope that this brings an end to the most disruptive period of industrial action in NHS history.",
        "\u201cBut the NHS isn\u2019t out of the woods yet.\u201cIndustrial action over the past six months has led to more than 531,000 patient appointments being rescheduled, but we must remember that care backlogs stretch back long before strikes and the pandemic due to years of underfunding and many thousands of vacancies.\u201dMr Barclay met junior doctors from the BMA to discuss the row over their pay.A Government spokesperson said: \u201cThe Government and the BMA junior doctors committee held a constructive discussion this afternoon, in preparation for talks aimed at resolving the current junior doctors dispute.\u201cBoth parties will meet again in the coming days.\u201d"
