        "Jordan Spieth withdrew Monday from this week's AT&amp;amp;T Byron Nelson, citing a wrist injury.",
        "Spieth said the injury needs evaluation \"week to week,\" which could threaten his ability to play in next week's PGA Championship at Oak Hill. Spieth needs to win only the PGA Championship to complete the career Grand Slam.According to the PGA Tour, Spieth felt severe pain in his left wrist over the weekend and doctors told him the injury \"requires rest and limited movement.\"The Byron Nelson, played each year in the Dallas area, is Spieth's hometown tournament, meaning he did not take the decision to withdraw lightly.\"The AT&amp;amp;T Byron Nelson means the absolute world to me and I'm disappointed to miss it this week,\" Spieth wrote in a social media post. \"Playing in front of family &amp;amp; friends in Dallas is one of the highlights of my year, and the tournament staff and volunteers are second to none.\"I'm focused on healing as quickly as possible and will have to evaluate my recovery week to week,\" the former world No. 1 added. \"Sincere thanks to the medical professionals who have supported me over the weekend.\"Spieth is a three-time major champion, winning the 2015 Masters, the 2015 U.S. Open and the 2017 Open Championship. He has won just two tournaments since then, and none since April 2022.--Field Level Media"
