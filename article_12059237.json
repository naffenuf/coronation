        "Erik Ten Hag shrugged off the threat of Liverpool and insisted Manchester United\u2019s top-four bid is still in their own hands.",
        "Fourth-placed United have slipped to back-to-back 1-0 defeats against Brighton and West Ham to allow Liverpool, who have won six straight matches, to close to within a point of the final Champions League spot.Ten Hag\u2019s side do have a game in hand, however, and three wins from their remaining games at home to Wolves, Chelsea and Fulham and a trip to Bournemouth will guarantee finishing above Jurgen Klopp\u2019s team.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s not about Liverpool, it\u2019s about us and because of the table we have everything in our hands,\u201d said Ten Hag.\u201cIf we bring our performance and our standards we\u2019ll win games. We don\u2019t have to look to others, we have to look at ourselves and find a way to win and get back to our levels.\u201dSaid Benrahma\u2019s first-half goal, aided by an awful gaffe from United goalkeeper David De Gea, lifted West Ham seven points above the relegation zone.",
        "The Hammers spent \u00a3160million on eight new signings last summer, and another \u00a312million on Danny Ings in January, but have endured a tough season in the Premier League.However, full-back Aaron Cresswell believes the new faces are finally beginning to click.\u201cIt\u2019s always a tough transition when you bring in eight or nine players and, certainly for the boys who have come from abroad, it takes time for them to settle in,\u201d Cresswell told West Ham TV.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s a new language, a new team, a new everything.\u201cWe knew it would be tough but I think in this game, some of the performances from the new lads \u2013 Thilo Kehrer was excellent, as were Lucas Paqueta and Nayef Aguerd. All the new boys who have come in were excellent.\u201cEveryone played their part. That atmosphere was special too, especially in the last 10 minutes when you\u2019re digging deep and everyone is cramping up.\u201cBut what a night, and it\u2019s a massive three points. We\u2019re not completely safe but we\u2019re getting close to being mathematically safe.\u201d"
