Once the car was stopped, officers said they smelled marijuana, leading to a search of the vehicle.Officers recovered a 9-millimeter handgun and an unspecified quantity of marijuana, the Times reported.The boxer appeared to reference the arrest later on Twitter, writing \"I\u00b4d rather be safe than sorry. The End,\" followed by the prayer hands emoji.The former World Boxing Council heavyweight champion was held in lieu of $35,000 bail and released at 6:35 a.m. Charges were pending.",
