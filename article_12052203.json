        "The club were placed under the embargo by the EFL in March, blaming the late submission of their accounts on a change of auditor.The situation has now been resolved, meaning the Clarets will be free to strengthen their squad this summer ahead of their return to the Premier League when the transfer window reopens.A statement on the club website read: 'We are happy to share with you that, at the end of April, Burnley Football Club filed the necessary audited accounts with Company House and also sent copies to the EFL.'This means the club's temporary transfer embargo has now been lifted with immediate effect and we can continue to move forward.",
        "'The delay was solely to make necessary changes to the way we do our accounting, which has now placed Burnley Football Club on even stronger and steadier financial footings.'We look forward to celebrating our Championship title with you all on Monday at the final match of the season at Turf Moor and hope you can join us on the streets of Burnley on Tuesday for The Champions' Parade.'Manager Vincent Kompany welcomed the news, saying on lancs.live: 'I think it's just confirmed what we said a few months ago.'It was an administrative error and I think the club took responsibility for it. But there was a very simple way to explain as well why it happened and now business as usual.'"
