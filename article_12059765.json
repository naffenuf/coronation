        "Carlisle boss Paul Simpson is relishing a play-off showdown with Bradford after his side\u2019s 1-1 draw at Sutton secured them fifth place in League Two.",
        "The Cumbrians have limped into the top seven with just two wins from their final 11 games.Kylian Kouassi\u2019s first-half effort was cancelled out by Joe Kizzi\u2019s late own goal at Gander Green Lane.But Simpson\u2019s side are now fully focused on playing Mark Hughes\u2019 Bantams on Sunday before hosting them the following weekend.He said: \u201cI\u2019m absolutely delighted to get into the play-offs. Thankfully we got the point that sealed it and confirmed the play-offs.\u201cIt kept us in fifth position and, wow, what two incredible games to look forward to.",
        "\u201cWe\u2019ve got Bradford City at their place and I\u2019ve heard they\u2019ve sold out 22,500 home tickets and I expect them to do that next week and I expect us to sell out for our support for that game.\u201cAnd then what a game to look forward to at Brunton Park the following weekend.\u201cWe know we need to be better but it\u2019s an incredible achievement from this group to be in the play-offs from where we started last season.\u201cIt\u2019s a brilliant achievement and we have to go and make sure we finish it properly.\u201cI\u2019m not sure if playing the second leg at home makes a massive difference if I\u2019m perfectly honest.\u201cI\u2019m delighted we\u2019re at home for the second leg, that\u2019s a big thing for us. We\u2019ve just got to make sure we make it count.",
        "\u201cWe have to make sure we\u2019re still in the tie after the first leg at Valley Parade. Second game you\u2019ve got to go and finish it off.\u201cI expect Mark Hughes and Bradford City to be saying the same thing.\u201dMatt Gray\u2019s U\u2019s stopped the rot after six straight defeats with a final-day point.He said: \u201cIt\u2019s so disappointing to concede at the end with a ball that\u2019s taken a deflection off our defender and gone into the bottom corner.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to take but overall it was a good performance and a decent result to send us off after another fantastic season.\u201cWe\u2019ve been superb this season, to get through as many injuries as we did with the small squad we have here is probably the best spell I\u2019ve had as a manager.\u201cWe knew we needed to take advantage of the breeze and the slope here in the first half and we did.\u201cIt was a typical Sutton performance, winning the ball high up, turning the ball over and getting on the counter attack.\u201cI knew second half would be different and we\u2019d need to be disciplined and resolute. Our goalkeeper only had one real save to make.\u201cIt\u2019s a tight division. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a big gap between the top and the bottom teams, it\u2019s just the consistency of putting results together.",
        "\u201cThey\u2019re a good side and I wish them well in the play-offs.\u201d"
