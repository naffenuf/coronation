        "She also noted the Conservative Party had been in power for \u201ca long time\u201d.The Cabinet minister conceded that voters were \u201cfrustrated and angry\u201d, but claimed Rishi Sunak was starting to regain the public\u2019s trust.The Prime Minister has been blamed by some Tories after the party shed 960 councillors in Thursday\u2019s poll.",
        "Ms Frazer told Sky News\u2019 Sophy Ridge On Sunday programme: \u201cIf we could look at the context for the whole local election, we\u2019ve been in power for a long time.\u201cWe\u2019ve just had a pandemic which has disrupted many people\u2019s lives and has had consequences for the economy, as has the war in Ukraine, which is going on.\u201dPressed on whether she understood the scale of her party\u2019s losses, she said: \u201cTotally, it\u2019s really important that we listen to people. I know people are frustrated and angry.\u201dShe said she recognised the results were \u201cnot good\u201d, adding: \u201cI totally understand that we need to do better and I think we are going to deliver.\u201dThe party was rebuilding trust as Mr Sunak was \u201cstarting to deliver in a quiet way\u201d his five priorities including curbing inflation, Ms Frazer argued.\u201cI totally recognise we\u2019ve had a really difficult few years. I do think that the Prime Minister, who\u2019s now been in office for six months, is getting the country back on track and is delivering  Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer  ",
        "\u201cI do think that the Prime Minister, who\u2019s now been in office for six months, is getting the country back on track and is delivering. I think we\u2019re starting to gain the trust of the British public.\u201dPressed on whether the Tories needed to offer more than Mr Sunak\u2019s promises from January, she told the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg On Sunday programme: \u201cWe absolutely need to reflect. I think Rishi\u2019s only been the Prime Minister for six months.\u201dKuenssberg said: \u201cIt\u2019s not five minutes, it\u2019s six months.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not five minutes but these are huge challenges,\u201d Ms Frazer replied.Some Tories blamed the electoral hammering on the lack of tax cuts.",
        "Former minister Sir John Redwood tweeted: \u201cLast Thursday many Conservative voters went on strike. They do not want to vote for higher taxes, anti enterprise policies and a failure to take back control of our borders.\u201dMs Frazer insisted the Government was doing those things, saying: \u201cThe biggest tax cut we can make is a cut in inflation\u201d.Tory MP Anthony Browne denied that Mr Sunak was \u201cunder threat in any way\u201d after the dire results.\u201cI think a lot of it was a protest vote,\u201d the South Cambridgeshire MP told the BBC\u2019s Westminster Hour, noting the pandemic and \u201call the shenanigans of last year, which, for people, this was their first chance to actually vote against that\u201d.",
        "\u201cRishi has calmed things down a lot.\u201dHe also claimed that \u201cLabour has not got the momentum it needs to win a general election\u201d.Meanwhile, Labour was celebrating \u201cpretty encouraging\u201d local election results, which saw Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s party gain 635 seats and take control of another 22 local authorities.Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting told Ridge: \u201cI think for the next general election Labour feels confident but not complacent.\u201d"
