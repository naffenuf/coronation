        "The Arizona Diamondbacks are set to promote top pitching prospect Brandon Pfaadt to the major leagues, the Arizona Republic reported Tuesday, and the right-hander will make his major league debut Wednesday against the Texas Rangers.",
        "Pfaadt, 24, was a fifth-round draft pick in 2020 out of Bellarmine and has gone 21-15 with a 3.58 ERA in 56 minor league starts over the past three seasons. He is 2-1 with a 3.91 ERA In five starts at Triple-A Reno this season.Because Pfaadt is not on the 40-man roster, the Diamondbacks will need to make a corresponding move in order to make the roster addition.Arizona was 11-7 three weeks into the season and in first place in the National League West. But the club has gone 5-6 since, while cutting ties with veteran starter Madison Bumgarner last week.--Field Level Media"
