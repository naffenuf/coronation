        "Rishi Sunak has insisted he will push on with his agenda despite the Tories suffering major losses in his first electoral test as Prime Minister.",
        "With the reporting of local election results under way on Friday, Labour claimed its victories so far suggest Sir Keir Starmer will be able enter in No 10 after a general election.The Liberal Democrats also made gains as the Tories lost control of a series of councils across England.",
        "Labour took Medway off the Tories and will run the Kent council for the first time since 1998, with the outgoing council leader telling No 10 to \u201cget their act together\u201d on multiple fronts.Government minister and local MP Johnny Mercer said Labour gaining control of Plymouth, where the Tories had run a minority administration, was \u201cterrible\u201d, before the opposition seized another battleground with Stoke-on-Trent.In Hertsmere, where Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden is MP, the Tories lost control of the council, with 13 councillors voted out while Labour gained seven and the Lib Dems six.Tamworth, Brentwood, North West Leicestershire and East Lindsey fell from Tory administrations to no overall control.Mr Sunak insisted it was \u201chard to draw firm conclusions\u201d from the initial results after speaking to staff at Conservative Campaign Headquarters in central London on Friday morning.",
        "He told broadcasters he was \u201cnot detecting any massive groundswell of movement towards the Labour Party or excitement for its agenda\u201d despite the Opposition gains.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s always disappointing to lose hardworking Conservative councillors, they\u2019re friends, they\u2019re colleagues, and I\u2019m so grateful to them for everything they\u2019ve done,\u201d he added.\u201cBut in terms of the results, it\u2019s still early. We\u2019ve just had a quarter of the results in but what I am going to carry on doing is delivering on the people\u2019s priorities.\u201dHe cited his priorities as halving inflation, growing the economy, reducing debt, cutting NHS waiting lists and \u201cstopping the boats\u201d, adding: \u201cThat\u2019s what people want us to do, that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to keep hard at doing.\u201dThe Prime Minister also claimed the Tories were \u201cmaking progress in key electoral battlegrounds like Peterborough, Bassetlaw, Sandwell\u201d.The inroads for the Tories were debatable. In Sandwell, they gained two of 24 seats, while Labour gained four and held 18 more.Elsewhere, the Conservatives lost control of South Kesteven in Lincolnshire, where the party had 36 of the 56 seats before polling day.West Lindsey remained under no overall control but the Lib Dems replaced the Tories as the largest party.",
        "In Boston, the Tories lost 10 councillors in the Lincolnshire town they had run as a minority, with independents now taking the majority of seats.Labour replaced the Tories as the largest party in Hartlepool and Worcester.",
        "On the eve of the coronation, the Tories lost control in the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead, with the Lib Dems claiming victory.A Lib Dem spokesman said it is a \u201cmassive blow to Rishi Sunak\u201d and \u201cConservative MPs across the blue wall will be looking over their shoulder at the Lib Dems this morning\u201d.",
        "Tories lose nine councils with net loss of 190 councillorsLabour gains control of three councils and puts on 138 councillorsLiberal Democrats gain one council and 59 councillorsThe Green Party gains 13 councillors",
        "Tory insiders said they had always expected a \u201ctough night for the party\u201d, but with the prospect of a general election in 2024 there will be concerns that they have suffered losses in the North, South and Midlands.Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris said the party had experienced a \u201cbit of a blip\u201d after the turmoil in No 10 which saw Boris Johnson and Liz Truss ousted before Mr Sunak took office.He attempted to present the losses as mid-term blues for the Tories, telling Sky News: \u201cThe British people are a very sensible group of folk and they understand what\u2019s important.\u201cOccasionally they like to give political parties a bit of a reminder of who the politicians serve. Certainly when you get into being mid-term in a government you get quite a bit of that.\u201d",
        "Veterans minister Mr Mercer told the BBC the Plymouth result was due to local factors and insisted the Prime Minister was \u201cthe sort of strong leader this country needs at this time\u201d.The council\u2019s decision to fell dozens of trees in the city centre contributed to the loss of Tory support.Mr Mercer said: \u201cI think, locally, it has been very difficult. The Conservative group here has been through a very difficult time. We have seen that reflected on the doors, in the campaign and we have seen that reflected in the results tonight but, you know, we take it on the chin.\u201dStoke-on-Trent North\u2019s Tory MP Jonathan Gullis told Sky News that councillors had \u201csuffered because, at the end of 2022, the Conservative Party as a brand was certainly damaged\u201d.In Tamworth \u2013 the seat of scandal-hit former Tory whip Chris Pincher \u2013 Labour made seven gains, pushing it from Conservative into no overall control.But Labour\u2019s attempts to regain Hull from the Lib Dems failed, with Sir Ed Davey\u2019s party tightening its grip on the authority.Conservative councillor Alan Jarrett, who will no longer lead Medway after Labour seized control, said Downing Street must \u201cget their act together on a number of fronts\u201d.He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme the party leaders must \u201cget a grip of the economy\u201d, be clearer about housing targets and improve access to GPs.",
        "With full results from 61 of the 230 councils where elections were being held:\u2013 The Tories have lost nine councils and suffered a net loss of 190 councillors.\u2013 Labour has gained control of three councils and added 138 councillors.\u2013 The Liberal Democrats have gained one council and 59 councillors.\u2013 The Green Party has gained 13 councillors.Sir Keir\u2019s party expects to have its best local election results since 1997, with an equivalent vote share lead of at least 8% over the Tories, which could result in a majority Labour government if repeated at a Westminster contest.Shabana Mahmood, Labour\u2019s national campaign co-ordinator, said: \u201cThese results have been a disaster for Rishi Sunak as voters punish him for the Tories\u2019 failure.\u201dLabour claimed that, based on the aggregate vote, the party would have won the Westminster constituencies of Hartlepool, Stevenage, Dudley South, Ipswich, West Bromwich East, Great Grimsby and Aldershot, which has been held by the Tories since its creation as a seat in 1918.Labour\u2019s Chris Cooke won the battle to become mayor of Middlesbrough, defeating the independent incumbent Andy Preston with a swing of almost 20%.",
        "Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed said it had been a \u201cgroundbreaking night\u201d for his party.He said: \u201cWe are exceeding all expectations. We have delivered a hammer blow to the Conservative Party in the blue wall ahead of next year\u2019s general election.\u201d",
        "But the elections were branded a \u201cdark day for British democracy\u201d by campaigners opposed to the introduction of photo ID, who claimed thousands of people had been denied their right to vote.The contests were the first to be fought under new rules requiring voters to carry photographic ID, and the elections watchdog said some people were turned away from polling stations.An Electoral Commission spokesman said: \u201cWe already know from our research that the ID requirement posed a greater challenge for some groups in society, and that some people were regrettably unable to vote today as a result.\u201cIt will be essential to understand the extent of this impact, and the reasons behind it, before a final view can be taken on how the policy has worked in practice and what can be learned for future elections.\u201dTom Brake of Unlock Democracy, who is leading a coalition of groups opposed to the policy including the Electoral Reform Society, Fair Vote UK and Open Britain, said: \u201cToday has been a dark day for British democracy.\u201cReports from all over the country confirm our very worst fears of the impact of the disastrous policy which has been made worse by the shambolic way it has been introduced.\u201dAssociation of Electoral Administrators chief executive Peter Stanyon said there had been \u201cmany anecdotal reports\u201d of people being unable to vote but \u201cit is still too early to gauge how introducing voter ID has gone\u201d."
