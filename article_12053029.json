        "How are YOU celebrating the Coronation? Send your pictures and videos to pictures@mailonline.co.uk\u00a0This morning my friends and I will be excitedly gathered around my wide-screen, high-definition TV to catch every detail of the Coronation in all its splendour.Union Jacks will flutter at my windows, there will be Dubonnet and gins at the ready, quiches in the oven, a table laden with cocktail sausages, pork pies and, yes, even cucumber sandwiches.It is not every day you can celebrate the Coronation of your King, particularly one who served our late Queen so dutifully all his life and now, aged 74, assumes the mantle of Sovereign.Yet at the back of my mind I do have a concern \u2014 and it is a substantial one. I am uneasy that Camilla will be crowned Queen beside him.After all, the Queen never made her beloved husband Prince Philip our King. And while it\u2019s true she was clear Camilla should be formally made Queen Consort \u2014 a generous gesture given Her Majesty once referred to her as \u2018that wicked woman\u2019 \u2014 Charles has gone one step further and declared her Queen.",
        "To be fair, Camilla never asked for this honour. But more importantly, nor did the British public.Like millions of loyal monarchists, I wish King Charles and Queen Camilla well. But why did he have to over-reach with Camilla when so many of us still have misgivings about her? A poll in the Mail this week mirrored my own concerns \u2014 naming the late Queen our most popular royal, Prince William in second place followed by his mother Princess Diana who died nearly three decades ago.Most telling was that Queen Camilla was near the bottom, along with Meghan, Harry and Andrew.However much Charles loves Camilla, his subjects do not share his adoration. And I\u2019m afraid to say much of this has to do with Diana who, even in death, casts a shadow over today\u2019s proceedings. It\u2019s made more poignant by the fact that she feared the woman who got her husband would get to wear the crown. Today that comes to pass.Women of my generation lived through Charles\u2019s betrayal and we can\u2019t shake off memories of Camilla\u2019s role in that desperately sad saga.That\u2019s why as I watch today, I will feel uncomfortable when Camilla is made Queen \u2014 and hope it will not turn out to be a terrible mistake.Singer Taylor Swift is madly in love with little-known Brit rocker and ex heroin addict Matt Healy who smokes joints in interviews. This echoes supermodel Kate Moss\u2019s disastrous relationship with ex addict rocker Pete Doherty.So a gentle reminder to multi-millionairess Taylor, opposites may attract but they can also often end in tears.Sheer cheek, Kendall!Accepted wisdom among fashionistas at New York\u2019s Met Gala after-party is that less is more, if you want to grab attention among so many beautiful women. Kendall Jenner proved the point with her cheeky sense of humour. Was she channelling her inner Borat in that eye-watering thong over sheer shorts?\u00a0",
        "Kate and William prove a pint to HarryAs Harry prepared to fly to London for his one-day Coronation jaunt, William and Kate pulled pints in Soho pub the Dog And Duck and got the Tube home. Let\u2019s hope the Spare spared a thought for his eco-warrior reputation as he clocked up the air miles for a few begrudged hours with Papa.How touching that William will make a moving tribute to both his father and stepmother after tomorrow\u2019s concert. And it\u2019s one in the eye for Harry, whose venom towards Camilla was unmasked in his book and who\u2019ll be safely back in California trying not to choke on his kale smoothie as he sees how popular his estranged brother is.What a woke ninny our Archbishop of Canterbury is, inviting us all to pledge allegiance to the King \u2014 at home in front of the telly! That\u2019s unlikely as, after a few drinks having watched the Coronation from 10 am, some of us will have trouble even standing.The Old Vic theatre warns its play Pygmalion has scenes of \u2018coercive control\u2019 as Eliza Doolittle, with her terrible accent, becomes sophisticated. Blimey, I wish someone had exerted coercive control over me. Maybe I\u2019d have lost my own awful accent.\u00a0Westminster wars\u00a0Now we learn that \u2018impeccably impartial\u2019 civil servant Sue Gray had \u2018multiple talks\u2019 for at least four months with Keir Starmer to become his chief of staff, while she was investigating Boris Johnson over Partygate. The result of the Privileges Committee investigation into Partygate \u2014 which could decide Boris\u2019s future \u2014 is due in May. It should be cancelled immediately as this Labour stitch-up stinks. The only investigation we need now is into Gray\u2019s links with Labour.Labour should contain their jubilation over local election wins. William Hague won a huge number of seats in the locals before the 2001 general election \u2014 when the Tories were trounced by a second Blair landslide.No wonder Generation Z refuses to understand phrases used by older folk. \u2018Flogging a dead horse\u2019 is animal cruelty. \u2018Back to the salt mines\u2019 has echoes of slavery. \u2018Burn the midnight oil\u2019 means working more than four hours a day. \u2018Bite the bullet\u2019 is surely warmongering. And how offensive is \u2018What\u2019s the beef?\u2019 \u2014 to vegans, not to mention fruitarians?\u00a0",
        "Heard done by\u00a0After her very public divorce from Johnny Depp, Amber Heard has quietly moved to Madrid. Meanwhile Depp is making his movie comeback in Jeanne du Barry which is premiering at the Cannes Film Festival.Both came across as thoroughly awful people during their court proceedings, yet why is it that bad publicity recharges Johnny\u2019s career \u2014 while Amber is left jobless and unheard?Announcing the opening of a new chain of restaurants, Jamie Oliver reveals he was so cocky as a child \u2014 working from the age of 11 in the pub his dad owned \u2014 that he used to be locked in the freezer to cool down. These days that would be called child abuse, yet he\u2019s now one of our most successful and most loved chefs.A message to snowflakes that it\u2019s hard work, determination and not whining about \u2018issues\u2019 that gets you a seat at the top table.Jodie screens her private life\u00a0Jodie Comer is up for a Tony Award for her one-woman play Prima Facie.She is very privately dating American lacrosse player James Burke and, as of last year, lived with her parents in Liverpool. No social media to take note of, no selfies of the Killing Eve star.Just proves to all those celebs screaming invasion of privacy, if you want a private life, you can have it.Despite pouring sewage into our rivers and seas, water companies were fined only \u00a310.5 million while rewarding bosses with bonuses totalling \u00a330 million. When will the Government realise we treasure our waterways and would like to be able to swim in them untroubled by filth and the stench of fat-cat greed?"
