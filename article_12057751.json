        "The Tollemache family is devastated by the tragic loss of our beloved son and brother, Warwick.Warwick was a playful, cheeky, good-humoured, and extremely kind-hearted person, who always had a radiant smile. He had an incredible gift for spreading kindness, love, and compassion wherever he went, and he touched the lives of countless people with his generosity and deep empathy.\u00a0His father, John, describes him as the kindest, gentlest, most loving person who got his joy out of other people's happiness; that he spent his life making other people happy. Warwick was a beacon of love; he was literally love personified.John remembers the many times when his sons, Dylan and Warwick, had a rule that whoever called 'shotgun' first, would get to sit in the front seat of the car. Despite often being the first to call it, Warwick would let Dylan sit there instead, finding more joy in his brother's happiness than he found in sitting in the front himself.",
        "'You're one of the good guys of this world, Woz', is what his father, John Tollemache, often told him.Warwick is his mother, Mandy's, pride and joy. One message that she will always cherish was Warwick's heartfelt expression of gratitude: 'I've grown into a man who knows he always has been and always will be loved unconditionally by his mom\u2026 and the world isn't a scary place anymore\u2026 coz you got me\u2026 We got this'.Warwick was a natural leader who inspired everyone around him to be their best selves, which was one of the reasons he was made captain of his school's first fifteen rugby team.\u00a0One of his friends recently summarised this well, stating: 'You were a leader to us all, my friend. You were braver, you knew so much when we were all just kids figuring out who we were...\u00a0'You guided us through being teenagers, and I will miss you for the rest of my life. Thank you for being such a beautiful person; your light was cut short, and we needed more like you in this world...' Warwick was a reliable friend who you could always count on to lift you up and help you through your toughest times.Warwick's impact on those around him cannot be overstated, and nowhere was this impact more evident than in his unbreakable bond with his brother, his 'brozzie dog', Dylan. They were more than just brothers; they were best friends who shared the deepest bond that two brothers could ever share.\u00a0They were always there for each other, through all of life's ups and downs, and their unwavering love and support for one another knew no bounds. Whether it was hitting the gym together, going out fishing, or playing World of Warcraft late into the night, Warwick and Dylan loved spending time together and never took their bond for granted. Warwick's love and strength will live on in Dylan's heart forever, and their bond will never be broken.He had a talent for making people laugh and was always quick with a joke or a kind word. Warwick also loved writing and drawing, writing in his journal every day, writing stories, and letters. He had a gift with words, and when Warwick spoke, everyone listened and were very often brought to tears with his beautiful and profound way with words and view of the world.",
        "Warwick was also brilliant, earning two university degrees - first in Business and then in Exercise Science. He received multiple prestigious awards for academic excellence during his second degree.\u00a0He had ambitions to become a physiotherapist or a doctor and was studying hard for the GAMSAT when his life took a devastating turn, developing severe, chronic, and debilitating migraines that affected him daily.Warwick sought help from both public and private healthcare systems but was repeatedly turned away and refused treatment or dignity. This lack of care led to self-medication with alcohol at times and eventually to mental illness.On countless occasions, Warwick was made to wait for 12+ hours in the waiting room of the Princess Alexandra Hospital, only to never be seen by a doctor. The rare times he was seen by a doctor, despite Warwick and his family begging for help, he was turned away.\u00a0Warwick, who found joy and purpose in helping others, was treated with a complete lack of humanity, respect, care, and compassion. This culture of neglect and disregard for patients' dignity within Metro South Health is dehumanising, and it is shameful that Warwick was a victim of such systemic failure.Despite the challenges he faced, Warwick remained incredibly positive, strong, and brave throughout his recovery, including always making himself available to anyone in need.\u00a0His family did everything they could to support him and spent countless days and months trying to provide an inpatient level of care at home, which should have been provided by the public and private hospitals that failed him. The family is seeking answers from Metro South Health.One of the fondest memories that Warwick and his sister Sarah share together is one of the days they spent doing random acts of kindness; one of Warwick's favourite pastimes.\u00a0They bought flowers for strangers, paid for groceries for others, and spent the day giving compliments and generous tips to strangers.

The Tollemache family is working to ensure that his legacy continues, and his friends and community are already supporting this effort."
