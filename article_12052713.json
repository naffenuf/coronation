        "After postponing their wedding twice, a West Midlands couple are now sharing their special day with the King\u2019s coronation following a seven-year-long engagement.",
        "Groom Bryan Russell, 57, and bride Wendy McEnery, 56, have been forced to cancel their wedding on two occasions due to the Covid-19 pandemic and Mr Russell losing his job.The Halesowen couple had set the date for their big day for the third time when the date of the coronation for the King was announced.Mr Russell said that upon learning the date of the coronation: \u201cMy words were, \u2018He can move his coronation before I move our wedding day\u2019.\u201d",
        "Mr Russell said it would be a \u201cshame\u201d that the couple will not be able to watch the historic event as \u201cwe are royalists at the end of the day\u201d.He added: \u201cWe watched the Jubilee celebrations. We watched the Queen\u2019s funeral. We\u2019ve watched the royal weddings, but I\u2019m not cancelling the third time.\u201dHe said some guests may watch the coronation on television during the day, and the wedding venue has hung Union Jack bunting to celebrate the coronation \u2013 but the royal event \u201cwill be at the back of our minds\u201d.Both the bride and groom have been married before and wanted to celebrate their union at Haden Hill House with a \u201cvery relaxed wedding\u201d.Mr Russell said: \u201cIt\u2019s about meeting families, two families coming together and then friends on the night.\u201d",
        "The couple met on an internet dating site, with Mr Russell saying: \u201cWe\u2019d been chatting for several months and we decided to meet.\u201dThe groom said Ms McEnery \u201cnever thought I was going to ask her to marry because I said I\u2019ll never get married again, so it was a shock to everybody\u201d.He ultimately decided to pop the question because she is the \u201cright one for me\u201d.On the eve of the wedding, Mr Russell said that his significant other was \u201cpanicking\u201d while he was feeling \u201crelaxed\u201d about the day.\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to it,\u201d he said."
