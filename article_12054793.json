        "Motherwell manager Stuart Kettlewell revealed he has set his team the target of finishing seventh this season following their 2-0 home win over Kilmarnock.",
        "Goals from Blair Spittal and Kevin van Veen \u2013 the Dutchman\u2019s 25th of the campaign \u2013 ensured the Fir Park side are all but safe from relegation with four games remaining.Kettlewell, though, insisted his focus has always been looking up the table rather than down the way, and wants Motherwell to aim to overhaul Livingston in seventh spot.He said: \u201cIt\u2019s another good home win with a clean sheet for us.\u201cWe would maybe have liked that second goal to have come a wee bit earlier to calm the nerves. But it\u2019s testament to the players who dealt with everything that came their way.\u201cTheir goalkeeper has had an outstanding day with some massive stops. Paul McGinn misses one from two yards that might haunt him, but we created a number of chances and deserved the win.",
        "\u201cAt no point have we been looking at what\u2019s happening behind us. It\u2019s a case of what we can affect. We have to go every week and approach it the way we did today. If we do, we have a chance to be a successful club.\u201cWhat\u2019s the best we can achieve? To finish top of the bottom six. We\u2019d love to take that position but we only do that by doing our work through the week.\u201d",
        "Kettlewell insisted there would be no prospect of his players now easing through to the summer break.He said: \u201cWe are functioning really well as a team. It seems a long way from when I first took over but these guys are knocking down barriers.\u201cThey are speaking about having Monday off but it\u2019s not going to happen. We have four games to go and we need to give the utmost respect to what our goals are and reach them.\u201dKilmarnock boss Derek McInnes was left frustrated with his team\u2019s performance, especially on the back of their victory at St Mirren last time out.He said: \u201cIt was very disappointing. We need better performances than that at this stage of the season.\u201cThis was always going to be the toughest of the five games, taking in mind our away form. We took confidence from beating St Mirren but we never got to those levels.\u201cMotherwell have a maverick player in Van Veen and he inspires them. We missed Kyle Vassell but we still had enough as a team to get something from the game. If you can\u2019t win, then make sure you don\u2019t lose it.\u201cThe second goal was disappointing. Van Veen\u2019s technique was good but we should defend that better.\u201d"
