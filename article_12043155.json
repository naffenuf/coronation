        "Nope, I\u2019m in\u00a0head-to-toe pink.Greta Gerwig\u2019s Barbie movie is coming and that means one thing is for certain: the trend for fuchsia is here and I couldn\u2019t be happier.Even staunch minimalists like me want a little colour in our lives, and this lurid pink is one I\u2019ve got used to. There\u2019s comfort in familiarity.",
        "NOT SO BIMBOYes, yes, pink traditionally has connotations of a certain \u2018bimbo\u2019 aesthetic, but get with it, people: Legally Blonde was released in 2001. In 2023, we\u2019re all wearing it.\u00a0It\u00a0has become the definitive celebratory hue: a bold, bright, feminist statement.\u00a0If you think it\u2019s too loud,\u00a0too look-at-me, then get over it - you\u2019re not going to be the centre of attention this Saturday, with Charles in a robe that\u2019s made of actual gold thread.HAUTE TO HIGH STREETNow if money were no object, I\u2019d treat myself to Valentino\u2019s crepe floral-applique wool-blend dress from their fuchsia-toned runway show, but it\u2019s \u00a38,400.\u00a0And money is very much an object. Instead, I\u2019ll turn to the High Street.\u00a0This vivid pink textured silk-linen dress from Jigsaw is a real find. It\u2019s comfortable for relaxed daywear and the bias cut means it doesn\u2019t cling.\u00a0If you want something more fun, take a look at Kitri\u2019s feathered design below \u2014 perfect for your Coronation after-party.MAKE IT HOTWhatever you choose, make sure it\u2019s in a rich, vibrant hue. To nail the trend, you want a properly saturated pink (this is also one of the easiest tricks to making a garment look expensive).\u00a0",
