        "Everton boss Sean Dyche insisted his side never doubted themselves after a thumping 5-1 Premier League victory over Brighton lifted the Toffees two points clear of the relegation zone.",
        "It was Everton\u2019s first away league win in 14 attempts and could not have come at a more opportune time, with just three matches now remaining to secure their top-flight safety.Abdoulaye Doucoure\u2019s strike after 34 seconds laid down what retrospectively ultimately felt like an emphatic opening statement as both he and Dwight McNeil went on to scores braces on either side of the half.",
        "Dyche said: \u201cPeople will be out there thinking right, OK, there\u2019s life in that team but we\u2019ve never lost sight of that.\u201cIt just reminds the players that their work ethic, their commitment to the cause, their commitment to the group is really important because I know there\u2019s quality.\u201cI\u2019ve always believed there\u2019s quality. I\u2019ve said it many times, but talking about it doesn\u2019t win you a game. It\u2019s the collective mentality to go and deliver everything you\u2019ve got.\u201cWe were very frustrated not to come away with all three points (against Leicester) but we got a reward for carrying on that mentality in their performances tonight.\u201dDoucoure netted his second when he volleyed the ball home after 29 minutes before McNeil\u2019s cross further buried Brighton, with it deflecting off Jordan Steele, who had stooped to save but instead felt the ball bounce off the back of his leg and in.",
        "Alexis Mac Allister clawed one back before McNeil\u2019s first but the Brighton burial was not complete until McNeil\u00a0fired home the visitors\u2019 fifth in the embers of second-half stoppage-time.Victory meant Dyche\u2019s side are safe for the time being, with league leaders Manchester City up next followed by encounters with Wolves and Bournemouth.\u201cThey\u2019re very high feeling the feel-good factor,\u201d he added. \u201cBut it\u2019s only another step. I said that after Arsenal, and sometimes people forget that. There\u2019s three more big steps we\u2019ve got to take.\u201dBrighton head coach Roberto De Zerbi, meanwhile, suggested his side\u2019s performance revealed they were not yet ready to go toe-to-toe with the best in the business, though he was unspecific about whether he was looking at England\u2019s top four or more broadly to the other side of the Channel.",
        "It could still be possible for Brighton to secure European football with a seventh-place finish, but De Zerbi\u2019s men would feel more satisfied with a higher position.He said: \u201cOf course we can lose the game. We can lose against Everton, but I\u2019m disappointed for the first half because it was tough.\u201cWe showed we are not ready yet to compete and to achieve the big target. If we want to improve, if we want to fix our target higher, we have to improve very fast  Roberto De Zerbi  ",
        "\u201cBut I am speaking about mentality, not other things, not other parts of football.\u201cIt\u2019s not easy because playing in the last period, three games in a week is difficult if you are not used to playing so many games.\u201cBut if we want to improve, if we want to fix our target higher, we have to improve very fast.\u201d"
