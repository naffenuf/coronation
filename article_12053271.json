        "'I don't think I intimidate.

Before Taste the Nation, I could count on one hand the times I had to interview people, and those were at a literary festival or a food festival \u2014 it wasn't for anything very high stakes.\u00a0'It was something I had to learn on set, and I'm still learning,' Lakshmi explained.",
        "'I think the reason I learned [how to become an interviewer] so quickly is that I'm genuinely interested,' Lakshmi confided.'The whole show is created around all of my various interests: history, food, people, languages, traveling. I'm genuinely curious.'",
        "Lakshmi said she tried to approach every community with fresh eyes.She wants to go into a community, learn about their food, have your questions answered, and then repeat."
