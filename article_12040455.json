        "Yellowstone Ending After Season 5? Reports Swirl that Costner Will Only Film for ONE WEEKThe first reports of drama on Yellowstone came in early February, when Deadline\u00a0reported that Yellowstone creator Taylor Sheridan and Paramount were plotting the end of the show.The report claimed Sheridan and Paramount were in talks for a new spin-off starring Matthew McConaughey, and that Costner and Sheridan were at odds over his shooting schedule on the back half of Yellowstone Season 5.\u00a0While Costner originally committed to filming 65 days for Season 5, he only wanted to shoot 50 days for the first half of the season, which wrapped up with the mid-season finale that aired January 1.He then reportedly only wanted to film for one week for the second half of the season, since he's currently directing and starring in his Western epic Horizon for Warner Bros., his first directorial gig in 20 years.Paramount reportedly turned down Costner's proposal and was reportedly moving forward with the McConaughey spin-off in its stead.\u00a0",
        "Kevin's Lawyer Denies The ReportCostner's high-powered attorney Marty Singer told Puck News just days after the original report that it was, 'an absolute lie.''The idea that Kevin was only willing to work one week on the second half of season 5 of Yellowstone is an absolute lie,' he said.\u00a0'It's ridiculous \u2014 and anyone suggesting it shouldn't be believed for one second,' Singer added.'As everyone who knows anything about Kevin is well aware, he is incredibly passionate about the show and has always gone way above and beyond to ensure its success.'A Paramount representative also referred to Costner as an integral part of the show's success when speaking with the outlet.\u00a0'As we previously stated, Kevin has been a key component of the success of our Yellowstone series, and we hope that continues from here on out,' they said.That report also revealed the final episodes of Season 5 had not been shot yet, and the network hoped to start filming this summer for a November debut on Paramount Network.",
        "Kevin's Co-Stars Deny Any Trouble on the Set with CostnerYellowstone star Wes Bentley put in an appearance at the\u00a0SCAD TV Fest in late February, where he brushed off the reports about Costner.'I know that they're still working on\u2026 working things out with everyone, to make sure we shoot,' Bentley said.'And I'm confident we will,' he asserted. 'We always have before. I think it's probably a bit of drama over nothing.'\u00a0Piper Perabo and Lainey Wilson also chimed in on the supposed drama at the Billboard Music Awards in March.' I mean, there's always a lot of drama when it comes to Yellowstone, don't believe everything you hear,' Perabo, who plays environmental activist Summer Higgins, told Entertainment Tonight.Taylor Sheridan knows to play it really close to the vest, and I know better than to speak outside the ranch, but I'm excited to see what happens next,' Perabo, who is married to Yellowstone director Stephen Kay, added.And Wilson, who plays musician Abby on the show, said, 'You know what, I don't know much, but I have a feeling they're going to end it the right way, and there's gonna be more of it,' Wilson said. 'And I'm hoping I'm gonna be back in it!'",
        "Rumors Claim Yellowstone is Ending After Season 5 Due to Disputes Between Costner and Taylor Sheridan\u00a0Another report from The New York Post\u00a0in mid-April claimed that the show was coming to an end after Season 5 due to Costner and Sheridan clashing.'It's the same as with any show runner and big star \u2014 there's respect, but there's friction,' a source described as 'well-placed' within the production said.Another 'highly placed Hollywood' source suggested that some of the blame for the 'friction' on set lies with its creator.\u00a0'Taylor is the star of his show. He's the most important person on all of his shows,' they said.However, the production source said: 'We're hoping it will be worked out. It's too big a show for things not to be worked out.'Hopefully Kevin will return for the remaining episodes, if everyone works together, but it looks like Yellowstone will end after this season.'",
        "R.I.P. John Dutton? Rumors Swirl that Costner's Character May Be Killed Off in a Surprising Fashion Like Succession's Logan RoyJust days after Yellowstone star Dawn Olivieri told DailyMail.com\u00a0that Costner's John Dutton could be killed off, another report seemed to lend credence to that.A report from Showbiz 411\u00a0claimed John Dutton will, 'meet a similar fate' than Brian Cox's character Logan Roy from the hit HBO series Succession.Logan was surprisingly killed off in the third episode of the show's final season, while on board one of his private planes.\u00a0As for Dutton's apparent swan song, the source claimed Sheridan was working on how to say goodbye to the Dutton family patriarch.'The whole team is down in Texas now meeting, and trying to figure out how to do it. I'm sure Taylor Sheridan has it worked out more or less,' a source claims, adding, 'We all knew Kevin would leave eventually,' the source said.'I think the main show will go on for at least one more season after, they'll have to see how it goes. Remember, this isn't until 2024. A lot can happen,' the source added.",
        "Taylor Sheridan's 'God Complex' Caused Friction Between Him and CostnerJust weeks ago sources told DailyMail.com\u00a0that Yellowstone creator Taylor Sheridan had developed a 'God complex' that was at the heart of his conflict with Kevin Costner.'Certain people in charge of the production developed a God complex,' an insider revealed.Costner was reportedly left frustrated that his concerns over the show's direction were dismissed by Sheridan.\u00a0Costner - who also serves as an executive producer on Yellowstone - was reportedly told by Sheridan to, 'stick to acting' when questioning the direction of the popular series.'Kevin will forever be proud of and grateful for Yellowstone and the cast is like family to him,' the source said of Costner, who recently nabbed a Golden Globe Award for best actor for his portrayal of John Dutton.'He just felt like Yellowstone is headed in a direction that was not in line with their initial vision and he was met with criticism, including that he should just stick to acting.'",
        "And Now... a Writer's Strike...Adding to uncertainty swirling around the fate of the back half of Yellowstone Season 5 is the Writers Guild of America strike that went into effect on Tuesday.All movie and TV writers who are part of the Guild must stop all work for any companies represented by the\u00a0Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which is essentially every major movie studio, TV network, TV production company and streaming service.The last time the Writers Guild of America went on strike was in November 2007 - a stand-off that lasted 100 days, setting a new precedent for writers being paid for their work being used in 'new media' such as the streaming services that are now ubiquitous.As for Yellowstone, since it's unclear how far Sheridan is in the writing process, it's unknown how the strike will impact the back half of Season 5.\u00a0With a strike in place, it's possible for production to take place on Yellowstone if the scripts have been completed... but it would bar any further writing on any of the scripts from Tuesday until the strike comes to an end.\u00a0"
