        "JERUSALEM, May 3 (Reuters) - Israel and Palestinian armed groups in Gaza agreed to a ceasefire early on Wednesday, two Palestinian officials said, after the death of a Palestinian hunger striker in Israeli custody a day earlier sparked cross-border exchanges of fire.",
        "The \"reciprocal and simultaneous\" ceasefire went into effect at 3:30 a.m. (0030 GMT) and was brought about with efforts from Egyptian, Qatari and United Nations officials, the sources told Reuters. (Reporting by Nidal al-Mughrabi; Writing by Henriette Chacar Editing by Shri Navaratnam)"
