        "Nonbinary activist Deni Todorovi\u0107 split from their high-profile manager Pru Corrigan the same day they goaded brands to drop them over a shocking admission that they use cocaine.\u00a0",
        "The 35-year-old, who uses they/them pronouns, admitted they 'love a line of cocaine' and invited brands to drop them if they disagreed last Friday.Just hours later, Corrigan, who\u00a0founded PR consultancy group One Day Dream, announced she had parted ways with the influencer as a client.\u00a0'I am no longer behind the wheel of Deni's car,' Corrigan said in a message posted to Instagram.'It's with mixed emotions that I say goodbye to this time in my life. I am very grateful for the time we shared as partners but like everything else - the show much go on.'",
        "Daily Mail Australia has reached out to Todorovi\u0107 for comment.\u00a0It comes after the fashionista announced they take cocaine recreationally and won't apologise for it.\u00a0The stylist\u00a0dared luxury brands to drop them if they have a problem with their admission before calling for the decriminalisation of drugs.\u00a0Todorovi\u0107, who controversially partnered with swimwear brand Seafolly earlier this year, shared their thoughts on illegal substances in an Instagram post last week.",
        "They said they are 'partial to a line or two [of cocaine] just like every AFL footy player who does it behind the world's back'.\u00a0Todorovi\u0107 went on to extol the virtues of drug legalisation - noting how the policy has reduced crime rates in countries like Portugal - then challenged 'any of the brands I work with' to nix their deals with them if that 'doesn't align with your ethos'.",
        "Just a few weeks prior, Australian swimwear brand Seafolly distanced themselves from the non-binary activist\u00a0after a photoshoot which left consumers divided.\u00a0At the time, some feminist critics said that having a nonbinary biological male promote women's swimwear was 'erasing women', and noted the unfortunate proximity of the Seafolly campaign to International Women's Day.",
        "Writer Alexandra Marshall was one of those who had spoken out against brand's partnership with Todorovi\u010d, saying the swimwear brand was 'mocking women' and said she would boycott Seafolly.'Bye @seafolly. Never again. Been buying swimsuits from you for many years. Never again,' she posted on Twitter.A source with knowledge of the situation said: 'Seafolly will never work with Deni again. They said, in so many words, that Deni is a liability to the brand and alienating customers. There were even talks of financiers withdrawing investment.'Seafolly issued a public statement at the time of the scandal, insisting that they are 'supportive of all women' and that supermodel Joanna Halpin was always their official ambassador, not Deni.\u00a0Since the scandal, the once-celebrated swimwear brand has been put up for sale\u00a0less than three years after it was saved from administration."
