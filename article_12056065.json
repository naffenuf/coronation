        "Avid bakers and cake business owners across the country have put their skills to the test creating bespoke cakes to celebrate the King\u2019s coronation.",
        "On Saturday, Charles was crowned King and while the UK witnessed its first coronation in more than 70 years, skilled bakers were hard at work to create intricately designed bakes.From crown-shaped cakes to bakes imprinted with the King\u2019s insignia, the sweet treats have garnered interest on social media for their complex designs.Lee McAuliffe, from Shave in Blackburn \u2013 who has been baking for 10 years, said his coronation cake took 15 hours to make.\u201cIn total, including baking, around 15 hours. This was an order for a client to celebrate (the coronation),\u201d the 46-year-old told the PA news agency.",
        "The two-tiered cake is compromised of a chocolate fudge crown with chocolate fudge buttercream and a gluten-free lemon sponge with lemon curd buttercream for the lower tier.Mr McAuliffe used his \u201ctrademark\u201d look whilst incorporating Union flag bunting to accompany the crown-shaped cake.\u201cI knew I wanted a crown to be the main part of the design and obviously, Union flag bunting had to make an appearance,\u201d he said.\u201cMy lower tier has become a bit of my trademark look so with the gold this worked well in combining all the elements I thought of.\u201dCatherine Davies, who turns 52 on Sunday, owns her own cake business but is also a teaching assistant in Tunbridge Wells, and created a triple-layered vanilla cake with lemon and elderflower buttercream ahead of the coronation.",
        "The cake was part of a raffle with the winner feeling \u201cdelighted\u201d after receiving the sweet treat.",
        "\u201cThe drip cake is one of my most popular cakes. The lady who won it wanted a nod to the coronation on it,\u201d Ms Davies, from Crowborough in East Sussex, told PA.\u201cShe was delighted to win the cake and was very happy when she saw it, commenting on how beautiful it was.\u201dMs Davies said the bespoke creation, which dons the official insignia, took around two hours to make.\u201cI thought the insignia on the top was elegant and looked good in gold, matching the drip down the sides,\u201d she said.\u201cThe flavour was chosen by the customer after I gave her lots of options. It\u2019s a lovely summery flavour.\u201dThe business owner, who has been baking professionally for five years, celebrated the coronation with her son, who is home from university dining on scones with cream and jam."
