        "The FTSE 100-listed business said growth was driven by price-mix and volume growth in its sparkling, energy and coffee divisions, but this was offset by falls in stills, primarily due to an anticipated weakness in water.\u00a0Coca-Cola HBC shares\u00a0rose today and were up 2.47 per cent or 60.00p to\u00a02,493.00p this afternoon.\u00a0In the past year the company's share price has surged over 50 per cent.\u00a0",
