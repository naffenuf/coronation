        "Aaron Rodgers and Sauce Gardner attended the Knicks' Game 2 on TuesdayAnd the 22-year-old Gardner was the target of jokes from the quarterbackDailyMail.com provides all the latest international sports newsAaron Rodgers and new Jets teammate Sauce Gardner were courtside for the Knicks' Game 2 win over the Heat on Tuesday, and the second-year pro showed his youth in a hilarious exchange with the quarterback.",
        "Taking their seats around a who's-who of celebrities, Gardner saw some of his favorite stars - but was forced to admit he wasn't familiar with Jessica Alba.\u00a0'When we were getting seated, [Rodgers] was just picking on me a little bit for being young,' Gardner told reporters on Wednesday.\u00a0'We were getting seated and he was like 'we're about to sit by,' what's her name? 'We're about to sit by Jessica Alba,' and I'm just like 'Oh, I don't know who that is.' And he just looked at me, he looked at me like I'm crazy.'Given Gardner is just 22 years old, and the fact that some of Alba's biggest flicks like 'Fantastic Four' (2005), 'Sin City' (2005) and 'Good Luck Chuck' (2007) came out almost two decades ago, it's not hugely surprising that the cornerback wouldn't know her.",
        "Nonetheless, it was clearly a source of amusement for the 39-year-old Rodgers throughout the night.'It was just great to be able to sit over there, and I got to meet her,' Gardner said.\u00a0'And one of her friends, who was from Detroit [like him], actually. It was great vibes, but that whole night he would just keep asking me out of nowhere, like 'do you know who that person is? I'm like 'bro, that's Amar'e Stoudemire, I know who that is. Now you're just picking on me.''",
        "Alba was far from the only celebrity in the crowd, as tennis star Roger Federer, 'Entourage' actor Jerry Ferrara and 'Outer Banks' actress Madelyn Cline were in attendance as well.Furthermore, Gardner mentioned that he was able to meet comedians Chris Rock, Dave Chappelle and Tracy Morgan.",
        "Alba seemed to have a great time at the event, thanking Knicks forward Julius Randle after the game.'Congrats @nyknicks on the W! Thank you @juliusrandle30 for the invite, you are a kind soul,' Alba wrote on Instagram.'And it was awesome watching your leadership on the court.'The Knicks will now play the Games 3 and 4 in Miami before heading back to New York for Game 5 and a potential Game 7.\u00a0"
