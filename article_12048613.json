        "Roy Hodgson labelled Harry Kane as one of the best players in world football and expects his goal-threat to pose a hard challenge for Crystal Palace during their visit to Tottenham on Saturday.",
        "The Spurs and England striker has scored 25 times this Premier League campaign, with four games remaining to try and better his record tally of 30 goals from the 2017/18 season.Former Three Lions boss Hodgson, who handed Kane his senior international debut in 2015, lauded Tottenham\u2019s talisman, whose form has been a shining light for the north London club despite their struggles throughout a turbulent campaign.The Palace managed said: \u201cKane is one of the very best players in world football and is an outstanding goalscorer.\u201cThe need for you to defend well as a group becomes even harder, because one thing we aren\u2019t going to do or be capable of doing is to say we are going to nullify Harry Kane because \u2018X\u2019 is going to mark him and that\u2019s the end of the story. We know that won\u2019t be able to work.\u201cWe\u2019re going to do it by good corporate defending. We\u2019ll have to try and restrict as much as we can any good service to him.",
        "\u201cWe\u2019ll have to be very much aware when he\u2019s in and around the penalty area, where we\u2019ve got to get close to him and try and stop the space he has to create the room he needs to get the shots away. When he gets shots away they go in the goal, it\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen for the last goodness knows how long.",
        "\u201cI have an awful amount of respect for Harry Kane. He made his debut with England while I was the manager, and over the years I\u2019ve watched him go from strength to strength and get better and better and cause havoc with almost all the defences he meets.\u201dPalace have witnessed an upturn in form under Hodgson since his return in March, having picked up four wins in six \u2013 a run the manager attributes to the defensive performances of his team.Last month\u2019s consecutive clean sheets against Southampton and Everton were the first time the Eagles had done so since April 2022 under former manager Patrick Vieira.\u201cMuch of our work is on defending,\u201d said Hodgson.\u201cIf you wanted to say to me what\u2019s most impressed you about (Michael) Olise, (Eberechi) Eze, (Jordan) Ayew, (Wilfried) Zaha and (Jeffrey) Schlupp, it\u2019s been there defending work, how well they\u2019ve defended from the front, how well they\u2019ve screened things off and made it difficult for teams in midfield to play.\u201cMarc Guehi and (Joachim) Andersen are very good players. They\u2019re good defenders and good on the ball, which is very useful because it helps you start attacks, switch play and develop the composure you need to build attacks up.\u201cThey\u2019re both very useful to the club and would be to any club because they\u2019re good players.\u201d"
