        "As Coronation fever sweeps the UK and much of the world, Meghan Markle will be busy preparing for Archie's 'low key' birthday party while her husband Harry's swiftly visits Britain for the biggest day of his father's life.",
        "The Duchess of Sussex is said to be planning a small-scale event at their $14.7million (\u00a311.6m) Montecito mansion supported by her mother Doria Ragland and a select group of friends.Prince Harry is believed to already be in the UK - and may even be using a private jet to help him get back home quickly, apparently adopting a schedule to get 'in and out of the UK in 24 hours'.If he shuns all other royal events and is back in the air by 3pm UK time tomorrow, Harry will land in Los Angeles by around 5pm Californian time, meaning he could be back home for the tail-end of the party and putting his two children to bed.But while rain has been falling in London, Meghan, who declined her invite to the Coronation, could choose to throw the party in the family's manicured gardens for Archie and his friends because the weather is set fair for Saturday in California.A source told People: 'It's going to be a low-key party at home. They'll have friends around them and Meghan's mom, Doria [Ragland]. Meghan will definitely have support that weekend.'Lilibet, who turns two in June, will also be at the centre of the party because Archie and his little sister are inseparable. 'They are so sweet together. Archie loves Lili. He's such a sweet boy. When she's not around, he asks, 'Where's Lili?'', the insider said.",
        "Along with Doria and Archie's friends, Tyler Perry,\u00a0Princess Lilibet's billionaire godfather, is likely to be a guest.\u00a0Archie's godparents are\u00a0Tiggy Pettifer, Harry and William's former nanny, and Mark Dyer, Harry's friend and former royal aide, but they are believed to be in the UK.Recently, Harry and Meghan's celebrity friend Gayle King declared they are\u00a0in a 'really good place' and have made the 'best' decision for Meghan to stay in the US while Harry attends the Coronation in London.\u00a0Ms King has said it is 'right' that Harry will fly to the UK because he will be supporting his father in Westminster Abbey.Harry is expected to return to the US immediately after Saturday's Coronation so that he can celebrate Archie's birthday, and will not be staying in the UK for any of the other Coronation celebrations, beyond seeing his father crowned in Westminster Abbey.This morning a private jet from Van Nuys airport in California landed at Farnborough, the VIP airport closest to Windsor Castle.\u00a0Van Nuys is just an hour from Harry and Meghan's Montecito mansion, but it is not yet known if he was on board.\u00a0If the duke has used a fuel-guzzling private jet instead of a commercial flight, it will raise yet more questions about Harry's campaigning on climate change, an issue which he claimed at the UN last year had\u00a0left him feeling 'battered' and 'helpless'.",
        "Tonight Harry is expected to spend a final night at Frogmore Cottage after his father decided to evict him and his American wife just days after the release of his memoir Spare.The Duke of Sussex will see his father King Charles III crowned at Westminster Abbey. But there is speculation he will have no formal role in the service and may even be sat several rows back from his brother William and other working royals.Royal commentators have considered whether he will even be allowed to fit within the processions to the Abbey. They have also suggested that he could face \u2018uniform humiliation\u2019 as he may not be allowed to wear his military garb.",
        "It is understood the duke will only be in the UK for around 24 hours so he can get home for his son Archie\u2019s fourth birthday, which is the same day as the Coronation.The aircraft that landed at Farnborough is a 2019 Gulfstream G550 fixed-wing two-engine business jet with 20 seats on board.\u00a0A new Gulfstream G550 costs $62million, while preowned models retail from $14million.It is owned by NantWorks, a California-based parent company of firms in the biotech, healthcare AI and mobility industries.",
        "The founder of NantWorks is Patrick Soon-Shiong, a surgeon and pharma billionaire who owns shares in the LA Lakers with his wife. He is believed to be close to the Bidens.",
        "NantWorks has worked with Global Citizen, with Harry and Meghan attending one of their Vax Live events to promote Covid-19 vaccine efficacy worldwide.\u00a0Dr Soon-Shiong has also supported Global Citizen, opening a plant and health facility that aims to produce vaccines by 2025.\u00a0Regarding Harry\u2019s brief visit, a source told The Sun: \u2018Harry will be in and out of the UK in 24 hours. He will only be doing the Coronation service then leaving.\u2019Asked in an interview in January whether he would attend the Coronation if invited, Harry said \u2018the door is always open\u2019.It was then reported last month that the duke would be coming to the Coronation alone, leaving Meghan at home with their children Archie and Lilibet.Buckingham Palace has since said it is \u2018pleased to confirm\u2019 the Duke of Sussex will be at Westminster Abbey on Saturday. There had been uncertainty at the Palace over the Sussexes\u2019 attendance.",
        "It was said to have left royal officials unable to sign off arrangements for seating plans, transport and security, as the duke\u2019s confirmation came after the official RSVP date.Coronation organisers admitted that they were stressed about Harry\u2019s plans and said that it was like \u2018trying to communicate with Mars\u2019.Speaking to The Mail on Sunday, royal insiders said they were still seeking confirmation of \u2018when he is coming, when he is going back and whether he is happy with his seating position in the Abbey\u2019.",
        "It came as Meghan signed a mega-money deal with a talent agency representing Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, LeBron James and Serena Williams that will earn her tens of millions of dollars and heralds the start of her very public comeback."
