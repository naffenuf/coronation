        "May 3 (Reuters) - MetLife Inc's first-quarter profit missed Wall street estimates on Wednesday as growing economic uncertainty hurt the insurer's investment income, sending its shares down 2% in extended trading.",
        "Adjusted net investment income fell 8% to $4.6 billion in a quarter marred by a string of high-profile bank collapses that roiled financial stocks.Chief Executive Michel Khalaf said 2023 is shaping up to be another year of uncertainty. \"We remain focused on managing risk across economic cycles and controlling what we can to deliver for our shareholders and our stakeholders,\" Khalaf said.The company also said its board has approved a new $3 billion share buyback plan, in a sign of \"financial strength and balanced approach to capital management\".This is in addition to the $202 million left under its previous plan announced last year, the company said.Adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues - excluding pension risk transfers (PRT) at MetLife - rose 3% to $11.54 billion.The company posted an adjusted profit of $1.52 per share, for the three months ended March 31, while analysts on average had estimated a profit of $1.83, according to Refinitiv data.Rival insurer Prudential Financial Inc had reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday due to a decline in its assets under management.(Reporting by Mehnaz Yasmin in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel and Arun Koyyur)"
