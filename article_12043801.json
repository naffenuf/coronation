        "May 3 (Reuters) - Mosaic Co missed Wall Street estimates for first-quarter profit on Wednesday, hit by lower prices of potash and other crop fertilizers even as the fertilizer maker sold higher volumes of crop nutrients.",
        "Prices of fertilizers fell in the January-to-March quarter as supply from Belarus, the third largest exporter of potash, resumed and costs of key input materials like nitrogen came down.The company, however, said it expects annual shipments from Belarus will be down 5-6 million tonnes from pre-sanction export rates.Fertilizer prices soared last year after a supply crisis caused by Western sanctions on Russia and Belarus.\"While fertilizer prices have pulled back from last year's peak levels, they remain constructive. At the same time, North American fertilizer demand has accelerated as growers are being (incentivized) to maximize yields,\" said Chief Executive Officer James O'Rourke in a statement.Mosaic, the world's largest producer of finished phosphate products, saw a 5.9% rise in sales volumes of phosphates and a 5.6% increase in sales volumes of potash from last year.First-quarter revenue fell 7.7% to $3.6 billion from the year-ago quarter, while the total capital expenditures forecast for 2023 in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion remains unchanged from February.The Tampa, Florida-based company reported earnings of $1.14 per share, excluding items, for the three months ended March 31, compared with analysts' estimate of $1.29 per share, according to Refinitiv data.Peer CF Industries on Monday beat profit estimates on better gross margins as nitrogen prices weakened during the first quarter on higher supply during a period of low global demand.
