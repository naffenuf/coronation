        "Amanda Seyfried\u00a0looked fresh and rested on Tuesday morning outside the Carlyle Hotel in New York City.",
        "The Dropout actress was seen with little makeup on and her blonde hair down as she wore a black coat, blue jeans and black military boots.The star smiled at fans who waited outside for her as she held onto a black nylon purse before taking her black sunglasses off.This comes the day after the Big Love star stunned at the annual star-studded Met Gala.The 37-year-old wore an eye-popping nude leotard with beads everywhere that draped over her slim frame.\u00a0",
        "The gown was from Oscar de la\u00a0Renta, and her jewelry from Cartier.She added open-toed\u00a0metallic gold pumps.\u00a0The performer, who won her first Golden Globe earlier this year for her starring role as Elizabeth Holmes in Hulu's The Dropout, styled her golden blonde tresses in\u00a0voluminous tight curls that cascaded down her back.\u00a0Despite oozing confidence at the\u00a0Costume Institute Gala or the Costume Institute Benefit,\u00a0Seyfried admitted in December that\u00a0still gets nervous on the red carpet.'I really enjoy experimenting with fashion on photoshoots, but the red carpet is a different animal; it\u2019s very brief and it\u2019s very frantic,' she explained to\u00a0Harper's Bazaar.The Oscar nominee continued: 'You don\u2019t really have enough time. When I\u2019m on a shoot, it feels more like acting \u2013 it\u2019s more about the art in fashion, which is really fun for me.'\u00a0",
        "'You can take as long as you like to feel comfortable and make the clothing work for you, which just isn\u2019t really the case on the red carpet,'\u00a0Pennsylvania native, who is married to Thomas Sadoski, noted.\u00a0",
        "Seyfried then praised her longtime stylist Elizabeth Stewart for being 'so savvy' and 'amazing' at finding her 'pieces that she knows' suit her.\u00a0'She has these incredible relationships with designers,' the actress insisted. 'She understands what will look good on my body and she knows my boundaries with fashion, and I am so grateful for that.'\u00a0Over the years, Seyfried said she has begun to prioritize comfort over everything.\u00a0",
        "'I think my style has really always stayed in one place \u2013 it has evolved here and there and of course my body has changed when I\u2019ve had kids, but I have always been one to wear sweatpants as often as I can,' she mused.\u00a0\u00a0The star also said jeans are a staple in her wardrobe and if something 'works for' her she doesn't 'move away from it.'\u00a0'I live on a farm for the most part now \u2013 no one is photographing me, so I just dress how I want,' she pointed out.\u00a0Seyfried said she aspires to keep her style 'timeless' and to avoid 'trends' but acknowledged she might 'just not brave enough' just yet.\u00a0",
        "'I think that embracing what truly feels like you, and what you feel comfortable in is how you look your best,' she concluded.\u00a0Kim Kardashian, Kendall and Kylie Jenner, Margot Robbie, Florence Pugh,\u00a0Vanessa Hudgens, Lily James, Miranda Kerr and Gigi Hadid were also among the faces who will be at the Met Gala."
