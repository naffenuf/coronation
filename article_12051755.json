        "Princess Charlene of Monaco appeared elegant this evening when in LondonFor all the latest Royal news, pictures and video click here\u00a0Princess Charlene of Monaco\u00a0stunned in an ethereal ensemble as she joined Prince Albert at a\u00a0Buckingham Palace reception hosted by King Charles on the eve of his coronation.",
        "The former Olympic swimmer, 45, looked effortlessly elegant when stepping out with her husband at the lavish occasion in London, ahead of attending the British monarch's historic event tomorrow at Westminster Abbey.\u00a0Charlene opted for a light blue coordinating co-ord, featuring wide-fit trousers and a billowing one-shoulder top with an asymmetrical hemline and dazzling gemstone embellishments.\u00a0The mother-of-two - who was also joined at the event by other foreign royals, including Queen Letizia of Spain and Princess Mary of Denmark - completed the stylish number with a silver clutch and matching strappy heels.If that wasn't enough glitz for one outfit, she also completed her glamorous ensemble with shimmering floral diamond earrings.",
        "Her husband looked equally charming in a suit, which he teamed with a light blue tie to match his wife's outfit and a crisp white shirt.\u00a0Last month,\u00a0Princess Charlene and Prince Albert of Monaco appeared in public with their children for the first time since the palace was forced to deny rumours the couple's marriage was on the rocks - and they even matched their outfits again.The family looked picture-perfect as Charlene put her arm around eight-year-old Prince Jacques and placed her other hand on Princess Gabriella's shoulders as they went to a match as part of the\u00a0Sainte Devote Rugby Tournament.",
        "Charlene looked stylish in a white top and white trousers, layered with a navy blue blazer which was embroidered with the clubs rugby logo.She opted for bright red lipstick and red nails to match and shaded herself with translucent sunglasses.Meanwhile Prince Albert, 65, opted for smart trousers with a white shirt and a red tie and donned the same blazer as his wife.The couple's eight-year-old twins looked animated as they watched the game, with Jacques, who sported a pair of blue wayfairer sunglasses, raising his hands and cheering at one point.Before the event began, Charlene chatted to two young rugby players about the match while she carried the match ball.",
        "The sweet family appearance came weeks after a French publication reported Princess Charlene and Prince Albert were in the process of a divorce - something the palace has strenuously denied.After ROYAUT\u00c9 reported their 12-year marriage was coming to an end, a spokesman said the couple 'formally deny the malicious rumours peddled by the magazine'.\u00a0In recent weeks the couple have put on a united front at events around the principality, including a memorial mass service for Prince Albert's late father, Prince Rainier, earlier this month.However, Princess Charlene fuelled rumours her marriage was on the rocks when she was spotted on a solo trip to Milan last month without wearing her wedding ring.",
        "She later returned to Monaco and attended an awards ceremony alongside her husband, and was once again wearing the ring.However, later that day, the couple made a joint appearance at the Monte Carlo Woman of the Year awards, where Charlene appeared to be wearing her wedding ring - pouring cold water on the split rumours.",
        "The plot seemed to thicken at the next royal engagement, when Prince Albert attended the Rose Ball in Monaco without his wife present.Last month, Albert revealed Charlene is 'excited and happy' about the royal project to restore the palace amid the rumours.The royal claimed his wife 'shares the joy' of the eight-year-long project in which Italian renaissance frescoes within the palace were brought back to life after other royals had covered them over with paint.",
        "Speaking to Hello! magazine from the palace as the restored works were unveiled, Prince Albert suggested his wife was enthusiastic about the project.When asked about his South African-born wife, he said: 'Princess Charlene was excited and happy that we were able to carry out this work.'Last year, she was showing some of her guests the state apartments and really enjoyed showing them the frescoes.''It shows how much she cares about the project and her desire to share the family's joy regarding these beautiful works.'\u00a0",
        "Elsewhere in his interview, Prince Albert referred to his late mother, Hollywood star Grace Kelly, who first began to decorate the palace when she moved to Monaco following her marriage to Prince Rainier.Describing his mother as a woman with 'assured taste', he said he believed his parents were watching over him and his family and that they would 'encourage us to continue on this path'.The pair's relationship timeline has hardly been smooth sailing; rumours about the state of their marriage began to swirl after Charlene was absent from Monaco for most of 2021 while having medical treatment in her native South Africa.The mother-of-two was admitted to a Swiss clinic to be treated for exhaustion on her return - but is now back in full swing with royal duties and public appearances.",
        "Charlene and Albert married in July 2011 after the prince proposed with a handcrafted pear-cut diamond flanked by smaller diamonds designed by Paris-based Italian jeweller Repossi.Later, during the wedding service, the couple exchanged 18-carat white gold platinum rings by Cartier, with Charlene laughing as she placed the ring on her husband's finger.At the time of the wedding, Charlene was dubbed the 'Runaway Bride' by the French media after allegedly trying to flee before the ceremony, but the reports were always denied.",
