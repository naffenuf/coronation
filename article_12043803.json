I think there is some risk that we have pulled forward a lot of the good news and the second half of the year is going to be still choppy.\"",
        "The energy sector fell 1.7% as oil settled 4.3% lower at $68.60 a barrel. It was the second straight day of steep losses for oil as investors fretted about the health of the U.S. economy.The consumer discretionary sector was also a drag, falling 1.5%, as shares of Aritzia Inc plunged 20.8% after the company reported quarterly results.Utilities were a bright spot, advancing 1.3%.
