        "PARIS, May 4 (Reuters) - France's Foreign Ministry sought to reassure Italy on Thursday after comments by the French interior minister that were critical of Italy's prime minister.",
        "The statement came minutes before Italy's foreign minister canceled a planned trip to Paris later on Thursday.\"The relationship between France and Italy is based on mutual respect, between our two countries and between their leaders,\" the ministry said in a statement.\"It is also in a spirit of solidarity that the French government wishes to work with Italy to face the common challenge represented by the rapid increase in migratory flows, in particular from the central Mediterranean.\" (Reporting by John Irish; Editing by Alison Williams)"
