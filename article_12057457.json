        "'I'm going say this to you honestly, a lot of people don't know this about him, but he has an amazing sense of humour that we haven't seen yet, so I think we may in the future see a little bit of a glimpse of that - and of course, inclusiveness.'Richie revealed that he immediately jumped at the chance to perform at the celebratory concert, saying: 'The answer no matter what you had planned for that day, the answer is yes right away. And then the second thing that comes up is you start thinking: \"Well, wait a minute, what am I going to wear?\"'The singer admitted he did initially question if it was a joke but felt 'honoured' when it was confirmed to be true.'It's an honour because it's every 80 years, except for the Queen who just took it all the way to the end. But I mean, this is amazing,' he said.The singer added: 'He's throwing a party, think about that. This is unusual. I understand this has not happened this often where you have this kind of thing after the big one. So I'm very happy about this. He's very loose.'"
