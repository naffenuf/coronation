        "Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah wants to keep breaking records after another landmark goal secured a 1-0 victory over Brentford.",
        "The Egypt international struck from close range in the 13th minute for his 30th of the season \u2013 the fourth time in six campaigns he has reached that mark \u2013 and his 100th goal at Anfield.He became the first Liverpool player to score in nine successive home matches and in doing so went level with Steven Gerrard in fifth place in the club\u2019s all-time goalscoring list with 186.\u201cIt means a lot to me. I said before, I feel (at) home here, I\u2019m happy,\u201d he told Sky Sports.\u201cIt\u2019s something that makes me proud, to be fair. I work really hard and everybody knows that, everybody sees that.\u201cI\u2019m just motivated to keep breaking records and just scoring goals and winning games for the team.\u201dManager Jurgen Klopp has almost run out of ways to describe the 30-year-old\u2019s continued excellence during their time together at the club. I'm just motivated to keep breaking records and just scoring goals and winning games for the team.  Mohamed Salah  \u201cThe numbers he creates, we all know that after his career he will be seen as one of the all-time greats, that\u2019s clear,\u201d said the Reds boss.\u201cBut now he is still in the career and some people might not appreciate him enough, but we do.",
        "\u201cHe deserves all the praise he gets already and he will get even more after his career, that\u2019s how it is, because in a club with the all-time greats we had in the past, being the first one who scores in nine consecutive home games is super-special.\u201cScoring again 30 goals this season is super-special and setting up a lot of goals as well \u2013 he is so often involved in our goals, not only with the assist or the finish, very often with the second or third-last pass as well which is as important.\u201dA sixth successive victory \u2013 and their third in a week \u2013 moved Liverpool to within a point of fourth-placed Manchester United, who have two matches in hand.\u201cWinning three in a row at home is absolutely special. It will not be a game the people in the stadium tell their grandchildren about but it\u2019s a game (where) there was a lot to enjoy because the fight was exceptional,\u201d added Klopp.\u201cThe focus level the boys showed was exceptional, the concentration top and again a lot of good signs for us, how we could look in the future.\u201cWe have to do that more consistent, we have to learn, we have to adapt, but a lot of good signs and I am really pleased with that.\u201d",
        "Brentford head coach Thomas Frank felt his side deserved more from their display.\u201cI think, in many ways,\u00a0 we performed enough to get something from this game,\u201d he said.\u201cI was very happy with the performance. The goal we could have done better in the second phase on a set-piece but besides that I thought we got better and better.\u201d"
