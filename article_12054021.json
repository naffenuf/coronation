        "The five-year-old royal attended Westminster Abbey with his parents the Prince and Princess of Wales and siblings Prince George and Princess Charlotte.He held hands with his sister as the pair walked behind their parents as they made their way into the abbey.During the first half of the ceremony, Louis could be seen letting out a big yawn, while also taking the opportunity to point out something of interest to his sister Charlotte.",
        "He yawned again shortly after the King was crowned, just after midday.Shortly afterwards, television footage showed he was no longer sitting in the row.It is understood that plans were in place for him to leave the service at some point.However, he returned for the national anthem at the end of the service and the procession out of the abbey. Footage showed him singing God Save The King.Louis was regally dressed in a Hainsworth Garter Blue Doeskin Tunic with specially designed lace work embellishment to the collar, cuffs and fronts, made by bespoke Savile Row tailors Dege and Skinner.",
