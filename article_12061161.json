        "Todd Cantwell believes Rangers will come back next season ready to battle for honours.",
        "A trophyless campaign for the Govan club has four cinch Premiership games remaining following the 1-0 win over Aberdeen at Ibrox on Sunday where the former Norwich player, who joined Michael Beale\u2019s squad in January, scored the only goal of the game.Rangers have been linked with several players including Cantwell\u2019s former Carrow Road team-mate Kieran Dowell, but the 25-year-old midfielder knows what is expected next season, no matter who is at the club.He said: \u201cPlaying for Rangers \u2013 you\u2019ve got a big responsibility.\u201cThis season hasn\u2019t gone how we wanted to go so it\u2019s important for us next season to be in a great position to change the outcome.\u201cPre-season is always important. I know the manager is looking at recruitment but it\u2019s also important for us as individuals to get your body in the place where you are ready to start the season well.",
        "\u201cIn terms of recruitment, it\u2019s kind of irrelevant because you\u2019ve a group of players in pre-season all fighting to be in the starting 11.\u201cWe\u2019ve got everything to play for next season and the hunger in the dressing room will be real.\u201cWhoever comes in, whoever leaves, whoever is playing for Rangers, it\u2019s important to know you\u2019ll be fighting for your spot and to win every game.\u201d",
        "On the link with Dowell, Cantwell said: \u201cHe\u2019s a good player. He\u2019s someone I enjoyed playing with, we had success at Norwich and he\u2019s a top lad.\u201cNone of that is really to do with me. It\u2019s the manager\u2019s choice, the club\u2019s choice and his choice.\u201cIf that is something that happens then I\u2019m sure the Rangers fans will be happy.\u201dCantwell would recommend Scottish football to players from the English Championship but said: \u201cIt\u2019s important you weigh up your opportunities.\u201cI can only speak for myself but it was a massive decision but also one that I\u2019m really proud of making.\u201cIt\u2019s not something that is particularly common and I saw it as an opportunity to come up here and show what I\u2019m about.\u201d"
