        "A goalless draw ensured Arbroath will play Scottish Championship football next season while Hamilton must try to do the same via the play-offs.",
        "Accies began the day bottom of the table and staring at automatic relegation but a point lifted them above Cove Rangers on goal difference.Instead, they will take on either Alloa or Airdrie in the League One play-offs as they attempt to secure second tier football again.Chances were at a premium \u2013 Hamilton\u2019s Daniel O\u2019Reilly had a shot saved by Derek Gaston in the first half while in the second David Gold came close twice in quick succession for Arbroath, hitting the bar on the second occasion."
