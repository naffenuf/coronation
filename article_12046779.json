        "An artist has created a portrait of the King using Marmite and 42 slices of toasted bread to \u201craise a toast\u201d during coronation week.",
        "Nathan Wyburn, 33, from Cardiff, wanted to \u201ccelebrate\u201d the King\u2019s coronation by creating a piece of art using ingredients from his favourite sandwich, according to the Daily Mail, which consists of a fried egg, pesto, gruyere cheese and the famous yeast extract spread, all contained in an organic granary bap.Mr Wyburn told the PA news agency: \u201cWhen I found out that the King himself actually loves Marmite as part of his favourite sandwich, that seemed even more fitting to know that he would totally approve of this.\u201d",
        "The artist said altogether it took him two hours to create the artwork, using just one large jar of Marmite.The quirky artist said the \u201cmost tedious part\u201d of the process was spending half an hour toasting 42 slices of white bread in his four-piece toaster at his flat.\u201cIf a slice did slightly burn then I always just put it in a darker area of the portrait or scraped off the bits of burnt bread,\u201d he said.\u201cThe Marmite itself allows for a perfect tonal difference in the portrait \u2013 it\u2019s quite dark against the colour of the toast, so it allows me to get that contrast that I need for the portrait to pop out.\u201dThe former 2011 Britain\u2019s Got Talent contestant added that the King\u2019s \u201cdistinctive features\u201d helped him create the portrait.",
        "He said: \u201cI think what helps is that everybody knows what he looks like \u2013 that can be a bit of pressure at the same time.\u201cBut because he\u2019s got quite a lot of distinctive features, and he\u2019s of an age where it allows the face to have more character, it helped get those features to pop out with the Marmite because it\u2019s such a dark tone \u2013 it is perfect against the toasts.\u201cSo, (the King) being so instantly recognisable is a great help for me.\u201d",
        "Mr Wyburn had met Charles when he was the Prince of Wales, with the Queen Consort, and showed them some of the previous works he made using coffee.\u201cThere\u2019s a great connection between myself, my work and the royal family,\u201d he said.\u201cTo do this Marmite portrait just seemed like the most obvious fit for what I do as an artist.\u201dHe also assured that he and his housemates ate the whole Marmite portrait to ensure there was \u201cno waste\u201d.Mr Wyburn plans to commemorate the coronation at his nearby church, where he volunteers part-time and houses his art studio.The artist said: \u201cWe\u2019re setting up the TV and we\u2019re all going to sit there with a nice coffee, some sandwiches and maybe even some Marmite.",
        "\u201cWe\u2019re going to watch it and hopefully have a chilled-out Saturday celebrating the coronation.\u201d"
