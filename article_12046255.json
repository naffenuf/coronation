        "S4C - Channel 4 in Wales faces a probe amid claims of bullying at the company\u00a0The TV channel which launched the careers of One Show host Alex Jones and star actor Ioan Gruffudd is being investigated over bullying and a 'culture of fear.'",
        "Publicly-funded broadcaster S4C - Channel 4 in Wales which gets \u00a388million from licence fee payers - will be put through an independent external investigation into the allegation of 'toxic culture'.Alex Jones and actors such as Hornblower and Fantastic Four actor Gruffudd and Notting Hill star Rhys Ifans all appeared on Welsh language channel S4C before becoming household names.S4C was also the birthplace for cartoons SuperTed and Fireman Sam - but a probe was launched after staff described living in fear at work at the TV channel.But Carwyn Donovan of broadcasting Union Bectu said staff were 'regularly being brought to tears' and 'too scared to share their experiences'.",
        "In an open letter he claimed staffed complained of 'being ignored, belittled, undermined, or patronised by members of the management team'.It also said senior managers were 'aggressive and confrontational' if workers raised legitimate questions.Mr Donovan said that during a meeting with workers 'four staff members broke down in tears while giving their accounts of the situation.'The TV channel announced it will appoint a law firm to undertake an independent investigation into concerns raised.S4C chairman Rhodri Williams said the letter 'obviously didn't make for comfortable reading,' and that 'a number of points raised, if proved to be true, would give us serious concerns.'",
        "He said: 'They are not the type of things anyone responsible for any organisation would like to read, be that a private or a public organisation'.Mr Williams said he urged staff to come forward to share any concerns they may have and if allegations were proved he would take the 'necessary steps'.The TV channel based in Carmarthen has been running for 40 years after a political campaign for a Welsh-language service.",
        "Welsh Conservative's shadow culture minister Tom Giffard said: 'These allegations are deeply concerning, especially the wider impact on the reputation of our Welsh language broadcaster.'I welcome the fact that an independent external legal firm has been appointed to investigate what has happened.'It is essential that staff at all levels come forward at this time to share their experiences and that S4C engages fully with the investigation.'"
