        "Unai Emery hinted Aston Villa are closing in on Barcelona\u2019s director of football Mateu Alemany.",
        "The LaLiga leaders have already confirmed he will leave at the end of the season, with Villa his expected destination.It will be the next piece in the puzzle for Emery at Villa Park as the club looks to move to the next level.He said: \u201cMateu Alemany is a person with experiences, he has worked at a high level and, if he\u2019s coming here because it is a possibility, it will be a very good opportunity to create a strong structure with him.\u201cIt\u2019s not the moment to speak about some circumstances that could come here, about some expectation about who is coming here. When I was committed with the chairman Nassef (Sawiris) and with Wes (Edens), we were speaking about the objective in our future we want to create.\u201cWe want to strengthen our structure. To try to get another level going up with the team, with the players, with the structure we can create here.\u201d",
        "Villa go to Wolves on Saturday having dropped to eighth after the midweek results but remain in the hunt for a surprise European place.Emery recognises failing to qualify for Europe could impact the calibre of players the club could sign this summer but it will not change his ultimate goal.\u201cMaybe, yes, but it\u2019s not changing the mind I have, the idea we spoke about,\u201d he said.",
        "\u201cWe want to create a strong structure here, a strong mentality. You have to build a team like a family. If we are in Europe \u2013 we will add some possibility to take away trophies, playing more matches, for me it will be fantastic.\u201cIf it\u2019s not this year, my idea and objective is the same \u2013 try to play in Europe with Aston Villa. Not only just to play in Europe but I want to play in the Champions League with Aston Villa. \u201dPhilippe Coutinho, Matty Cash, Leon Bailey and Boubacar\u00a0Kamara have all resumed training and could be involved at Molineux.Emery added: \u201cThis week was fantastic. Coutinho started training on Monday, Kamara and Leon on Wednesday and Matty Cash started training with the group yesterday.\u201d"
