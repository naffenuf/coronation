        "North Dakota State forward Grant Nelson doubled down on options and plans to exit the program by entering the transfer portal, according to multiple reports.",
        "The All-Summit League first-team forward averaged 17.9 points and 9.3 rebounds per game last season. The NBA invited the 6-foot-11 prospect to the annual scouting combine.Nelson could still return to NDSU if he withdraws from the NBA draft by May 31, but Stadium and ESPN signaled very strong interest expected from competing college programs might complicate his decision.In a matchup with Kansas forward Jalen Wilson on Nov. 10, Nelson had 11 points, nine rebounds and five turnovers, shooting 3 of 10 from the field. He scored 17 points in the 2022-23 season opener against Arkansas.NBA executives provided a second-round projection in Nelson's assessment, which likely fed the league invitation to the combine. Few, if any, projected lottery picks attend the combine to participate in on-court workouts, but Nelson will be pitted against players fighting for second-round slots -- and non-guaranteed rookie contracts.Nelson arrived at NDSU, his only known Division I offer, as a 195-pound stretch forward. He expects to weigh in around 235 pounds at the combine.He played three seasons at North Dakota State and has two years of eligibility remaining due to the COVID waiver.--Field Level Media"
