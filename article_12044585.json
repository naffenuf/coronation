        "Ben Fordham has defended The Project host Waleed Aly after he was accused of siding with his old boss Chris Walker following the television producer's split from Carrie Bickmore.",
        "Walker, the former executive producer of The Project, was pictured with Aly at an AFL game last Sunday - leading to speculation Aly had 'picked a side' following Walker and Bickmore's break-up in January.The pair's catch-up at the footy raised eyebrows among media insiders given that Aly and\u00a0Bickmore had been friends and co-anchors for years.But speaking on his 2GB breakfast show on Thursday, Fordham said\u00a0Aly was 'not picking sides' at all and 'the premise of the story is utter crap'.'My experience is when two people go their separate\u00a0ways, people support both of them,'\u00a0Fordham began.",
        "'If you've been friends with them and you love both of them, then of course there are going to be occasions when you're hanging out with her or with him,' he added.'Just because a photo turns up with one of them, doesn't mean you've picked a side and are against the other.'The premise of the story is utter crap. Just because you've appeared in a photo with someone doesn't mean you're on their side. Divorce is tough enough already.'It comes after\u00a0Aly, who sat next to Bickmore on the panel of Channel Ten news program from 2015 to 2022, spent Sunday with her former partner at an AFL game.",
        "Posting to his Instagram Stories, Walker shared a photo of the two men smiling in the grandstands wearing Richmond Tigers merchandise.",
        "The mates sported matching grins as they leaned towards each other for the photo.\u00a0'Second best Tigers date after Evie,' he captioned the post, presumably referring to the birth of his eight-year-old daughter Evie.It comes three months after Bickmore announced her split from long-time partner Walker in January, saying the pair was focused on co-parenting their three children.She had been in a relationship with him for 11 years.",
        "'It's with immense sadness that Chris and I have decided to separate,' she said.'While this is a tough time, our focus is on parenting, loving and supporting our three children Ollie, Evie and Addie with everything that we've got.'They are doing great. We won't be making any further comment.'Bickmore and Walker's love story captured the hearts of Australians.They met as colleagues on The Project - she was a presenter and he was a producer - and they began dating in late 2012, two years after she lost her husband Greg Lange, the father of her eldest child Ollie, 15, to brain cancer.Despite his terminal diagnosis, Bickmore had married Lange in 2005 when she was just 25 years old.After Lange died in 2010 at the age of 35, a widowed Bickmore started the charity Carrie's Beanies for Brain Cancer in his memory.",
        "Two years later and Bickmore had found love again with Walker, who became a stepdad to Oliver, and with whom she later had Evie, born in 2015, and Adelaide, born in 2018."
