        "Tosin Adarabioyo is on an Inter Milan shortlist for centre-backs this summerThe 25-year-old largely\u00a0kept Erling Haaland quiet in recent Premier League gameAdarabioyo is open to leaving Craven Cottage given his inconsistent gametime\u00a0Fulham defender Tosin Adarabioyo is attracting interest from Inter Milan.",
        "The Italian club's scouts were impressed at how the 25-year old coped with Manchester City's Erling Haaland on Sunday and have added him to a list of potential targets to replace Milan Skriniar who is bound for Paris St Germain this summer.While interest is at an early stage, Adarabioyo, who started out at City's academy, is open to leaving Fulham this summer and to the challenge of playing in Serie A.Fulham activated an extension on his contract in January so he is tied to them for one more season.He had been in and out of the side this campaign but coach Marco Silva has started him for the last five games, where he has turned in some solid performances, notably against City where free scoring Haaland was limited to scoring from a penalty in Fulham's 2-1 defeat.",
        "Match statistics showed Haaland failed to manage any shots on target apart from the penalty and he normally averages 3.7 shots on target per game in the Premier League.Adarabioyo was responsible for nine clearances, the most in the game, and afterwards was asked how he limited his opponent's opportunities.'It's a very physical battle,' said Adarabioyo. 'He\u2019s a strong and fast guy, so you have to know what you\u2019re coming up against. Every forward has their qualities, and that [shooting with his first touch] is one of his qualities \u2014 everyone knows he can score.'",
        "Adarabioyo faces another stern test on Wednesday as Fulham face Liverpool."
