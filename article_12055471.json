        "Mohamed Salah scored his 100th Anfield goal in Liverpool's win over BrentfordJamie Carragher believes the Egyptian\u00a0will go down as one of the club's greatest\u00a0Micah Richards says Salah was destined for greatness from time at Fiorentina\u00a0 \u00a0Jamie Carragher has claimed Mohamed Salah would get into Liverpool's all-time XI after he scored his 100th goal at Anfield against Brentford.\u00a0",
        "Jurgen Klopp's side maintained their slim hopes of securing Champions League football next season with a 1-0 win over the Bees thanks to Salah's close-range finish.\u00a0It was the Egypt international's 30th across all competitions this season and more significantly, he secured a century of home goals for the Reds.\u00a0Carragher says Liverpool are 'very lucky' to have Salah and he will go down as the one of the club's greatest players once he departs.\u00a0\u00a0Speaking on Sky Sports, the former defender said: 'This club are very lucky to have some great goal scorers in the past.\u00a0",
        "'I think when Salah stops playing for the club he will go in there as one of the top. He will go into an all-star XI for Liverpool. I don\u2019t see it ever stopping until he stops.\u00a0'He\u2019s not an out and out striker but I wouldn\u2019t call him a winger either. I would call him a wide striker. He\u2019s been an absolute revelation.\u00a0'We always talk about Virgil but it\u2019s about Salah too. Those signings have changed the trajectory of the club. You could argue that Salah was the best signing as he was a steal.'Carragher also praised Salah for not dropping his levels in during a difficult campaign for the Reds.\u00a0",
        "'He\u2019s been Liverpool\u2019s best outfield player. Salah\u2019s level hasn\u2019t dropped. He\u2019s been the same season after season not matter how well the team are doing. The result tonight give Liverpool a glimmer of hope,' Carragher added.\u00a0Meanwhile, Micah Richards, who was a team-mate of Salah at Fiorentina during the 2014-15 campaign, says the 30-year-old was destined for greatness.\u00a0\u00a0'He was so focused. When he first came to training I knew he would be a super star. The way he used to press and the way he would look after himself,' Richards said.\u00a0",
        "'When he would get in front of goal he would finish it off. He was always going to score the goals. I just couldn\u2019t believe we had a player of such talent there. I couldn\u2019t believe none of the big clubs had taken him.\u00a0'Liverpool haven\u2019t played their best this season but his level hasn\u2019t dropped.'Since joining from Roma in 2017, Salah has scored 186 goals for Liverpool in 302 appearances while also providing 74 assists.\u00a0The win over Brentford\u00a0has put\u00a0Klopp's side a point behind fourth-placed Manchester United having played two games more.\u00a0"
