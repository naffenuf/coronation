        "Leicester boss Dean Smith believes Jamie Vardy can still flourish in the autumn of his career.",
        "The 36-year-old has returned to form in recent weeks, scoring in the last two games to help the Foxes out of the Premier League relegation zone, having previously gone 19 outings without a goal.The story of Vardy\u2019s ascent to the top of the game is well known and Smith believes that him not coming through the system in a traditional way can help him now.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t surprise me at all \u2013 this is someone who\u2019s scored 136 Premier League goals,\u201d Smith said of Vardy\u2019s resurgence ahead of Monday\u2019s vital clash with Fulham.\u201cYou don\u2019t lose that. I expected that (pace) to still be there.\u201cWhat I\u2019ve seen from him is the desire to still keep wanting it, from the runs he\u2019s making. His running numbers are really good from Monday night.",
        "\u201cHis story is synonymous with someone who came into the professional game a little bit later.\u201cSo he\u2019s probably not had all of those games before \u2013 at academy level for instance. So I don\u2019t see why he can\u2019t flourish in his later years.\u201dMuch was made of whether former boss Brendan Rodgers played to Vardy\u2019s strengths, something that Smith has seemed to do in the last few games.\u201cI didn\u2019t watch too many of the games to see if he was playing to his strengths,\u201d Smith added.",
        "\u201cHe didn\u2019t get as much pitch time as probably he would\u2019ve liked, but I wasn\u2019t here so I don\u2019t really know.\u201cShakey\u2019s (assistant boss Craig Shakespeare) worked with him before and knows him as a person and a player.\u201cI know him as a player who\u2019s been up against teams I\u2019ve managed before.\u201cHe\u2019s always a threat on the shoulder \u2013 just talking to their coaches after the game, they just tell their centre-halves to keep an eye on their shoulders, because he\u2019ll be on one of them, and he was.\u201d"
