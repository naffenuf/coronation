        "Manchester United\u2019s wretched record away to the Premier League\u2019s best continued with Thursday\u2019s late loss to Brighton.",
        "The Red Devils have failed to win any of their away games against the current top nine teams, drawing one and losing the other eight.Here, the PA news agency looks at that poor record as Erik ten Hag\u2019s first season in charge edges towards a conclusion.Brentford (currently 9th) 4 Manchester United 0 \u2013 August 13, 2022",
        "Ten Hag\u2019s first away match in charge ended in a 4-0 capitulation, with a mixture of catastrophic defensive ineptitude and Brentford opportunism meaning the Red Devils were four down at half-time. David De Gea gifted the first two to Josh Dasilva and Mathias Jensen, Ben Mee helped himself to a third and Bryan Mbeumo hit a slick fourth on a chastening afternoon for the visitors.Manchester City (currently 1st) 6 Manchester United 3 \u2013 October 2, 2022",
        "The phenomenal Erling Haaland and Phil Foden both scored hat-tricks in a Manchester derby humbling that evoked memories of City\u2019s famous 6-1 win at Old Trafford in 2011. Foden began the rout after just eight minutes and United were a distinct second best thereafter, although Antony pulled one back and Anthony Martial also claimed two consolation efforts.Aston Villa (currently 8th) 3 Manchester United 1 \u2013 November 6, 2022",
        "United fell to their first Premier League loss at Villa Park since 1995 in what proved to be Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s final match at the club. The Portuguese wore the armband in Birmingham, where the hosts ended a 9,941-day wait to beat the Red Devils in Unai Emery\u2019s first match in charge. Leon Bailey and Lucas Digne scored inside the opening 11 minutes, with Jacob Ramsey atoning for deflecting in a Luke Shaw strike by scoring a fine effort just after half-time.",
        "Arsenal (currently 2nd) 3 Manchester United 2 \u2013 January 22, 2023",
        "Eddie Nketiah flicked home a late winner as title-chasing Arsenal won a five-goal thriller in the capital. In-form Marcus Rashford scored a stunning opener that was cancelled out by Nketiah before Bukayo Saka\u2019s own top-drawer finish had Arsenal ahead. Lisandro Martinez, an Arsenal target last summer, levelled but Nketiah would turn home a wayward Martin Odegaard shot to secure a memorable win.Liverpool (currently 5th) 7 Manchester United 0 \u2013 March 5, 2023",
        "Ten Hag fumed at his side\u2019s \u201cunprofessional\u201d display in a loss that equalled United\u2019s record competitive defeat \u2013 against Blackburn in 1926, Aston Villa in 1930 and Wolves in 1931. Just a week on from lifting the Carabao Cup, the Old Trafford giants were brought back down to earth with a bump at Anfield. Cody Gakpo\u2019s smart strike had Liverpool ahead at the break and nobody could have foreseen the way United would unravel. Gakpo, Darwin Nunez and Mohamed Salah ended the day with two goals apiece, with substitute Roberto Firmino completing a win that will live long in the memory of both clubs.Newcastle (currently 3rd) 2 Manchester United 0 \u2013 April 2, 2023",
        "The loss to Liverpool was called \u201cunprofessional\u201d and United defender Luke Shaw labelled the defeat at St James\u2019 Park \u201cunacceptable\u201d. Boss Ten Hag agreed with the left-back\u2019s assessment that the Magpies were \u201cmore determined, more passionate\u201d and had \u201cmore desire\u201d as Joe Willock and substitute Callum Wilson secured the hosts a win that was more one-sided than the scoreline suggested.",
        "Tottenham (currently 7th) 2 Manchester United 2 \u2013 April 27, 2023",
        "United last week blew a two-goal lead against a Spurs side playing their first match since replacing interim Cristian Stellini with another caretaker boss in the wake of their 6-1 trouncing at Newcastle. First-half efforts by Jadon Sancho and Rashford put United in cruise control, only for Ryan Mason\u2019s half-time message to do the trick. Pedro Porro reduced the deficit and Son Heung-min levelled.Brighton (currently 6th) 1 Manchester United 0 \u2013 May 4, 2023",
        "Ten Hag bemoaned Thursday\u2019s \u201cannoying\u201d last-gasp loss at Brighton, where Alexis Mac Allister slammed home from the penalty spot in the ninth minute of added time after Shaw\u2019s inexplicable handball was punished following VAR intervention. Ten Hag conceded his side contributed to their own downfall during a pulsating south-coast clash."
