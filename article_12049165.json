        "Suella Braverman\u2019s rhetoric on illegal migration is \u201cdamaging to our communities\u201d and \u201cfeeds into the far right\u201d, a Tory former minister has warned.",
        "Rehman Chishti urged the Home Secretary to \u201cget on and do her job\u201d but shied away from calling for her to resign insisting \u201cit\u2019s up to the Prime Minister\u201d.Mr Chishti was speaking from the counting hall in Gillingham, Kent, where Labour is looking to take the council, Medway, despite having been in the hands of the Conservatives since 2003.",
        "The Gillingham and Rainham MP told Sky News he was \u201cconfident\u201d the Conservatives will be able to maintain their current seats.He was later asked whether he was worried Ms Braverman\u2019s rhetoric on illegal migration might have had an impact on voters in the local elections.Mr Chishti wrote a column in the Observer newspaper at the end of April, titled \u201ccalling out Braverman\u2019s views on race and abuse is a vital part of my Conservative values\u201d, in which he argued the Home Secretary was \u201cemboldening the far right by pointing the finger at ethnic groups\u201d.The Tory MP said: \u201cI think you know, from my many appearances on Sky News, people know that I say what I think and I\u2019m a man of principle, and I think I stand by everything I wrote in that paper.",
        "\u201cI\u2019ve sat on the Home Affairs Select Committee for three years looking at security and the comments that we had from the Home Secretary, the rhetoric that she applies to certain faiths and diverse communities is damaging to our communities and also it damages the community relations, it feeds into the far right.",
        "\u201cSo what I would say to the Home Secretary she needs to get on, and do her job, address the big issues of the day.\u201dHe insisted the biggest illegal migration issue is \u201cwith regards to people who come into this country, overstay on their visas\u201d, adding: \u201cSo the Home Secretary needs to get on, make sure that people who are here illegally are removed quickly and swiftly and does her job rather than applying rhetoric which damages our communities.\u201dOn whether he thought Rishi Sunak should sack Ms Braverman, Mr Chishti replied: \u201cI think it\u2019s up to the Prime Minister who he selected to be his Cabinet.\u201d"
