        "Sean Dyche believes Everton\u2019s performance in Monday\u2019s 2-2 draw at Leicester has brought the \u201cfeel-good factor\u201d back to the squad, even if it did not result in three badly-needed points in their fight against relegation.",
        "Everton remain winless in their last seven games having come from behind to rescue a point at the King Power Stadium, but Dyche was keen to take the positives from a performance in which his side had 23 shots at goal, their most in a Premier League fixture for three and a half years.As they prepare for another Monday away match \u2013 this time a much tougher looking fixture at high-flying Brighton \u2013 Dyche said the Leicester game had given his players a confidence boost.\u201cThe Leicester performance was a mixture of what we want,\u201d he said. \u201cGood energy and good detail, apart from the mistakes from the goals. We looked a real threat constantly and I was pleased with the team performance.\u201cIt reaffirms to them that we are on the right track. I know we aren\u2019t in the league and the table, but in the performances we are.\u201cWe didn\u2019t get the full reward for it but we did get the reward of the feel-good factor and rightly so. It\u2019s not easy going on the road in the Premier League.\u201d",
        "Everton won three of Dyche\u2019s first seven games in charge but are now winless since the 1-0 victory over Brentford on March 11, since when they have taken four points from the last seven.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s a quality of performance that we want to build,\u201d Dyche said. \u201cWe have done that in certain games, particularly against Arsenal when we first got here. It shows it is in there \u2013 it\u2019s the consistency I\u2019ve been searching for.\u201dFinding that consistency has been a key theme that Dyche has emphasised to his players this week.\u201cThe thing is, it\u2019s parked really quickly,\u201d he added of the Leicester performance. \u201cWe have to use it wisely, but then you have to go and deliver it again.\u201cIt can\u2019t be once every few games, it has to be consistent. That is what I have been talking about on the training pitch and what I have been talking about through the media about our performances.\u201dEverton go into the weekend stuck in 19th position, albeit only one point behind the three teams above them. Leeds head to Manchester City on Saturday while Leicester and Nottingham Forest are, like Everton, both in action on Monday.\u201cLike everyone in the Premier League, when you\u2019re down, looking up, everything seems different and we have to make sure we take away that feeling and focus on our performance like we did at Leicester,\u201d Dyche said.\u201cThat was about us, that wasn\u2019t about Leicester. That is a thing we have been trying to get the players to really grasp \u2013 to grip hold of games, but it\u2019s not easy when you\u2019re playing against top sides.\u201d"
