        "Ms Hanbury, who is the Marchioness of Cholmondeley via her marriage to her aristocratic husband David Cholmondeley, wore a striking black and white ankle-length vintage dress by Ozzie Clark, similar to the smart white fitted dress and black belt that the Princess of Wales wore on The Mall yesterday afternoon.The 39-year-old aristocrat also donned a pair of\u00a0towering black \u00a3490\u00a0Bow Tie Pump 105 Aquazzura heels. Kate, 41, wore the same shoe during yesterday's walkabout with\u00a0Prince William and the King ahead of the Realm Governors General and Prime Ministers Lunch at Buckingham Palace.Clearly popular in royal circles and high society, the same bow tie heel was also often worn by the Duchess of Sussex during her time as a working royal.\u00a0",
        "When it came to the Marchioness of Cholmondeley's dress, although it was very similar in colour scheme to the smart white dress which Kate wore yesterday, the aristocrat opted for a very rare vintage designer frock.Ms Hanbury wore an Ossie Clark designer crepe wrap dress by Quorum, which dates back to 1970.\u00a0The Cholmondeleys\u2019 home is Houghton Hall, a stunning Palladian mansion built in the 1720s for Britain\u2019s first Prime Minister, Sir Robert Walpole. The 106-room pile is in North Norfolk.\u00a0",
        "On Friday,\u00a0Kate Middleton appeared to make a subtle nod to her sister-in-law the Duchess of Sussex\u00a0as she stepped out in a pair of Meghan Markle's favourite heels.",
        "The Duchess wore the Bow Tie Pump 105 black heels, which feature a flirty bow, for her first ever solo royal engagement, as well as a number of other occasions.Meghan\u2019s Aquazzura obsession began long before meeting her prince. Aquazzura, founded in 2012, was not a household name when Meghan started wearing the shoes.\u00a0For her engagement photocall, she wore the label\u2019s \u00a3490 suede Matilde heels, and white Aquazzuras for the evening reception at her wedding.And while it's not the first time the Princess of Wales has worn the brand, it's certainly the first time she has stepped out in the black\u00a0Bow Tie Pump 105 heels, which Meghan wore a number of times during her time in the royal family.\u00a0"
