        "Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp insists the club will not be held to ransom over transfer targets and are not prepared to pay over-inflated prices.",
        "The club have already pulled out of the running for their primary option Jude Bellingham with Borussia Dortmund likely to ask for a fee around \u00a3130million.With a midfield rebuild required it was decided to spread their limited resources wider rather than going for a megabucks marquee signing, with Brighton\u2019s Alexis Mac Allister near the top of their alternatives.Liverpool\u2019s issues in midfield could lead to selling clubs upping the price knowing the rival\u2019s need to sign players and, more specifically, secure them early in the summer.",
        "But Klopp said they were not prepared to pay over the odds and have a list of targets which he feels provides the club with options if they should encounter a stumbling block in negotiations.\u201cWe cannot buy the player then. If they are overpriced we cannot do it,\u201d he said.\u201cI am pretty sure we will bring in the players we want and those who will help us. I am pretty confident of that.\u201cYou never know 100 per cent until they are signed but that (bumping up prices) is not new that some clubs might try that.\u201cLet me say it like this: you identify a position and you have not only one option on the position. That means they should all be good.",
        "\u201cYou might have a favourite but if the other club doesn\u2019t want to sell or someone else will pay the price then we cannot go with it.\u201cBut usually we got the players we wanted. The one thing is can we afford them and then they are here.\u201dLiverpool\u2019s five-match winning run, lifting them to within four points of fourth-placed Manchester United but with only an outside chance of making the top four because their rivals have played two matches fewer, has put a better spin on a season which had the club lingering between eighth and 10th for long periods.Klopp knows he cannot \u201creplace the whole team\u201d with his summer transfers but does not believe their final league position will have much effect on the success of the business he does, although he thinks it may be of assistance to the players he currently has.\u201cEach performance we have now helps us and helps the players,\u201d he added.\u201cWe cannot replace the whole team. How I understand life is if you have a problem you sort it better now because if you just move on you have the same problem. You might have a favourite but if the other club doesn\u2019t want to sell or someone else will pay the price then we cannot go with it  Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp on transfers  ",
        "\u201cWe have to give the boys a frame where they can perform because I see them every day, I know they want to perform.\u201cIt is not that they say \u2018I cannot do that anymore\u2019. We were not able to do it that is true for a long period, but we will find a frame where the boys can shine again.\u201cEverything we do well now will help us for next season. These five games I liked the reaction in moments, it is not full games, but the signs I saw are really promising and I am happy with that.\u201cAnother four games, a break, then a proper pre-season and we will be strong.\u201d"
