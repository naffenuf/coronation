        "Earlier today, the King and the Prince and Princess of Wales thrilled royal fans at The Mall as they made a surprise appearance to greet well-wishers less than 24 hours before the coronation.The road leading to Buckingham Palace was cleared and royal fans eagerly lined the route, having likely figured out that they may well catch a glimpse of the new King due to the security and media presence.People cheered and could be heard shouting 'God Save the King' as the senior figures of the monarchy arrived to shake hands with well-wishers.\u00a0Royal superfans were left blown away by the visit, which came just hours after a downpour soaked thousands of people camped out at The Mall, with one person telling Sky News: 'This is the happiest moment in my life.'",
        "The King went to one side of The Mall while William and Kate went to another to greet well-wishers. One woman told Charles 'Love you Charlie' while others passed on their congratulations to him.Kate and William posed for selfies with fans, while Kate even appeared to join one person in a video call before also speaking on another fan's phone before handing it back.\u00a0This morning the King took part in a final coronation rehearsal at Westminster Abbey, where a 2,300-strong congregation, and a television audience likely to be in the tens of millions, will watch him being crowned on Saturday.\u00a0",
        "As excitement ramps for Britain's first coronation in 70 years, Charles and Kate joined a lunch for VIPs at Buckingham Palace.His Majesty was joined by working royals at a special event for prime ministers and governors general at the Palace from midday, just after the heavens opened on London.",
        "The Prince and Princess of Wales, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh, the Princess Royal and Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence were at the event. Completing the royal contingent were the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester and the Duke of Kent. But there was no invite for Prince Andrew, who was seen driving around Windsor this lunchtime.\u00a0",
        "There were 42 attendees in total, including UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, Australia's republican Prime Minister\u00a0Anthony Albanese, and Prime Minister of New Zealand Chris Hipkins.\u00a0Charles, Queen Consort Camilla and Prince William had been at Westminster Abbey this morning for final rehearsals ahead of the Coronation tomorrow, around the time\u00a0Prince Harry may have landed in the UK.\u00a0His Majesty and his wife waved to crowds as he was driven down The Mall to the church for further preparations, before a run of diplomatic duties including hosting a\u00a0Buckingham Palace\u00a0lunch for VIPs.\u00a0But the monarch looked shocked by the heavy rain as he passed thousands of people who are camped out along the route from the Abbey to the Palace including the packed Mall, dubbed\u00a0Chaztonbury due to the huge numbers camped out there.",
        "Meanwhile Prince Harry may have already landed in the UK for his 24-hour visit for the Coronation - leaving his wife and two children at home.The Duke of Sussex is intending to fly back to California straight after the historic ceremony ends tomorrow afternoon so he can make it back to see Archie on his fourth birthday.This morning a private jet from Van Nuys airport in California landed at Farnborough, the airport closest to Windsor Castle. Van Nuys is just an hour from Harry and Meghan's Montecito mansion, but it is not yet known if he was on board.",
        "Some 100 heads of state are descending on London for the coronation on Saturday, with representatives from 203 countries due to attend.\u00a0Japan's Crown Prince Akishino and Crown Princess Kiko were among those checking in at their London hotel this morning.The final preparations come as broadcaster Jonathan Dimbleby, a friend of Charles who wrote his authorised biography, said the monarch would find the Homage of the People 'abhorrent'.For the first time, those watching the coronation ceremony will be invited to make their own homage to Charles, replacing the traditional homage of peers, but some commentators have criticised the new element as divisive.",
        "Mr Dimbleby told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I can think of nothing that he would find more abhorrent. He's never wanted to be revered, he's never wanted - so as far as I know - to have anyone pay homage to him except in mock terms as a joke.",
        "'He wants, I think, to feel that people will share in the event and I don't quite know how this might have happened.'Meanwhile, those travelling across the UK on public transport are being reminded to 'mind the gap' by the King.Charles and Camilla have recorded an announcement which is being played between Friday and Monday at every railway station across the UK and all London Underground stations, industry body the Rail Delivery Group said.In the message, the King begins by telling passengers: 'My wife and I wish you and your families a wonderful coronation weekend.'Camilla then says: 'Wherever you are travelling, we hope you have a safe and pleasant journey.'The message concludes with Charles adding: 'And remember, please mind the gap.'It was recorded at Highgrove earlier this year by the audio team from Transport for London."
