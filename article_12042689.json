        "British woman took to Mumsnet as she spoke about getting the ick from partnerRead More:\u00a0Single women share the dating 'icks' they can't STAND about menA women revealed that her partner has given her the ick because he drinks fizzy drinks all day.",
        "Taking to parenting platform Mumsnet, the British mother explained that she feels\u00a0embarrassed watching him slug bottles of fizzy drinks all day.She claimed he also pulls a weird face at the mention of vegetables and eats sweets and chocolate constantly, despite being almost 40 years old.\u00a0The woman asked others if she was\u00a0just blowing it out of proportion as he has only been her partner for five months.\u00a0However many rushed to the comments saying it would also give them the ick as he is acting like a 'teenage boy.'",
        "The woman explained: 'To have gotten the ick with my partner over his drinking habits?'So this is likely a me problem as I have mild OCD and often get irritated at small things that I know aren\u2019t a real problem, I never say anything because I know it\u2019s my issue not theirs.\u00a0'Looking for some perspective on this one though because it\u2019s really putting me off my newish partner (of five months).'He has a lot of good points but the fact that he drinks soft drinks/fizzy pop all day long out of the bottle is really putting me off.\u00a0'I can\u2019t even articulate why, it sort of feels embarrassing somehow? He also pulls his face at veg and eats sweets and chocolate constantly, he\u2019s not overweight though.",
        "'I haven\u2019t said anything and just tried to put it out of my mind because I don\u2019t trust my own judgment on what\u2019s annoying and what isn\u2019t, but today we went for a day out together and he pulled a 2 litre bottle of Coca Cola out of his bag and started drinking from it in public.\u00a0'I felt sick and mortified, I didn\u2019t want to be seen with him and I said I had a headache so that we could leave early.",
        "'Would that really put you off a partner or is my mind just blowing it out of proportion?'Many women suggested she should break up with the block as it was a big turn off for them too.\u00a0One person wrote: 'I'd hate that, I'm imagining other gross habits will reveal themselves in time. Move on!'Another said: 'Sounds chavvy to me. Not exactly a classy gentleman. If it's bothering you then end it sooner rather than later.'Someone else wrote: 'It would be like dating a teenage boy who has just been given his pocket money.\u00a0'Think what his teeth will be like. He'd also be full of gas and I wouldn't stick around for the explosion!'",
        "While a fourth wrote: 'Yanbu, it screams immaturity which would be a huge turn off for me.'",
        "The original poster added: 'Thanks all, good to know that it\u2019s not just me. I think you\u2019re all right that it seems childish, it somehow makes me think of a teenager holed up in their pigsty of a room gaming until 5am so I think that\u2019s what unsettles me.\u00a0'He\u2019s almost 40 though so I think he\u2019s past the point of outgrowing it by now.'However others suggested the use of the term 'ick' is more off putting them someone drinking fizzy drinks.\u00a0",
        "One person wrote: 'I also find an adult saying \u201cgotten the ick\u201d more annoying than drinking fizzy drinks.'I initially assumed you meant he had an individual sized bottle of Diet Coke or whatever and to be honest, no I wouldn\u2019t find that particularly odd or offensive. It is very odd that he carries a 2 litre bottle around though and yes I dare say I would be embarrassed if my husband carried a bottle that size around with him.'Another wrote: 'I don't care what someone eats or drinks but I couldn't be with an adult who used the phrase \"gotten the ick\".\u00a0"
