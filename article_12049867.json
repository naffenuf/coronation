        "Cameron Turgay Bardak sentenced to 14 years in prison\u00a0He attacked ex-girlfriend Maria Buci with a hatchet in July 2020A gym junkie who tried to kill his ex-girlfriend with an axe as she left work has been jailed for 14 years after being found guilty of attempted murder.",
        "Former Government House security guard, Cameron Turgay Bardak, 32, attacked his former partner, Maria Buci, as she left the office in Brisbane's CBD on July 1, 2020.Bardak hid behind a pillar in a car park near Ms Buci's vehicle before approaching and threatening to kill her. He then struck her with a hatchet and strangled her.A good samaritan who was passing by on an electric scooter,\u00a0David Sturgess, quickly stepped in to stop the attack and managed to wrestle the hatchet off Bardak.Bardak was on Friday sentenced to 14 years behind bars for attempted murder, and three years in jail for wounding Mr Sturgess, both which will be served concurrently.",
        "Speaking outside of the Brisbane Supreme Court on Thursday, Ms Buci thanked the good samaritans who stepped in to save her life.\u00a0'They are the reason I am alive today,' she said.A Brisbane Supreme Court jury had been shown iPhone footage of Bardak on top of Ms Buci with his hands around her throat while multiple people tried to separate them.Ms Buci became emotional upon hearing the jury's guilty verdict on Thursday.'I do just want to thank everyone who has been by my side and has assisted me these past three years - the police service, the DPP, the witnesses and everyone who saved me that night,' Ms Buci said outside court.",
        "'I am very grateful.'Bardak had pleaded guilty to an alternate charge of causing grievous bodily harm to Ms Buci, whose hand and finger were struck by the hatchet.She had a clump of hair pulled out and her throat was also injured during the attack, the court was told.However, crown prosecutor Chris Cook did not accept his plea, telling the jury that Bardak had formed the idea that 'if I can't have her, nobody will'.Ms Buci had told the jury that she was choked three times as she tried to flee her ex-boyfriend's hatchet attack.She said the assault had left her with physical scars and she was 'still messed up mentally'.Ms Buci said she was walking through the car park and spotted Bardak hiding behind a concrete pillar next to her vehicle.He told her to 'get in the car'.'He said ''I'm going to kill you'' and that's when I saw the axe. Then I started screaming and he pushed me against the wall,' she told the jury.",
        "Ms Buci said Bardak hit her with the axe, causing her to fall down before striking her again while her hands were covering her head.He then started choking her.The trial heard workers from nearby offices rushed into the car park after hearing cries for help.",
        "One witness was struck in the hand by the hatchet but was able to punch Bardak in the head and kidneys in an attempt to stop the attack, to no avail.Others from neighbouring buildings ran to the scene and helped loosen Bardak's grip, allowing Ms Buci to flee but he chased her down.Multiple people were then able to free her a second time, the court was told.Ms Buci on Thursday agreed that the good Samaritans were 'heroic'.'Absolutely. What they did you don't see it every day and I hope they don't have to see it ever again,' she told media.After Bardak's sentencing on Friday, Ms Buci revealed she now struggles with nightmares, intimacy and has trust issues with men.She required a colleague to walk her to and from her office in the wake of the attack and has since packed her bags and moved overseas.'My life will go on, but it will not be the life I planned for myself as I am not the person I once was,' she told the court, the Courier Mail reported.'The person I knew died \u2013 not physically, but mentally and emotionally.'I have lost all independence as a human being and as a woman.'Bardak told the court that he only bought a hatchet to force her into speaking to him again.",
        "The jury reached a verdict after they started deliberating on Wednesday morning.Bardak must serve 11 years before he's eligible for parole.He has already spent three years behind bars which will count as time served."
