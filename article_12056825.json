        "The former couple were reported to have split up that same month, and a source told People\u00a0that Jenner 'is not with Travis right now.'\u00a0The insider went on to speak about the main differences between the rapper and the entrepreneur.They stated: 'Kylie is very focused on her kids and her business. She is not a big partier. Travis is the opposite. He likes to party. They definitely have different focuses. They always did.'\u00a0",
        "The source then expressed that Scott and Jenner had maintained a turbulent relationship over the past five years.'There is a reason that they never got married. It's always been very up and down. And they have never even lived together. They have always had separate homes,' they said.However, the source added that the pair were used to maintaining an on-off romance and could potentially reconcile in the near future.\u00a0'They have split several times in the past and this is probably not the end of their relationship,' they said.Jenner was originally linked to Chalamet, 27, last month.

It's not serious, but Kylie is enjoying hanging out with Timothee and seeing where it goes.'",
        "The source went on to state that the social media personality was thoroughly enjoying her time with the Dune star.'It's been really fun for her because it feels a lot different than her past relationships. It's new and exciting for Kylie and she's having a lot of fun.'\u00a0They added: 'Timothee is also friends with Kendall [Jenner] so it's been easy for Kylie to integrate him into her life.'\u00a0Neither Jenner nor Chalamet have made any public comments about their relationship as of yet.\u00a0"
