        "Fulham manager Marco Silva claims the award of Liverpool\u2019s match-winning penalty was embarrassing as his side slipped to an eighth defeat in 10 games.",
        "Mohamed Salah scored from the spot for the second successive match to secure a 1-0 win after Issa Diop was adjudged to have brought down Darwin Nunez.Silva was not convinced, however, saying: \u201cThe way they scored the goal, I have to say that is embarrassing.\u201cToday in football to give a penalty like that, after the VAR didn\u2019t take that penalty (away) it is difficult to understand.",
        "\u201cI will not say nothing more because after it will be difficult for me and I don\u2019t want to create more problems for me. It is difficult to understand that penalty,\u201d Silva said.\u201cWhen Darwin touch the ball he start to dive himself but after he touched his left leg with Issa.\u201cThey are going to say it is harsh but the referee gave and after the VAR cannot take (away). It is always the same conversation. I didn\u2019t speak with the referee at the end or at half-time. I had some words with the fourth official.\u201cIssa told me that it is clear not penalty. The referee made a mistake and the VAR is there to take that decision and not allow the penalty to go on. That\u2019s clear for me.\u201d",
        "The victory secured a fifth successive win for Liverpool for the first time since April 2022 and maintained the pressure on fourth-placed Manchester United, whom they trail by four points having played two matches more.",
        "\u201cReally pleased with big parts of the game: first half controlling, creating not finishing situations off,\u201d said manager Jurgen Klopp.\u201cThe penalty I like a lot because it a counter-pressing situation; Darwin is fully in the situation and gets a pen and Mo finishes it off.\u201cWe then don\u2019t close the game early and we have to fight to the end and we needed Ali (Alisson Becker) obviously, the save from (Carlos) Vinicius was sensational and he was happy about the clean sheet more than anyone.\u201cFive wins in a row is super-difficult. It felt it was ages ago we did it and the more I like it.\u201d"
