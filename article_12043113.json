        "She expressed that she has been able to connect with other women who have had similar experiences and that\u00a0she hopes her book will help others.",
        "'I want people to feel seen. I want people to get more comfortable with the idea of grace and forgiveness. Grace is not for people you might necessarily think deserve it, that's why it's called \"grace.\"'\u00a0Minka also details her 'toxic' relationship with her then Friday Night Light co-star,\u00a0Taylor Kitsch, in excerpts per The Daily Beast. The two not only had an on-screen relationship, but were also together in real-life.\u00a0She explained that her focus on set revolved around Taylor rather than other castmates, and stated, 'So when my relationship with Taylor became toxic, I had no one to turn to.'\u00a0Kelly admitted that she had 'shacked up'\u00a0with her co-star, although a producer on the show, Peter Berg, had warned her to do otherwise.The actress explained that both she and the actor had broken up and gotten back together 'more times than [she] [could] count.'",
        "She also added, 'Life became very difficult both on and off set whenever we broke up. We were young and had very few tools to handle our emotions and personal grievances.'Minka recalled when she was not dating Taylor, the two couldn't use the same trailers on set and also 'couldn't ride in the same van together...' The beauty added that Kitsch was more\u00a0open about his 'feelings' with other castmates than she was.\u00a0",
        "'My co-workers weren\u2019t taking me out for drinks after work to mend my broken heart,' and added that, 'they were taking him out.'Minka had starred on the series for the first three seasons, and only briefly appeared in the fourth season. Taylor, on the other hand, remained on the series for five seasons.",
        "Later on Wednesday, the actress had a second outfit change and donned a chic, brown suit that comprised of loose-fitting slacks and a matching blazer that she chose to leave unbuttoned.\u00a0The beauty chose to wear a plain, white shirt underneath that added a bit of contrast to the overall look as she exited ABC Studios in the heart of New York City.\u00a0She slipped into the same tan-colored heels that she had worn earlier in the day which perfectly coincided with the color scheme of her ensemble.\u00a0Minka was seen flashing a small smile as she greeted fans as she prepared to head to the next destination during her busy schedule.\u00a0\u00a0"
