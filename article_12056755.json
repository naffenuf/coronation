        "The Claret's boss was also recently named Championship manager of the season, beating Micheal Carrick to the award, which is no mean feat considering the excellent work the former Manchester United midfielder has done at Middlesbrough.But the news will come as a blow to Spurs who had reportedly added the former City defender to their shortlist of managers to take over from Antonio Conte.\u00a0",
        "Speaking on Kompany's contract renewal, Clarets chairman Alan Pace added: 'We are ecstatic Vincent has signed a new deal!'He is the perfect fit for how we all see Burnley Football Club moving forward.'An extraordinary leader, setting ever higher standards and driving our club to the levels we all want to achieve.'The Clarets will now wrap up their season, presenting the Championship trophy to a sell-out crowd at Turf Moor as their side take on Cardiff on Monday night.\u00a0"
