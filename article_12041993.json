        "For the late Queen Elizabeth II's coronation in 1953, Coronation Chicken \u2013 cold chicken in a curry cream sauce with a well-seasoned dressed salad of rice, green peas and mixed herbs \u2013 was invented to feed the foreign guests who were entertained at Buckingham Palace after the ceremony.The recipe is by royal head chef Mark Flanagan and was chosen by Charles and Camilla in collaboration with him.Former Buckingham Palace chef Darren McGrady said the King's choice came as no surprise because Charles loves anything with eggs and cheese.Buckingham Palace said the quiche was chosen because it worked as a sharing dish, can be served hot or cold, suits a wide variety of dietary requirements and can be easily adapted to suit different tastes.",
