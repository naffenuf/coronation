He left the building about nine minutes after entering.Nearly two hours later, police body camera footage showed Wise berating police officers outside the Capitol and repeatedly shouting, \"Shame on you!\"\"You guys are disgusting,\" he told them. \"I\u00b4m former law enforcement. You\u00b4re disgusting. You are the Nazi. You are the Gestapo. You can\u00b4t see it.\"",
