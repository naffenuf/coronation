        "A number of events in Wales have already been cancelled, including an outdoor screening of the coronation at Friars Walk shopping centre in Newport.Another is at Caldicot Castle in Monmouthshire, after organisers failed to raise \u00a33,000 to cover costs.In an online post, Caldicot Town Team said a crowdfunding page had been running for 16 days, but despite being promoted on social media it had \u201cfailed to raise any money whatsoever\u201d.",
        "A coronation party in Caldicot\u2019s town centre was also cancelled after organisers failed to raise the funds needed to cover costs amid a \u201clack of interest\u201d from the community.A \u201cNot My King\u201d protest will take place in Cardiff, with organisers Cymru Republic asking people to gather by the statue of Aneurin Bevan in Queen Street from 12.30pm.",
        "They will march through the streets before heading to Bute Park stone circle for a Big Republican Lunch.It will coincide with similar anti-monarchy protests expected to take place across the UK during the coronation.One of the organisers, Welsh politician Bethan Sayed, said: \u201cThis is not just about attending a protest, it\u2019s about starting a conversation with people in Wales about what the royal family is, what the monarchy represents, and what we could do differently in Wales should we want to.\u201cThe crux of it is that we don\u2019t believe there should be the institution of a monarchy in our democracy and we want to look at growing within the 21st century to have a system where young people are treated on an equal basis and people are not left in poverty or have to be subjects of a family that are born into their position.\u201dMs Sayed led a similar protest during Charles\u2019s last visit to Wales after his accession to the throne, which is said to have attracted around 500 people and made international headlines.",
        "She said the group had not received letters from the Home Office \u2013 as the organisers of London\u2019s planned protest, Republic, did last week \u2013 but said they had been in communication with South Wales Police.",
        "Chris Truscott, the force\u2019s chief superintendent said: \u201cOfficers will be on patrol across South Wales this weekend to ensure that our communities can enjoy the coronation bank holiday safely.\u201cWe are aware of a demonstration which is planned to take place in Cardiff city centre on Saturday and officers will be on duty to facilitate a peaceful demonstration and minimise disruption to the wider community.\u201dOver the last week, a Royal Mail postbox in Cardiff that was decorated in Union flag colours in celebration of the King\u2019s crowning has been vandalised with republican and Welsh independence stickers.Complaints were made and the stickers have been moved, but the the location of the box \u2013 one of four around the UK \u2013 has drawn criticism as it is outside the historic Owain Glyndwr pub in St John Street.Glyndwr was a Welsh hero who fought against English rule in the late Middle Ages. His 15-year revolt means he is often referred to as \u201cthe last Prince of Wales\u201d and is seen as a symbol of Welsh nationalism.",
        "Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford will attend the service in Westminster alongside world leaders, but the country\u2019s Llywydd \u2013 speaker of the Senedd \u2013 Elin Jones declined the invite saying \u201cas a republic\u201d it was \u201cfor others to celebrate a coronation\u201d."
