King, country and Commonwealth.\u201dBy publicly calling Charles \u201cPa\u201d and expressing the royal family\u2019s pride in him, he echoed the speeches his father gave at the late Queen\u2019s successive Jubilee concerts, when he referred to her as \u201cMummy\u201d.",

A huge thank you to everyone for making this such a special evening.\u201cI want to say a few words about my father, and why I believe this weekend is so important.\u201cBut don\u2019t worry, unlike Lionel, I won\u2019t go on all night long.\u201d",
        "Speaking of the late Queen, he said: \u201cAs my grandmother said when she was crowned, coronations are a declaration of our hopes for the future.\u201cAnd I know she\u2019s up there, fondly keeping an eye on us. And she would be a very proud mother.\u201cFor all that celebrations are magnificent, at the heart of the pageantry is a simple message. Service.\u201d",
        "He described how his father\u2019s first words on entering Westminster Abbey for his coronation \u2013 when he responded to the official greeting by a young chorister \u2013 were a pledge of service.\u201cIt was a pledge to continue to serve,\u201d William said.\u201cBecause for over 50 years, in every corner of the UK, across the Commonwealth and around the world, he has dedicated himself to serve others, both current and future generations, and those whose memory must not be neglected.\u201dHe praised the King\u2019s take on the natural world, saying: \u201cHe warned us of the risks to our planet\u2019s health long before it was an everyday issue.\u201d",

Your service inspires us. And tonight we celebrate you too.\u201cI commit myself to serve you all. King, country and Commonwealth. God save the King!\u201d"
