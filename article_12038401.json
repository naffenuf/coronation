        "First Minister Humza Yousaf should have ordered police to have a \u201cstandoff\u201d at Edinburgh Castle to stop the Stone of Destiny being taken to Westminster, Alex Salmond has said.",
        "The stone was taken to London last week to be used in the coronation of the King this weekend, as it has been used for centuries, but the former first minister said it could have been used to barter for another referendum on Scottish independence.Speaking to Andrew Marr on LBC on Tuesday, Mr Salmond said there should have been a \u201cring of policemen around Edinburgh Castle\u201d, claiming that such a show of force would have \u201ccommanded worldwide attention\u201d.The Alba Party leader, now an outspoken critic of the SNP \u2013 the party he led for two decades \u2013 also announced he would not attend the coronation, but instead speak at a pro-independence march in Glasgow on Saturday.",
        "\u201cThe opportunity was there to make a simple statement in defence of the country and the realm,\u201d he said.\u201cAnd I\u2019m sure it would have commanded worldwide attention \u2013 you don\u2019t command very much as First Minister of Scotland, but you do command the Scottish police force, you could have put a ring of policemen around Edinburgh Castle.\u201cHave a standoff on the Esplanade and politely explain to the world that Scotland should not sacrifice its symbol of sovereignty until that sovereignty is at least recognised by Westminster.\u201dPolice Scotland is operationally independent of the Scottish Government, meaning it cannot be directed by the First Minister.",
        " I'm going to be at the Glasgow march and speaking on independence  Alex Salmond, Alba Party  He added: \u201cIt would be, politically, an important gesture to bring to worldwide attention the plight that Scotland is now in.\u201cAs First Minister you don\u2019t have many political cards to play when you\u2019ve got an obdurate Westminster Government saying you\u2019re not going to be able to exercise your democratic rights, so when you\u2019re presented with this amazing opportunity, then your duty, your absolute duty much greater than your duty to the monarch, your duty to the people, is to use that and to try and use it in Scotland\u2019s benefit.\u201dMr Salmond went on to describe the First Minster as looking like a \u201cpet poodle\u201d as he saw the stone off on its journey to London.Asked if he would be attending the coronation, Mr Salmond said he would be attending an event organised by independence group All Under One Banner in Glasgow.\u201cI know I\u2019m criticising Humza Yousaf for not seizing the opportunity that the symbolism of the Stone of Destiny is, I\u2019m not particularly criticising him for going to the coronation, I don\u2019t think he should have said to people he was going to the independent march,\u201d he said.\u201cThat\u2019s where I\u2019m going to be. I\u2019m going to be there and speaking on independence.",
        "\u201cBut I can\u2019t understand the attraction of other key members of the SNP who got invitations to attend to attend a ceremony in London, when they should be attending an independence march in Glasgow.\u201dHe went on to say he believed Charles would be \u201cthe last king of Scots\u201d."
