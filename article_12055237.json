        "Nottingham Forest boss Steve Cooper switches off from the stress of the Premier League relegation battle by going running along the River Trent.",
        "Forest are embroiled in a fight to retain their top-flight status in their first season back after 23 years away, with Monday\u2019s clash against Southampton likely to be decisive in their bid to beat the drop.Cooper has had plenty thrown at him this term, with concerns over keeping his job, a lengthy injury list and having to integrate 30 new signings into his squad, but the phone-free jogs along the river have been helpful.\u201cThe thing I like to do is a lot of running,\u201d he said.\u201cI enjoy it. I don\u2019t take my phone with me. I\u2019m not a big user of my phone anyway. The two places I definitely don\u2019t have it are out on the training pitch and if I want to go for a run.\u201cIt\u2019s something where you can take your mind to where you want it to be and I\u2019m sure there\u2019s quite a few people who do the same.",
        "\u201cI make a lot of decisions when I\u2019m out running. I think about a lot of things. It\u2019s even good when you feel frustrated or stress.\u201cWhatever I\u2019m feeling before a run, I feel better for it afterwards.\u201cI run along the river a lot. It\u2019s lovely along there, especially when you\u2019re running towards the City Ground.\u201d"
