        "Brazil\u2019s Federal Police have searched former president Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s home and seized his phone in what they said was an investigation into alleged falsification of Covid-19 vaccine cards.",
        "Several other locations were also searched and six people faced arrest, police said.The former president confirmed the search on his residence while speaking with reporters, as did his wife Michelle on her Instagram account. She said her phone was not seized, contrary to media reports.A federal police official said Bolsonaro will be deposed at Federal Police headquarters and confirmed that one of his closest allies, Mauro Cid, was arrested.Asked about the search of Bolsonaro\u2019s home, the Federal Police\u2019s press office said officers were carrying out 16 searches and six arrests in Rio de Janeiro related to the introduction of fraudulent data related to the Covid-19 vaccine into the nation\u2019s health system. The statement did not name Bolsonaro or Cid.Local media reported that the vaccine cards of Bolsonaro, his advisers and his family members were altered. During the pandemic, he spent months sowing doubt about the efficacy of the vaccine and refusing to get a jab.In September 2021, that prompted doubt about whether he would be able to attend the UN\u2019s General Assembly in New York.\u201cThere was no adulteration on my part, it didn\u2019t happen,\u201d he told reporters on Wednesday after the search. \u201cI didn\u2019t take the vaccine, period. I never denied that.\u201dIn an interview for Jovem Pan television, Bolsonaro added that his vaccination records were not required for any of his trips to the US.",
        "\u201cThe way heads of state are treated is different than for the common citizen. Everything is arranged ahead of time, and in my travels to the United States, I was not at any time required to have a vaccination card,\u201d he said.The search adds to Bolsonaro\u2019s mounting legal headaches. Federal Police have questioned him at their Brasilia headquarters twice in the past month related to separate investigations, about three sets of diamond jewellery he received from Saudi Arabia and his potential role in sparking the January 8 uprising by his supporters in the capital.Bolsonaro is also the subject of several investigations by Brazil\u2019s electoral court into his actions during the presidential election campaign, particularly his unsubstantiated claims that the nation\u2019s electronic voting system is susceptible to fraud.Those threaten to strip him of his political rights and render him unable to run for office in upcoming elections.Separately, Bolsonaro and his allies also face a sprawling Supreme Court-led investigation regarding the spread of alleged falsehoods and disinformation in Brazil, and a federal police investigation for the alleged genocide of the Indigenous Yanomami people in the Amazon rainforest by encouraging illegal miners to invade their territory and thereby endangering their lives.The former president has denied wrongdoing in all of the cases under investigation.",
        "The police statement said the insertion of false Covid-19 data occurred between November 2021 and December 2022, and enabled the people whose vaccine cards were altered to comply with the US vaccine requirement to enter the country.The investigation indicates the objective was related to \u201cideological agendas\u201d and meant to \u201csustain the discourse aimed at attacking the vaccine against Covid-19\u2033, the statement said.For months, Bolsonaro insisted the anti-malarial hydroxychloroquine was a treatment for Covid-19, despite a lack of robust medical evidence.At one point, he warned Brazilians there would be no legal recourse against Pfizer for anyone suffering irreversible side effects. He also linked the vaccine to Aids \u2014 an assertion rejected by doctors and scientists \u2014 prompting a justice of Brazil\u2019s top court to order his comments be investigated.Brazil\u2019s pandemic death toll was the second-highest in the world. A congressional investigation determined Bolsonaro should be indicted for bungling the nation\u2019s Covid response, including him pushing unproven treatments.Bolsonaro recently returned to Brazil after several months in the US, where he mostly kept a low profile aside from a few speaking engagements.This weekend, as he seeks to reclaim his position of influence in Brazil, he travelled to the interior of Sao Paulo state and appeared at a massive agriculture show."
