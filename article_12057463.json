Maikel Garcia scored Perez with an RBI single, giving the Royals a 2-1 lead in the fourth.\"I hit the ball pretty good, but it counts as a homer no matter how far you hit it,\" Perez said. \"...We have to do this more consistently and it was a great win today. We will try to come in tomorrow and do the same thing.\"Nick Pratto hit a two-run double in the eighth to highlight a three-run inning.Ryan Yarbrough (1-4) pitched 5 2/3 innings and allowed one run on three hits with two strikeouts and a hit batter. Yarbrough was removed from the game in the sixth after getting hit in the face by a liner that was 106.2 mph off the bat of Ryan Noda. Yarbrough was able to walk off the field with the assistance of trainers.\"Your heart drops in those moments, it is one of the worst things you can see on the field,\" Royals manager Matt Quatraro said. \"Luckily, when we got out there, (Yarbarough) was aware of what was going on. He is going to get more tests. As far as his outing until that point, that was just what we are used to seeing from him.\"",
        "Royals relievers Carlos Hernandez, Aroldis Chapman and Scott Barlow each tossed scoreless outings.Mason Miller (0-2) gave up two runs on five hits with five strikeouts and a hit batter in six innings of work.(Miller) is building momentum and I think each start he is just getting better and better,\" Oakland manager Mark Kotsay said. \"Veteran Salvador (Perez) got him early in the game and seemed to see him pretty well, but was probably the only guy in the lineup really. Overall, good performance.\"Ram\u00f3n Laureano broke an 0-for-10 stretch with an RBI single in the fourth. Esteury Ruiz extended his hitting streak to nine games in a 1-for-4 afternoon.REMEMBERING VIDA BLUEPrior to first-pitch, there was a moment of silence remembering Vida Blue, who died Saturday at the age of 73.
