The Canadian economy gained 41,400 jobs in April, exceeding expectations for an increase of 20,000, while the jobless rate stayed at 5.0% for a fifth consecutive month, Statistics Canada data showed.\"Another blockbuster Canadian jobs number,\" said Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Corpay.\"It smashed expectations and pointed to resilience in the underlying economy, and will almost certainly narrow interest rate differentials against the U.S. on the front of the curve by lowering the likelihood of rate cuts by the Bank of Canada and pushing those into 2024 at the earliest.\"Money markets are still pricing in an interest rate cut by the BoC this year, but chances of a cut as soon as October fell to about 50% from 70% before the data.On Thursday, BoC Governor Tiff Macklem said that the bank is ready to tighten further if Canadian inflation gets stuck significantly above target. The bank's benchmark rate has been on hold at a 15-year high of 4.50% since January.",
