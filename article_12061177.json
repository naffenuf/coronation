        "Donald Trump should be held accountable for sexually attacking an advice columnist in 1996 because even a former president is not above the law, a lawyer for the columnist told a jury on Monday in closing arguments in the lawsuit that accuses Trump of rape.",
        "A lawyer for Trump responded by calling the accuser\u2019s account \u201cunbelievable\u201d and \u201coutrageous\u201d.Once the final arguments were complete, the judge sent the jury home with instructions to return on Tuesday to hear about an hour of instructions before beginning deliberations.Jurors will be asked to decide whether Mr Trump committed battery and defamed writer E Jean Carroll and whether damages should be awarded.In recapping Carroll\u2019s case, attorney Roberta Kaplan showed jurors video clips of Trump from his October deposition and replayed the Access Hollywood video from 2005 in which Trump said into a hot mic that celebrities can grab women\u2019s genitals without asking.Ms Kaplan recalled Trump\u2019s comment that \u201cstars like him can get away with sexually assaulting women\u201d.\u201cThat\u2019s who Donald Trump is. That is how he thinks. And that\u2019s what he does,\u201d Ms Kaplan said. \u201cHe thinks he can get away with it here.\u201dMs Kaplan used Trump\u2019s words to support Carroll\u2019s claims that Trump raped her in early spring 1996 in the dressing room of Bergdorf Goodman, a luxury department store in Manhattan across the street from Trump Tower.Trump\u2019s attorney, Joe Tacopina, attacked the allegations as absurd, saying they were an \u201caffront to justice\u201d and minimised \u201creal rape victims\u201d.He agreed with Ms Kaplan that no one is above the law, but he warned that \u201cno one\u2019s below it\u201d either.",
        "Mr Tacopina told jurors they will not have to \u201clet her profit to the tune of millions of dollars\u201d because they will see that it is impossible to believe the \u201cunbelievable\u201d.\u201cThis is an absolutely outrageous case,\u201d he said, arguing that Ms Carroll sued to raise her status and for political reasons.He said even Ms Carroll had testified that it was an \u201castonishing coincidence\u201d that a Law and Order offshoot aired an episode in 2012 in which a woman is raped in the dressing room of a Bergdorf Goodman.\u201cWhat is the likelihood of that?\u201d Mr Tacopina asked. \u201cOne in 20 billion? One in 10 billion?\u201dTacopina said the claims were too absurd to call his client as a witness, noting that Carroll expected jurors to believe Trump would risk everything to attack a woman in a busy department store even though she could not remember exactly when the assault happened.\u201cWhat could I have asked Donald Trump? Where were you on some unknown date, 27 or 28 years ago?\u201d he said. Consider the evidence and pick a number you think is right. This lawsuit is not about the money. This lawsuit is about getting her name back  Roberta Kaplan, E Jean Carroll's attorney  In a rebuttal argument, Ms Carroll\u2019s attorney, Mike Ferrara, mocked Trump\u2019s decision to skip the trial, saying jurors could use his absence to conclude that Trump committed the attack because Trump \u201cnever looked you in the eye and denied it\u201d.",
        "Mr Kaplan told jurors that it wasn\u2019t a \u201che said, she said\u201d case but rather one in which jurors should weigh what 11 witnesses, including Ms Carroll, said versus what they heard from Trump in his video deposition.\u201cHe didn\u2019t even bother to show up here in person,\u201d Ms Kaplan said, referring to Trump\u2019s absence from the proceedings in federal court.She told jurors that much of what he said in his deposition and in public statements \u201cactually supports our side of the case.\u201d\u201cIn a very real sense, Donald Trump is a witness against himself,\u201d she said. \u201cHe knows what he did. He knows that he sexually assaulted E Jean Carroll.\u201dTrump has insisted in public statements and in the deposition that Ms arroll made up the claims to boost sales of a 2019 memoir. He has called Ms Carroll \u201cmentally sick\u201d and a \u201cdisgrace\u201d.Carroll, 79, who is seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages, testified for more than two days. Ms Kaplan praised her testimony as \u201ccredible\u201d.\u201cIt was consistent, and it was powerful,\u201d the lawyer said.Trump\u2019s public comments are the basis of Ms Carroll\u2019s defamation claim. Ms Kaplan labelled the comments as lies and said they ruined her client\u2019s reputation and forced an end to her 27-year employment as an Elle magazine advance columnist.",
        "Ms aplan urged jurors to find in favour of \u201cmy brave client, E Jean Carroll,\u201d but she put no number on the damages being sought.\u201cConsider the evidence and pick a number you think is right,\u201d she said. \u201cThis lawsuit is not about the money. This lawsuit is about getting her name back.\u201d"
