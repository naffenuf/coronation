        "The radio queen, 48, positively glowed as she stepped out in a long knitted dress which clung to her frame and hung heavy about her ankles.\u00a0Sporting a matching black and gold Fendi bag and earrings to elevate the look, she slipped on a white dress beneath her brown, see-through frock.\u00a0Hiding her eyes behind a set of dark designer glasses, she slicked her golden tresses back into a tight pony which highlighted her genetically blessed features.\u00a0The media personality was all smiles as she bought a $430 maxi dress from\u00a0Maison Essentiele before heading a few more doors down to buy something else.\u00a0",
        "Jackie appeared at ease despite hopping on radio the next morning to reveal she has a stalker somewhere in Australia.\u00a0Speaking with co-host Kyle Sandilands on their KIIS FM show Friday morning, they discussed Sophie Monk's recent run-in with an allegedly 'catfished' man who showed up to her house.The shock jock jokingly asked Jackie why she didn't have any stalkers, to which the radio host replied: 'Mine don't live here thankfully.'",
        "When Kyle, 51, pushed for more information, she added: 'They're in Australia but I'm not going to say [where].\u00a0No one has turned up to my house thank god.'He then joked Jackie moves around too much for any stalker to narrow in on her location.\u00a0",

        "The mother of one splashed out $13.25million on a three-storey oceanfront house in Clovelly at an open auction in March.She went up against two other keen bidders for the six-bedroom fixer upper as her 11-year-old daughter Kitty stood by her side.Jackie pocketed a tidy $2million in profit on the sale of her old home in Woollahra, after paying $1million over the $10million asking price for it in 2020."
