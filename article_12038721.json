        "Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp\u2019s insistence he did not intentionally call referee Paul Tierney\u2019s integrity into question has not prevented the Football Association charging him with improper conduct.",
        "While blaming the emotion of a last-gasp 4-3 win over Tottenham, having been 3-0 up, can in no way excuse the Reds boss for charging down the touchline to celebrate wildly in front of fourth official John Brooks or his suggestions Tierney \u201chad history\u201d with the club, Klopp said he never meant to cast aspersions.Tierney actually appears to have done Klopp a favour by not sending him off as the German claimed the referee had told him his actions on the touchline were worthy of a red card but he chose to issue a yellow on the advice of Brooks.",
        "It was that red card suggestion which led Klopp to say what Tierney said to him was \u201cnot OK\u201d, with the 55-year-old German insisting he has not lied about the interaction after the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) rejected Tierney\u2019s actions were \u201cimproper\u201d and insisted a review of the recording proves Tierney behaved in a \u201cprofessional manner\u201d.But it was Klopp\u2019s comments that the referee was acting against Liverpool based on past experiences which has landed him with a misconduct charge and facing an extended touchline ban.The FA\u2019s statement said \u201cthey imply bias, and/or question the integrity of the referee, and/or are personal/offensive, and/or bring the game into disrepute\u201d.",
        "\u201cI probably have to expect the punishment,\u201d said Klopp, speaking before he learned of the charge, who has until Friday to respond.\u201cI think the refs think I questioned the integrity (of their colleague), which when I am calm and sitting here I don\u2019t do, but in that moment I just describe my feelings.\u201cI am very sure he is not doing it intentionally but we have a history and I cannot deny that.\u201cOf course they didn\u2019t happen intentionally but they are still there and it\u2019s a feeling and nothing else.\u201cI know the refs were really angry about what I said and now go for it. I heard I was lying.\u201cI did a lot of things that day but I didn\u2019t lie. I shouldn\u2019t have said a couple of things but lying was not one of them.\u201d",
        "Klopp served a one-game suspension in November after the FA successfully appealed against an independent regulatory commission decision to only fine him \u00a330,000 in regards to his behaviour in confronting assistant referee Gary Beswick and subsequently being sent of by referee Anthony Taylor.He said he regretted allowing his emotions to get the better of him again.\u201cWe won a football game 4-3 in a very spectacular manner and the only headlines are the ones I created and I really regret that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is absolutely not necessary and not how it should be.",
        "\u201cThe whole situation shouldn\u2019t have happened at all. It was out of emotion, it was out of anger in that moment. That\u2019s why I celebrated the way I celebrated. I understand I opened the box. It was not intentional but I opened it  Jurgen Klopp  \u201cPaul Tierney came over to me and I didn\u2019t expect at all a red card. I know I had a red card not too long ago but I didn\u2019t expect for a second a red card because I didn\u2019t feel it was right.\u201cHe (Tierney) said to me \u2018For me it\u2019s a red card but because of him\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s what I understood because it was loud in the stadium \u2013 \u2018but because of him (Brooks) it\u2019s yellow\u2019. Showed me a yellow and smiled to my face. That\u2019s it.\u201cThe final whistle we go inside and I try to calm down and it didn\u2019t work out properly and I said what I said.\u201cI said \u2018What he said to me was not OK\u2019 and I thought it was not OK because it was not a red card in my view.\u201cI understand I opened the box. It was not intentional but I opened it.\u201dLiverpool face Fulham on Wednesday looking for a fourth successive victory to maintain their unlikely pursuit of Champions League football.",
        "There will inevitably be increased scrutiny on the manager but he said: \u201cIf there is one good thing, I prefer I am in that situation than any player.\u201cWe will see but I can\u2019t see it will have an influence on the team.\u201d"
