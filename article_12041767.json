        "The 35-year-old has been offered a new contract by PSG on the same financial terms, but doubt remains on his side about the sporting project.\u00a0French newspaper\u00a0L'Equipe\u00a0has reported that there are doubt on PSG's side whether their relationship with the Argentine extends beyond the summer.They add that PSG's decision to suspend Messi has caused an 'explosion' which could have a 'planetary impact'.Those around Messi say the trip was previously postponed twice and it was difficult to do so at short notice for a third time.Barcelona want him to return, while there is interest from the Middle East and MLS clubs. However, he has still to open concrete negotiations with any other club.\u00a0"
