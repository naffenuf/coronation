        "Sky Sports are planning on making an internal appointment to replace Jeff Stelling as host of Soccer Saturday next season after the veteran presenter announced his departure on last weekend\u2019s programme.Sky are in the midst of a major cost-cutting exercise after losing nine per cent of their UK subscribers last year, with a number of their football reporters facing redundancy, and a big-money recruit from outside the organisation is viewed as inappropriate in the circumstances.Match of the Day 2 host Mark Chapman was approached by Sky to front Soccer Saturday when Stelling considered stepping down last year.But existing staff members\u00a0Julian Warren and Adam Smith are now viewed as the front-runners.",
        "Tyler not ready to follow in Stelling's footsteps\u00a0Sky's veteran commentator Martin Tyler has no intention of following Stelling and top pundit Graeme Souness, who also announced his departure last weekend.\u00a0Tyler, 77, demonstrated his remarkable work ethic by commentating on three live Premier League games in the space of four days for Sky this week and is determined to carry on next season.\u00a0",

        "49ers Enterprises president Paraag Marathe has been on the board at Elland Road since they first bought into the club five years ago and is now heavily involved in all major decisions.As Mail Sport revealed last month, Leeds\u2019 value will drop by about \u00a3220million if they are relegated so the 49ers\u2019 initial outlay would be far less if they are in the Championship, but the NFL franchise\u2019s primary consideration is keeping the club in the Premier League.",
        "World Cup TV row escalatesEuropean broadcasters have valued the Women\u2019s World Cup at less than one per cent of the price they paid for the men\u2019s tournament in Qatar, with the stand-off over TV rights of this summer\u2019s competition in Australia and New Zealand set to continue.\u00a0Mail Sport has learned that the offer FIFA received from Italian state broadcaster RAI was below \u00a31million for the entire tournament \u2014 in contrast to the \u00a3100m they paid last year to cover a World Cup for which Italy did not even qualify. German company ARD also offered less than three per cent of what they paid last year.",
        "The leading offers from broadcasters in Spain and Italy were worth less than five per cent of the value of the men\u2019s TV deal, leading FIFA president Gianni Infantino to threaten a TV blackout in Europe.",
