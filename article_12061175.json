        "Everton THRASH high-flying Brighton 5-1 to move out of the drop zone\u00a0Dyche insisted his side never doubted themselves after precious away winEverton have three matches remaining to secure their top-flight safetyEverton boss Sean Dyche insisted his side never doubted themselves after a thumping 5-1 Premier League victory over Brighton lifted the Toffees two points clear of the relegation zone.",
        "It was Everton's first away league win in 14 attempts and could not have come at a more opportune time, with just three matches now remaining to secure their top-flight safety.Abdoulaye Doucoure's strike after 33 seconds laid down what retrospectively ultimately felt like an emphatic opening statement as both he and Dwight McNeil went on to scores braces on either side of the half.Dyche said: 'People will be out there thinking right, OK, there's life in that team but we've never lost sight of that.'It just reminds the players that their work ethic, their commitment to the cause, their commitment to the group is really important because I know there's quality.",

        "Alexis Mac Allister clawed one back before McNeil's first but the Brighton burial was not complete until McNeil fired home the visitors' fifth in the embers of second-half stoppage-time.Victory meant Dyche's side are safe for the time being, with league leaders Manchester City up next followed by encounters with Wolves and Bournemouth.'They're very high feeling the feel-good factor,' he added. 'But it's only another step. I said that after Arsenal, and sometimes people forget that. There's three more big steps we've got to take.'"
