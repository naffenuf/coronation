        "The King and the Prince and Princess of Wales have greeted well-wishers on the Mall on the eve of the coronation.",
        "Charles, William and Kate made the surprise appearance to the delight of huge crowds gathered outside Buckingham Palace.",
        "The trio took time to shake hands with members of the public as people cheered, took selfies and sang God Save the King.Charles went to one side of the Mall while William and Kate went to another.",
        "One woman told Charles \u201cLove you Charlie\u201d while others passed on their congratulations.At one point, Kate appeared to join a fan in a video call before also speaking on another fan\u2019s phone then handing it back.Alison Cowburn was among those to shake the King\u2019s hand.The 62-year-old, who had travelled to London from Derby, told the PA news agency: \u201cI said it was very nice to meet him and he said \u2018have you been camping?\u2019\u201cI said no we are just down for the day and he said \u2018nothing so rash as that then\u2019.\u201dOn how she felt after the encounter, she said: \u201cBrilliant, so delighted. Absolutely ecstatic.\u201dThe King laughed when asked by a man if he was \u201cnervous for tomorrow\u201d and was was heard joking to some children, \u201cNo school? You\u2019ve done very well!\u201d",
        "William told one woman \u201cI love your hair bow\u201d, while Kate told another person that the occasion \u201cis a great moment for celebration\u201d.",
        "Earlier, the King took part a final coronation rehearsal at Westminster Abbey, where a 2,300-strong coronation congregation, and a television audience likely to be in the tens of millions, will watch him being crowned on Saturday.The King has a busy day with a series of diplomatic duties and has been joined by working royals at a special lunch for realm prime ministers and governors general at Buckingham Palace.Charles, who is head of the Commonwealth, will also attend a Commonwealth Heads of Government leaders\u2019 meeting and garden reception at London\u2019s Marlborough House the same day.Also on the eve of the coronation, the King and the royal family will host a glittering reception for foreign royalty and other overseas dignitaries at the Palace.The final preparations come as broadcaster Jonathan Dimbleby, a friend of Charles who wrote his authorised biography, said the monarch would find the Homage of the People \u201cabhorrent\u201d.For the first time, those watching the coronation ceremony will be invited to make their own homage to Charles, replacing the traditional homage of peers, but some commentators have criticised the new element as divisive.",
        "Mr Dimbleby told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cI can think of nothing that he would find more abhorrent.\u201cHe\u2019s never wanted to be revered, he\u2019s never wanted \u2013 so as far as I know \u2013 to have anyone pay homage to him except in mock terms as a joke.",
        "\u201cHe wants, I think, to feel that people will share in the event and I don\u2019t quite know how this might have happened.\u201dMeanwhile, those travelling across the UK on public transport are being reminded to \u201cmind the gap\u201d by the King.Charles and Camilla have recorded an announcement which is being played between Friday and Monday at every railway station across the UK and all London Underground stations, industry body the Rail Delivery Group said.In the message, the King begins by telling passengers: \u201cMy wife and I wish you and your families a wonderful coronation weekend.\u201dCamilla then says: \u201cWherever you are travelling, we hope you have a safe and pleasant journey.\u201dThe message concludes with Charles adding: \u201cAnd remember, please mind the gap.\u201dIt was recorded at Highgrove earlier this year by the audio team from Transport for London."
