        "The Diary Of A Teenage Girl actress, 31,\u00a0\u00a0who recently starred in A Small Light and Everything I Know About Love, reflected on the industry at the start of her career.\u00a0The actress said before the MeToo movement, there was a very different culture while filming - especially when she was younger.\u00a0Bel claimed she was once 'touched inappropriately' by a senior member of the crew while working on an indie film in her early 20s.\u00a0\u00a0She told The Independent: 'I\u2019ve had someone grab my a**e and basically touch me inappropriately before\u00a0but I was too scared to say anything. I was too scared to rock the boat.'",
        "She continued: 'I just avoided that person and it was fine, but what really has changed post-MeToo is you just know that you\u2019re protected.'\u00a0And on camera too things were far from easy as a young woman trying to make it in the industry.\u00a0Bel said poorly-written contracts and awkwardness meant she felt obliged to feature in sex scenes, even though she felt uncomfortable.\u00a0However she added that there seems to be a 'new code of conduct' since the MeToo movement as actors feel more protected.\u00a0\u00a0Since then she has starred in A Royal Night Out as Princess Margaret and as the lead in Dolly Parton's Everything I Know About Love.\u00a0",
