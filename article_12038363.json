        "GUATEMALA CITY, May 2 (Reuters) - Businessman and political newcomer Carlos Pineda was the top choice of voters ahead of Guatemala's June 25 presidential election in a poll released on Tuesday, with former first lady Sandra Torres second and veteran diplomat Edmond Mulet third.",
        "Voters will be choosing a successor to President Alejandro Giammattei, whose term ends in January 2024.The Prensa Libre poll showed Pineda with the support of 23.1% of respondents, followed by Torres at 19.5%, Mulet at 10.1% and Zury Rios, the daughter of the late dictator Efrain Rios Montt, at 9.2%. The poll surveyed 1,202 voters between April 14 and 23, asking them to chose among 23 presidential candidates. It had a margin of error of 2.8%.Giammattei is a conservative who has been widely criticized for his administration's repression of judges, prosecutors, journalists and activists - many of whom are now in exile.Pineda is making his first run at the presidency, while Torres has run several times previously and Mulet once before.If no candidate achieves a majority on June 25, an Aug. 20 runoff would be held to determine the winner.(Reporting by Sofia Menchu; Writing by Sarah Morland; Editing by Will Dunham)"
