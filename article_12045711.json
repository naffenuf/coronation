        "She said Kingston 'knew God and I know that\u2019s exactly who he\u2019s with now. Up there singing his big heart out.'\u00a0",
        "'I\u2019m hurt that it had to be my child but I pray that no one else has to go through this pain that I have to,' she added.A police search warrant reportedly showed that others inside the duplex home on Floyd Street suffered minor injuries from the shooting.In a released statement, Lynchburg police called Kingston's death a 'senseless tragedy stemming from a violent criminal act that has no place in our community.'\u00a0Police attempted to reassure the public on Tuesday that there is no active threat to them.No arrests have been made at this time and police urged anyone with information on the killing to come forward.\u00a0"
