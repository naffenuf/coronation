        "Sergio Garcia, Lee Westwood, Ian Poulter and Richard Bland officially resigned from the DP World Tour on Wednesday.",
        "The move comes in the aftermath of last month's ruling by an arbitration panel, validating the world tour's ability to fine and suspend golfers who jumped to LIV Golf.The foursome opted to resign rather than face a $125,000 fine for playing LIV events without permission.\"The DP World Tour would like to take this opportunity to thank the four players for the contribution they have made to the Tour and in particular to Sergio, Ian and Lee for the significant part they have played in Europe's success in the Ryder Cup over many years,\" the circuit said in a release.\"Their resignations, however, along with the sanctions imposed upon them, are a consequence of their own choices.\"--Field Level Media"
