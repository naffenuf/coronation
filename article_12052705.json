It's a proud expression of our history, culture, and traditions. A vivid demonstration of the modern character of our country. And a cherished ritual through which a new era is born.\"Sunak said the ceremony at the abbey, where kings of England and Britain have been crowned since 1066, would involve representatives from every faith for the first time.\"So let's celebrate this weekend with pride in who we are and what we stand for,\" he said. \"Let's look to the future with hope and optimism. And let's make new memories, so we can tell our grandchildren of the day we came together to sing: God Save The King.\" (Reporting by Michael Holden; Editing by Janet Lawrence)"
