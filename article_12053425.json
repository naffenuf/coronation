Anthony Martial - seriously? He shouldn't be playing for Manchester United, sorry.'\u00a0Ten Hag made four changes for the visit to Brighton, bringing in Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Fred, Antony and Martial.\u00a0The 27-year-old\u00a0has struggled with problems relating to his hip, hamstring, back and Achilles this term.\u00a0Martial has registered seven goals and three assists in 24 appearances this season.The Frenchman is still under contract until 2024 and is reportedly on wages of around \u00a3240,000-a-week.",

So I count on my team, we have to do it again,' Ten Hag said.'The players have to take responsibility and I count on them. We have everything in our hands, so we have to focus on our performance... I am quite confident about that.'We need to be there, in the Champions League (next season). We want to be there because we want to challenge the best teams in the world so we do everything in our power to get that done.'"
