        "Roy Hodgson rubbished \u201cinsulting\u201d reports of Wilfried Zaha being unhappy at his substitution against West Ham last week as he defended the player ahead of Crystal Palace\u2019s trip to Tottenham.",
        "The Ivory Coast forward appeared to cut a frustrated figure when he was brought off during Palace\u2019s 4-3 win over the Hammers.However, Palace manager Hodgson has since refuted suggestions it was as a result of being taken off the pitch, instead claiming the attacker\u2019s unhappiness was in response to another player on the pitch.\u201cHe\u2019s fine, he\u2019s a good captain. I\u2019m irritated to some extent,\u201d Hodgson said.\u201cThe press are reporting that Wilf was angry at being taken off, how do the press feel they have the right to report that?\u201cHe wasn\u2019t angry at being taken off at all. In fact he and I discussed him playing an extra 10 minutes when I\u2019d been thinking about taking him off 10 minutes earlier.",
        "\u201cI hear that he was going on about one of the other players in the game, he\u00a0certainly wasn\u2019t moaning about being taken off.\u201dZaha returned to the line-up against West Ham after a spell out with injury and scored Palace\u2019s second on a day where he was named captain of the side.And Hodgson alluded to his leadership qualities in a team of young players as Palace prepare to face an out-of-form Spurs on Saturday.\u201cIt\u2019s an insult really as we are talking about someone who I made captain of the team, and he was working hard to show an example to the team, saying this is what\u2019s needed,\u201d the manager said.",
        "\u201cFor him to read that Wilf Zaha throws his toys out the pram is totally and utterly untrue, I think that\u2019s unfair. I think that\u2019s bad journalism. Hopefully you guys weren\u2019t responsible, one b****** was that\u2019s for sure.\u201dPalace\u2019s resurgence in form under Hodgson has seen them pick up four wins in six and hit the 40-point-mark for the season \u2013 a tally the Eagles boss believes has secured their Premier League status for next season.He said: \u201cForty is always a target. I didn\u2019t go down and set that target and speak to the players about it. We keep getting points where we can and let\u2019s in every game try and come away with something, that\u2019s probably been the only real, serious aim.\u201cNow we have got to 40 we can say the job is done in the sense that we aren\u2019t going to get relegated. These last four games, I think, are an ideal opportunity to get extra points and hopefully win other games and get ourselves, if possible, higher up the table.\u201d"
