        "British boxer John Ryder claims he will be no pushover as he prepares to fight Saul \u2018Canelo\u2019 Alvarez for the undisputed super middleweight titles this weekend.",
        "Ryder has travelled to Guadalajara in Mexico as he aims to become England\u2019s first undisputed male champion in the four-belt era on May 6.Canelo bounced back from his defeat to Dmitry Bivol, this exact weekend last year, with a unanimous decision victory over Gennadiy Golovkin four months later and while fighting in Mexico is new for Ryder, Canelo has never fought in front of his home crowd either.Much discussion leading up to the fight has claimed champion Canelo has chosen an \u2018easy\u2019 bout in a bid to add another British fighter to his winning record, along with the other seven that have come before The Gorilla.Ryder is keen to show the world that Saturday will not be straightforward for Canelo and is ready to make a statement.He told the PA news agency: \u201cI\u2019m sure people do see it as an easy fight but I\u2019m in there to make a statement and stake my own claim on the super-middleweight division.",
        "\u201cI want to show people I do deserve to be a true world champion. I was harshly judged on in the fight with (Callum) Smith and already should have a world title but I\u2019m blessed that this opportunity has come now.\u201cI\u2019ve worked hard, I\u2019ve had a few more fights in and around that level, picked up the interim world title and now I\u2019m sitting in a fantastic position taking on Canelo next.\u201d",
        "Ryder has previously lost five career fights to Billy Joe Saunders, Nick Blackwell, Jack Arnfield, Rocky Fielding, and the most recent being Callum Smith in 2019 by unanimous decision.Since then, Ryder has won four fights which has given him the opportunity to take on Canelo, but he is not treating it any bigger than any of his previous match-ups.He added: \u201cI treat every fight as my biggest challenge and I used to get nervous for the first couple of fights I was going in with so-called journeymen.\u201cThe thought of losing a fight like that petrified me because you lose to them people and you are on a road to nowhere, so I always go into every fight giving the opponent the respect they deserve and Canelo is no different.\u201cIf I say I\u2019m supremely confident then people think I\u2019m delusional but I wouldn\u2019t be going out there if I wasn\u2019t confident in my own ability and wouldn\u2019t be taking a team out there that I am.\u201d",
        "The fight will be the first ever boxing match to take place at the Akron Stadium, with around 48,000 fans expected to be in attendance.\u201cI think the Mexican fans are real fight fans,\u201d Ryder said.\u201cAs long as you\u2019ve giving them what they want to see and putting it all on the line\u2026 I\u2019m sure they might boo on the way in but cheer on the way out.\u201d",
