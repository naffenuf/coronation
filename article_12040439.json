In their semifinal series, Tigres bring a 2-1 lead into the second leg at Leon on Wednesday.The dates of the final have yet to be announced.For the opening goal on Tuesday, LAFC's Carlos Vela delivered a corner kick that teammate Ilie Sanchez headed on net. Union goalie Andre Blake made the save, but Tillman banged home the rebound from close range.Philadelphia saw its comeback chances diminished when Olivier Mbaizo was sent off after he received a second yellow card in the 59th minute. He previously was booked in the 41st minute.In the 82nd minute, Vela was Los Angeles' provider again. An unmarked Vela delivered a through ball to Opoku, who fired a 12-yard shot past Blake and inside the far post.Bouanga capped the rout when he ran onto a pass from Jose Cifuentes into the penalty area and beat Blake with a shot from close to the penalty spot.",
