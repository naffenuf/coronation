        "Alexis Mac Allister believes Brighton are proving they have the quality to reach Europe after his nerveless penalty secured an \u201cunforgettable\u201d 1-0 win over Manchester United.",
        "The Seagulls soared to sixth spot in the Premier League table, above Tottenham and Aston Villa, thanks to Mac Allister thumping home with virtually the last kick of Thursday\u2019s pulsating contest.Roberto De Zerbi\u2019s free-flowing side have two games in hand on Spurs and Villa, as well as fifth-placed Liverpool, who sit just four points above them.Argentina midfielder Mac Allister says Albion must focus on their own situation and results as they bid to cap a memorable campaign by achieving continental qualification.\u201cWe know that it\u2019s the end of the season and these three points are very important,\u201d he told Brighton\u2019s club website.\u201cThe way we are playing is very important because we feel very good. We will do our best to finish as high as we can.",
        "\u201cWe have to think about ourselves and not look at the other teams. If we play the way we play, we will have big chances to fight for a European spot and that has to be our aim.\u201dWorld Cup winner Mac Allister kept his composure to fire into the top-left corner from 12 yards nine minutes into added time after Luke Shaw\u2019s inexplicable handball was penalised following VAR intervention.The 24-year-old\u2019s 11th club goal of the season prompted more jubilant scenes inside the Amex Stadium on the back of Saturday\u2019s record-breaking 6-0 hammering of Wolves.",
        "\u201cIt was so special,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the team and the fans, it was an amazing win and something unforgettable.\u201dBrighton\u2019s last-gasp success partially avenged their painful FA Cup semi-final penalty shoot-out defeat to United 11 days earlier.The Seagulls also broke the club-record top-flight points tally by moving on to 55 \u2013 three more than they managed in the the 42-game 1981-82 season \u2013 with six games still to go.Goalkeeper Jason Steele, who made smart saves to deny Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial and Bruno Fernandes, admits Albion\u2019s recent Wembley agony gave them additional incentive.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t about revenge or anything like that,\u201d he said. \u201cDid we have a little bit extra motivation? Yeah, probably.\u201cBut I don\u2019t think it spilled over into anything other than that and we deserved to win.\u201cIt was a big night for us. Two good teams were going toe to toe, really enjoyable to play in and the last-minute winner, you can\u2019t beat that.\u201dBrighton complete a trio of consecutive home games against relegation-threatened Everton on Monday evening.The fitness of Pascal Gross and Evan Ferguson will be assessed ahead of that match but head coach De Zerbi does not expect to have Joel Veltman back from injury."
