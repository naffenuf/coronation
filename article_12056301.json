        "The Queen\u2019s coronation bouquet has been laid at the Grave of the Unknown Warrior, Buckingham Palace has said.",
        "The flowers were placed on\u00a0the grave at Westminster Abbey at Camilla\u2019s request following Saturday\u2019s coronation service at the church.A tweet from the King and Queen\u2019s official twitter account \u2013 @RoyalFamily \u2013 shows a delicate bouquet of yellow, white and pink flowers sitting on the tomb.It is a simple-tied bunch of English spring flowers including auriculas and lily of the valley \u2013 both of which featured in the Queen\u2019s wedding bouquet in 2005 \u2013 along with hellebores, which the King wore in his buttonhole during the couple\u2019s wedding 18 years ago and are a particular favourite of his.Jasmine and wallflowers add to the sweet scent of the bouquet, which was created by Shane Connolly.Camilla did not carry the flowers on coronation day.",
        "Mr Connolly, from west Belfast, also made the floral arrangements which adorned Westminster Abbey for the coronation service.He previously said his aim with the arrangements of seasonal home-grown blooms and foliage was to make them \u201cincredibly personal\u201d to Charles and Camilla as well as showing that UK-grown flowers can be used at an event of this size.Mr Connolly also created the floral arrangements at Charles and Camilla\u2019s wedding in 2005 and the Prince and Princess of Wales\u2019s wedding in 2011."
