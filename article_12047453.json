        "A pizzeria has gone viral on social media after it created a pizza in the shape of the King\u2019s face, complete with Italian sausage nostrils and a crown made out of chips.",
        "Gerry Sweeney, owner of Villaggio Pizza in Eaglesham near Glasgow, is the creator behind what is being dubbed online as the \u201ccoronation pizza\u201d, and he said the food item is \u201csilly\u201d but has brought a smile to many in the local community.The 14-inch pizza, which has more than 4,000 upvotes on Reddit, is made with two balls of dough to create the face and ears, topped with tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella for the eyes, nose and mouth, and Italian sausage for the nostrils.With the coronation taking place on Saturday, the 54-year-old said he felt he had to mark the historic event and create something special.He told the PA news agency: \u201cI thought we had to do something\u2026 we normally do a special every week and I was thinking about coronation chicken, chicken burgers or coronation chicken salads or pizzas.",
        "\u201cI\u2019ve made funny-face pizzas before for people\u2019s birthdays\u2026 just silly stuff and this one is a bit of fun.\u201dHe said the pizza is \u201ca wee bit of work\u201d as it is twice cooked and takes five times longer to create than his regular pizzas.\u201cIt takes 10 or 15 minutes to make that pizza, whereas if you walk in, three minutes you\u2019ll get a pizza in a box,\u201d he said.",
        "\u201cIt takes a wee bit of work and there\u2019s more dough. Two dough balls \u2013 one for the face and another for the ears.\u201cIt\u2019s in the oven twice rather than once.\u201dThe coronation pizza is also made using red onions to replicate Charles\u2019s hair as well as chips to build the crown.Red peppers and green jalapenos are added to form the jewels of the crown.",
        "Mr Sweeney, who has owned Villaggio Pizza for more than three years, created the large coronation pizza last Friday and put it on display for customers to admire.\u201cAll the customers were talking about it,\u201d he said.\u201cThey were all laughing and taking photographs.\u201dHe added that many could not wait to send a picture of the pizza to their friends, with one customer saying \u201cwait until my sister sees this\u201d.While the pizzas are not for sale, Mr Sweeney said he may \u201cmake a few\u201d for those who order for Saturday\u2019s coronation day, but admits that the large creation \u201ctakes too long to make\u201d."
