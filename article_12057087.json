        "The King grumbled \u201cwe can never be on time\u201d and \u201cthere\u2019s always something\u201d following a hiccup at the start of his coronation, a lip reader has claimed.",
        "Charles and Camilla arrived at Westminster Abbey early, while the Prince and Princess of Wales \u2013 accompanied by Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis, were late, missing their scheduled arrival time.It meant the King and Queen were forced to wait outside, sat in their Diamond Jubilee State Coach, for some time for William and Kate to get there before Charles and Camilla could make their grand entrance.",
        "A lip reader for Sky News said the King complained that it was a \u201cnegative\u201d, allegedly remarking: \u201cThis is boring.\u201d\u201cWe can never be on time. Yes I\u2019m\u2026This is a negative. There\u2019s always something\u2026This is boring,\u201d Sky News reported that the frustrated-looking monarch said.William and Kate had been unable to overtake to get ahead of the King.In the end, the prince and princess, eight-year-old Charlotte and Louis, five, were forced to join the King\u2019s procession through the Abbey, instead of entering before him and waiting in their seats for Charles and Camilla\u2019s arrival.",
        "The Bishop of Chelmsford, Dr Guli Francis-Dehqani, said on Saturday, speaking outside St Margaret\u2019s Church next to the Abbey, that there were \u201cone or two\u201d hiccups.\u201cThere were one or two things that didn\u2019t go strictly to plan,\u201d he said, before adding: \u201cI\u2019m not going to embarrass anyone in particular.\u201d",
        "In the early days of his reign, the King blasted a pen after it appeared to leak while he signed a book at Hillsborough Castle, telling aides \u201cI can\u2019t bear this bloody thing\u201d.",
        "The King could be heard in a video clip asking the date, before standing up in frustration.The Queen, who was given the pen, said \u201cit\u2019s going everywhere\u201d, before the pair wiped their hands.The King was then heard saying: \u201cI can\u2019t bear this bloody thing\u2026 every stinking time.\u201dIt came after another pen-related incident at his Accession Council.",
        "While signing historic documents, he gestured for an ornate pen holder to be taken away by an aide.Later it was back in place, after privy councillors used its pens to sign documents, but Charles once again took offence to the item, when called upon to give his signature, and pulled a face before it was removed again.William and Kate were due to arrive at 10.45am, while Charles and Camilla\u2019s arrival had been set for 10.53am in the carefully organised schedule, planned months in advance."
