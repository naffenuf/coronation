During the invincible season I discovered what it was like to become a manager without fear. The team went to another level, above ego.'",
        "Wenger then revealed how he tips current Manchester City star Kevin De Bruyne to be his favourite among a list of great to join the line-up in the future, commenting on his 'exceptional decisiveness over the last five years.'De Bruyne though cannot feature immediately as only retired players can enter the Hall of Fame.\u00a0",

I had a motto growing up that said, \"if I play one minute of professional football then I would die a happy man.\" This [joining the Hall of Fame] is a fabulous curtain call.'Petr Cech, who lifted four Premier League titles across 11 seasons with Chelsea and is the clean sheet record holder with 202 was delighted to be inducted alongside his goalkeeping inspiration and fellow Hall of Famer Peter Schmeichel who previously starred for Manchester United.",
        "'One of my earliest football memories is watching Peter Schmeichel at the Euros in 1992,' Cech said. 'He inspired me and It\u2019s an honour to be inducted alongside him. Ars\u00e8ne\u2019s legacy is also undeniable.'I think the Premier League changed when he came to England and his Hall of Fame place is totally deserved.'The Hall of Fame launched in 2021, with inaugural inductees including David Beckham, Dennis Bergkamp, Eric Cantona, Thierry Henry, Roy Keane, Frank Lampard, Steven Gerrard and Alan Shearer.In 2022, Sergio Aguero, Didier Drogba, Vincent Kompany, Wayne Rooney, Peter Schmeichel, Paul Scholes, Patrick Vieira and Ian Wright, were the next group to be inducted into the Hall of Fame.",
