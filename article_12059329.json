        "BERLIN, May 8 (Reuters) - German police have arrested a cardiology specialist suspended from Berlin's Charite hospital on suspicion of murder, police and prosecutors said in a statement on Monday.",
        "The 55-year-old is suspected of having knowingly administered high doses of a sedative to two seriously ill patients in intensive care who died as a result, according to the statement.The cardiologist was suspended from Charite in August 2022.Prosecutors initiated an investigation at that time, but an arrest warrant could only be issued upon receipt of a medical report showing that the high doses of sedative had not been medically justifiable, police and prosecutors said.There were a total of four suspicious deaths involving the cardiologist, but only in two cases was it beyond doubt that the medication administered had been unjustifiable, they added.The suspect will appear before a Berlin magistrate later on Monday.
