        "Mansfield boss Nigel Clough admitted it was \u201cdevastating\u201d to not make the play-offs despite winning 2-0 at Colchester on the final day of the season.",
        "The Stags ended up finishing level on 75 points with Salford, who lost 1-0 at Gillingham, but it was the Ammies who claimed seventh spot due to having a better goal difference of one. Carlisle and Bradford both finished one point ahead after drawing on Monday.Riley Harbottle gave Mansfield the lead in first-half stoppage time when he headed home Davis Keillor-Dunn\u2019s free-kick, after Tom Dallison had controversially been penalised for a foul on Will Swan midway inside the Colchester half.And substitute James Gale wrapped up victory in the seventh minute of stoppage time with a low finish from Lucas Akins\u2019 pass but ultimately it was to no avail for the visitors, who were beaten in last season\u2019s play-off final.Clough said: \u201cIt\u2019s devastating. A total of 75 points normally gets you in the play-offs.\u201cWe were keeping an eye on what was going on elsewhere but it wasn\u2019t to be.\u201d",
        "Despite the final-day disappointment though, the former Sheffield United and Derby boss insists there is plenty to build on from this campaign and says he knows what areas they will need to work on for next term.He added: \u201cWe\u2019ve conceded too many silly goals over the course of the season.\u201cWe know exactly where we need to improve.",
        "\u201cThere are absolutely tons of positives for us to take into next season.\u201cTo get to 75 points in a season and to within one goal (of the play-offs) I think is an achievement in itself.\u201cIt gives you so much encouragement when you see what we\u2019ve had to deal with and we just can\u2019t wait to get going again.\u201cIt definitely hurts even more, knowing what we could have achieved with a fully fit squad. To get so close, within one goal, is really tough to take.\u201cWe can\u2019t wait for the first ball to be kicked, next season.\u201dColchester finished 20th in League Two, after Ben Garner successfully led them away from relegation danger.Garner said: \u201cI thought we should have got something from the game.\u201cIt was another pleasing performance against a side who missed out on the play-offs by a goal, in terms of long terms of the game I thought we were the better side.\u201cI\u2019m really pleased with the effort from everyone since I came in through the door.\u201cI think the season is probably finishing at the right time now, in terms of mission accomplished.\u201cWe\u2019ve done what we set out to do when we came in and now we\u2019ve got an opportunity to reshape the squad a little bit, build on the good core players that are here.",
        "\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be where we are in the table, next season \u2013 we want to be pushing for promotion.\u201cLooking at the teams coming in, both from below and dropping down, it\u2019s going to be a really tough league next season so we have to work hard in the summer to make sure we\u2019re in a strong place.\u201d"
