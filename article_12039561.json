        "Texarkana Texas Police Department\u00a0arrested a second man Tuesday and he was resultantly booked into the Bi-State Jail.\u00a0Police believe both Demarco Banks, 20, and Kamauri Butler, 17, are the shooters in the dispute which ultimately led to Matthew Delaney being shot in the chest.\u00a0They announced Sunday shots were fired in a neighborhood west of\u00a0George Dobson Field at Spring Lake Park and an errant round 'travelled about 400 yards and struck the innocent victim at the ball field.'\u00a0Banks and Butler were charged with deadly conduct and\u00a0aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, respectively.ESPN spoke to Delaney's mother, Amy, Tuesday and reported he is in intensive care suffering from partial paralysis in his left leg, two broken vertebrae and a collapsed lung.\u00a0'It's [the lung] slowly inflating,' she said. 'Each day, that's gotten a little better. He still does have a chest tube to try to drain some fluid off it.'\u00a0",

The 18-year-old has received immense support from the community which borders Arkansas.\u00a0'They have been here every day, calling, coming in, the team, the staff,' Amy Delaney said. 'Everyone has reached out. They've sent food to us. They have just been so supportive.\u00a0'We've had three different small businesses that have made donations to Matthew that are just trying to help any way they can. We've had people that we don't even know offered our homes up because we needed a place to stay. The outpouring from the people here in Texarkana has just been amazing and we're just so thankful.'Department spokesman Shawn Vaughn told the Texarkana Gazette it was a case of 'incredibly bad luck, bad place.'\u00a0TAMUT released statements this week confirming the incident, subsequent hospital treatment, the ruling of the game as a no contest, alongside the cancelation of a softball doubleheader Sunday.'The university's counseling services are available to players and other students,' the statement read. 'At this time we ask that you keep our student-athlete, his family, teammates and friends in your prayers.'\u00a0",
