        "Scotland Yard has expressed \u201cregret\u201d over the arrests of six anti-monarchy protesters ahead of the King\u2019s coronation after being threatened with legal action when no charges were brought.",
        "Republic chief executive Graham Smith said a chief inspector and two other Metropolitan Police officers personally apologised to him over what he called a \u201cdisgraceful episode\u201d after they visited him on Monday evening.Prime Minister Rishi Sunak had earlier backed the Met over the dozens of arrests of protesters amid concerns they were cracking down on the right to protest.London Mayor Sadiq Khan requested \u201cfurther clarity\u201d from Scotland Yard, saying that the right to peaceful protest is an integral part of democracy.The Met issued a lengthy defence as it confirmed Mr Smith and five others have been told they face no further action after being stopped at 6.40am on Saturday.The force said it had arrested the group using new powers under the much-criticised Public Order Act after it was believed items found alongside a large number of placards could be used as \u201clock-on devices\u201d to cause disruption.",
        "\u201cThose arrested stated the items would be used to secure their placards, and the investigation has been unable to prove intent to use them to lock on and disrupt the event,\u201d the statement said.\u201cThis evening, all six have had their bail cancelled and no further action will be taken.\u201cWe regret that those six people arrested were unable to join the wider group of protesters in Trafalgar Square and elsewhere on the procession route.\u201d",
        "Mr Smith said the three officers apologised to him at his home in Reading, Berkshire, before handing back the straps for the placards they arrested him over.He told the PA news agency: \u201cThey seemed rather embarrassed, to be honest.\u201cI said for the record I won\u2019t accept the apology. We have a lot of questions to answer and we will be taking action.\u201dScotland Yard said 52 of the 64 arrests made during its coronation operation on Saturday related to concerns individuals were going to disrupt the pageantry.So far, four charges have been brought.The force insisted its action was \u201ctargeted\u201d at those believed to be \u201cintent on taking this action\u201d.\u201cAny suggestion all protest was prohibited is not correct,\u201d it added.The force acknowledged that at least one of the six people arrested while unloading placards from a vehicle in St Martin\u2019s Lane had engaged with its protest liaison team, but said those officers were not present during the arrest.\u201cTaking into account the information that people were seeking to seriously disrupt the event, and the significance of the security operation, officers had been briefed to be extremely vigilant and proactive,\u201d it said.Mr Smith had told PA the speed in which they dropped any action against the group showed officers were aware \u201cthey had made a very serious error of judgment\u201d.",
        "\u201cI\u2019m obviously relieved they dropped it so quickly but very angry they even went down this road, robbing people of their liberty for absolutely no reason,\u201d he said.\u201cThere was no evidence of any ability or intent to commit any offence and they simply decided to arrest us and that is outrageous.\u201dMr Sunak had defended Scotland Yard\u2019s operation and denied officers were acting under pressure from ministers.\u201cThe police are operationally independent of Government, they\u2019ll make these decisions based on what they think is best,\u201d he told broadcasters during a visit to Hertfordshire.\u201cActually, I\u2019m grateful to the police and everyone who played a part in ensuring that this weekend has gone so well, so successfully and so safely, that was an extraordinary effort by so many people and I\u2019m grateful to them for all their hard work.\u201dBut Mr Smith believed officers had \u201cevery intention\u201d of arresting demonstrators and used the straps as a \u201cpre-text\u201d to detain the group under the new powers making locking-on to an object a jailable offence.Labour mayor Mr Khan tweeted: \u201cI\u2019ve requested further clarity from the Met. While it\u2019s vital the police are able to keep us safe, it must be balanced with protecting the right to peaceful protest \u2013 an integral part of democracy.",
        "\u201cLondoners will want swift reassurance any lessons to be learned will be learned.\u201dMr Smith raised fresh concerns about the Public Order Act signed into law last week, which tips the balance against protest, including by lowering the definition of \u201cserious disruption\u201d.Labour was not committing to repealing the act despite harbouring concerns about its use.Ken Marsh, head of the Metropolitan Police Federation representing officers from the rank of constable to chief inspector, said police were acting both lawfully and \u201cimpartially\u201d.\u201cProtesting can take place in this country but it\u2019s the level to which you want to perform that protest that we have to balance and deal with what\u2019s put in front of us impartially. That\u2019s what was done,\u201d he told Today."
