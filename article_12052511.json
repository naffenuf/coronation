        "Comedian Adam Hills said he has mapped out his toilet breaks given the \u201climited availability\u201d at the coronation as well as practising limiting his fluid intake in preparation for the big day.",
        "The host of Channel 4\u2019s The Last Leg, 52, was chosen as part of a group of 14 \u201coutstanding Australians\u201d to join Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in representing the country at the coronation.The eclectic Australian delegation includes post-punk pioneer and Bad Seeds musician Nick Cave and Australian women\u2019s football star Sam Kerr, who currently plays for Chelsea.",
        "Hills explained being asked to attend the coronation was \u201ca bit overwhelming\u201d, but he \u201ccouldn\u2019t say no to any of it\u201d.He told the PA news agency: \u201cI\u2019ve done a little bit of research and studied what\u2019s going on and I\u2019m suddenly realising I\u2019m going to be in Westminster Abbey where coronations have been taking place since 1066.\u201cI\u2019m going to watch the King sit on a chair that was built in the 1300s and I can\u2019t believe I get to witness a piece of history.\u201dHills described attending the Australian High Commissioner\u2019s Residence with the delegation ahead of the coronation.",
        "He said: \u201cThere was a speech yesterday, we were at the High Commissioner\u2019s residence and the Governor General gave a speech and he said \u2018Australians will be seeing the coronation through your eyes\u2019.\u201cIt was a lovely level of responsibility that was placed on our shoulders. It feels like I got the call to represent my country.",
        "\u201cEveryone was a little bit starstruck by Nick Cave,\u201d he said, before adding: \u201cBut the main topic of conversation that I was involved in was planning out our toilet breaks for the day.\u201dHills told PA: \u201cWe need to be there at 7.30 in the morning, we\u2019ve been told that where we check in there are toilets, but that is 600 metres from Westminster Abbey and once once we\u2019re seated, there\u2019s limited toilet availability.\u201cI\u2019ve been doing literal dry runs where I\u2019ve tried to take in as little amount of fluid as possible and space out the caffeine consumption and see how long I can go.\u201cI made it five hours earlier on, I think I\u2019m looking pretty good for tomorrow,\u201d he joked.",
        "The comedian said he was not nervous to attend the coronation, having performed for royalty on several occasions.He said: \u201cI\u2019ve performed in front of the royal family three or four times, that\u2019s nerve racking. I don\u2019t have to do anything tomorrow, I\u2019m just watching, the pressure\u2019s off.\u201dHills added that he would do his \u201clevel best\u201d to take Cave, Kerr and Mr Albanese for dinner at his restaurant in London following the coronation celebrations.",
        "He told PA: \u201cI invested in a restaurant earlier this year in Parsons Green and I love the idea that I can say the phrase \u2018my restaurant\u2019.",
        "\u201cSo I think there\u2019s no better way to end the day attending a coronation than by having a meal in my restaurant.\u201cI\u2019m going to do my level best to bring Nick Cave, Sam Kerr and the Prime Minister along.\u201d"
