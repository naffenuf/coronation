        "Talks on renewing Britain\u2019s business ties with Hong Kong will be held during the first visit to the city by a UK minister since China\u2019s crackdown on its civil rights.",
        "The Government has condemned the national security law imposed by Beijing on the former British territory in 2020 after mass protests.The move strained relations and led to the creation of a visa scheme allowing Hong Kongers to come to Britain.But the UK Government has recently made clear that it wants to maintain engagement with China despite political differences. For future generations we have an obligation to engage \u2013 robustly and also constructively  Investment minister Dominic Johnson  Investment minister Lord Dominic Johnson will discuss boosting trade in fintech and financial services with Hong Kong government representatives.He said he will also stress that the UK will \u201ccall out the violation of their (Hong Kongers\u2019) freedoms and hold China to their international obligations\u201d.It comes after the highly controversial attendance of China\u2019s vice-president Han Zheng, who has been blamed for the curtailment of freedom in the former British territory, at the King\u2019s coronation.The decision to invite Mr Han was strongly criticised by China hawks on the Tory benches and Lord Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong.The Foreign Secretary said he \u201cmade plain\u201d the UK\u2019s position on Hong Kong when he met with the Chinese vice-president in London ahead of the royal event.But James Cleverly argued that the UK must engage directly with China in a recent foreign policy speech, angering some Tory critics of China who want ministers to go further in distancing the UK from Beijing and to be more outspoken in criticising its leadership.",
        "Ahead of his trip, Lord Dominic Johnson said: \u201cHong Kong is one of the world\u2019s leading international finance centres, and my visit will promote cooperation on sectors where we both excel \u2013 from financial services and infrastructure to clean growth and sustainability.\u201cThe UK\u2019s ties with Hong Kong run deep, not only in our shared history and connection between our people, but in business and our desire to succeed. For future generations we have an obligation to engage \u2013 robustly and also constructively \u2013 and our engagement with Hong Kong is an important part of that.\u201cI am clear that we will not look the other way on Hong Kong or duck our historic responsibilities to its people, and that we will continue to stand up for them, call out the violation of their freedoms and hold China to their international obligations.\u201dThe UK says China remains in breach of the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, under which it has a duty to uphold Hong Kong\u2019s high degree of autonomy and rights and freedoms.Hong Kong was handed over from the UK to China in 1997 with a promise by Beijing to keep western-style liberties under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d framework."
