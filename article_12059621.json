        "Walsall leapfrogged Doncaster on the final day with a 2-1 victory at the Poundland Bescot Stadium.",
        "Goals from Conor Wilkinson and Isaac Hutchinson earned Walsall a first win in 10 games as they rose to 16th \u2013 while an 11th loss in 16 pushed Rovers down to 18th despite Bobby Faulkner\u2019s consolation.Walsall should have led inside seven minutes but Matty Stevens steered Tom Knowles\u2019 low cross wide from six yards.Rovers keeper Louis Jones made smart saves from Stevens and Knowles, before the latter headed Liam Gordon\u2019s cross straight at the keeper from six yards.After the break, Stevens lashed wastefully into the side netting and Jones made another fine save after Hutchinson\u2019s 20-yarder took a nick off Stevens\u2019 head.But they finally got the goal their dominance deserved when Wilkinson crashed home Gordon\u2019s 57th-minute cross from eight yards.",
        "It was 2-0 on 74 minutes as Stevens teed up Hutchinson to lash home from an acute angle.Doncaster pulled one back on 84 minutes as Faulkner steered home a fine half-volley from a corner but Walsall held out."
