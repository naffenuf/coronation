        "Environmental protesters have disrupted banking giant Barclays\u2019 annual meeting for shareholders in central London.",
        "A few minutes into the meeting, chairman Nigel Higgins was interrupted by a chorus of singers causing several minutes of disruption.Singing a version of the Spice Girls\u2019 Thank You Very Much, the group sang: \u201cStop right now, no more oil and gas. Stop burning fossil fuels and end this madness.\u201cHey you, burning up the earth\u2026 we\u2019ve had enough.\u201dMr Higgins eventually responded: \u201cObviously we are very happy to hear opinions of what we do but maybe better to wait for the Q&amp;A and have a two-way discussion.\u201dSeveral protesters continued to disgruntle Mr Higgins by standing up and shouting about the bank\u2019s impact on climate change.",
        "One protester shouted: \u201cBarclays funds climate chaos \u2013 people are dying right now. The largest funder of fossil fuels in Europe.\u201dOne protester was carried out of the building for refusing to move, with his shouts drowned out by Barclays\u2019 company secretary Hannah Ellwood, who continued to run through the meeting agenda."
