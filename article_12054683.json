        "Police have said they \u201cunderstand public concern\u201d after officers made 52 arrests throughout the King\u2019s coronation day \u2013 including alleged affray, public nuisance and breach-of-the-peace offences.",
        "The Metropolitan Police came under heavy criticism on Saturday after what campaign groups described as \u201cincredibly alarming\u201d detentions during republican protests.Protesters from the anti-monarchy group, including its chief executive Graham Smith, were apprehended during the day \u2013 as well as demonstrators from Just Stop Oil and Animal Rising.The Met said it received information that protesters were \u201cdetermined to disrupt\u201d the coronation \u2013 including defacing public monuments with paint, breaching barriers and disrupting official movements.But campaigners said the protests were \u201cpeaceful\u201d, describing the arrests as \u201ca dangerous precedent for us as a democratic nation\u201d.The force confirmed reports from Just Stop Oil that 13 demonstrators were detained on the Mall and six public nuisance arrests on St Martin\u2019s Lane following protests from Republic.Three people were also apprehended in Soho, three at Wellington Arch and five on Whitehall on conspiracy to cause public nuisance, with another in Whitehall arrested for religiously aggravated behaviour likely to cause harassment.The Met said a further 14 people were detained in east London on suspicion of conspiracy to cause a public nuisance.",
        "All suspects remain in custody, the force said.Footage from the Mall showed the Just Stop Oil protesters being handcuffed and taken away by a heavy police presence.Animal Rising said a number of its supporters were apprehended on Saturday while at a training session \u201cmiles away from the coronation\u201d.",
        "Nathan McGovern, spokesman for the campaign group, described the arrests as \u201cnothing short of a totalitarian crackdown on free speech and all forms of dissent\u201d.Ms Findlay, who led the policing operation, said: \u201cWe absolutely understand public concern following the arrests we made this morning.\u201cProtest is lawful and it can be disruptive.\u201cWe also have a duty to intervene when protest becomes criminal and may cause serious disruption.\u201dMs Findlay added: \u201cThis depends on the context.\u201cThe coronation is a once in a generation event and that is a key consideration in our assessment. We absolutely understand public concern following the arrests we made this morning  Commander Karen Findlay  \u201cA protest involving large numbers has gone ahead today with police knowledge and no intervention.\u201dHuman Rights Watch labelled the arrests \u201cincredibly alarming\u201d, adding: \u201cThis is something you would expect to see in Moscow, not London.\u201dAmnesty International\u2019s chief executive Sacha Deshmukh also raised concerns after police were reportedly given instructions to apprehend people with megaphones.Separately, Westminster Council cabinet member for communities and public protection Aicha Less said she was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d over reports of arrests of members of its Night Star volunteer team, who assist vulnerable people on the streets late at night.\u201cWe are working with the Metropolitan Police to establish exactly what happened, and in the meantime, we are in touch with our volunteers to ensure they are receiving the support they need,\u201d she said.",
        "The Met said they received intelligence that people wanted to disrupt the coronation by using rape alarms to disrupt the procession, and arrested three people in the Soho area on suspicion of conspiracy to commit public nuisance.Outside London, hundreds of people joined a march through Cardiff city centre in protest against the monarchy as the King was crowned.Demonstrators walking down Queen Street shouted \u201cDown with the Crown, not my King\u201d and \u201cGod save the poor\u201d.Nick Wall, member of campaign group Republic and chairman of the Labour For Republic organisation, addressed crowds at a Not My King rally in Cardiff where he called the arrests of protesters in London \u201cdisgraceful\u201d.On Wednesday, the Met said it would have an \u201cextremely low threshold\u201d for protests during the coronation celebrations, and that demonstrators could expect \u201cswift action\u201d.Under the controversial new Public Order Act, protesters who have an object with the intention of using it to \u201clock on\u201d are liable to a fine, with those who block roads facing 12 months in prison.Critics previously hit out at plans from the Met to use facial recognition software on crowds to assist their policing operations."
