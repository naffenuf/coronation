        "The UK Independence Party (Ukip) has been wiped out at England\u2019s local elections, losing all six seats it was defending.",
        "The pro-Brexit party lost two councillors in Folkestone &amp; Hythe, one in South Staffordshire, one in Tamworth, one in Tendring and one in Bournemouth, Christchurch &amp; Poole.It points to a sharp decline in Ukip\u2019s political fortunes since it won the largest share of the vote of any party at the 2014 European elections.",
        "Ukip\u2019s rise contributed to then-prime minister David Cameron\u2019s decision to announce a referendum on EU membership.But the party\u2019s influence has dwindled since Nigel Farage stepped down as leader in 2016.Ukip, now led by former Tory MP Neil Hamilton, has no MPs in the House of Commons.In a video posted on Twitter, Ukip\u2019s deputy leader Rebecca Jane said: \u201cI\u2019m not disheartened today. The results were expected.\u201dAnother right-wing party, Reform UK, also had a poor showing in the local elections, failing to gain any seats despite fielding nearly 500 candidates.It lost half its councillors, retaining eight.Reform, which has no MPs and was previously called the Brexit Party, mainly targeted wards that heavily voted Leave in the 2016 referendum.Its leader Richard Tice told the Telegraph on Friday that Reform had \u201cchanged the course of numerous seats\u201d at the Conservatives\u2019 expense.The former MEP had previously vowed to ensure the Tories \u201cnever have a majority government again\u201d."
