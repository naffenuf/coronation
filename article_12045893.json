        "The hashtag dogsatpollingstations was back with a vengeance this morning - with images shared of patient pooches waiting for their owners.Polls have opened across England, with Rishi Sunak set to face his first major electoral test since entering No10 just over six months ago.The Prime Minister predicted a 'hard night' for his party at the local elections, but said that the Conservatives were now moving away from 'box set drama' politics.The local elections are also likely to be the final set of polls before the next general election, with the results expected to give an indication of whether Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer could be on course for Downing Street.Among those sharing tweets for the trending hashtag were those reminding voters to bring photo identification as this is the first election where ID is compulsory.Annette Hill, from Weston-super-Mare, made her dog Ruby her own photo ID, complete with name, photo, and an 'authorised signature' of a paw print."
