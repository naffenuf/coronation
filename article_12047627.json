        "A man left paralysed from the waist down after being tasered by a police constable exited the courtroom after the officer told a jury he discharged the Taser believing the alleged victim was going to attack him.",
        "Pc Imran Mahmood, 36, is accused of unlawfully inflicting grievous bodily harm on Jordan Walker-Brown during a patrol in the early months of the first lockdown on May 4 2020.His alleged victim, who was 23 at the time, was left with \u201ccatastrophic\u201d injuries after hitting his head on the pavement and breaking his back.He had not pulled out a weapon and presented no \u201cphysical threat\u201d to anyone at the time he was tasered, prosecutors told Southwark Crown Court.Jurors heard Mahmood \u2013 attached to the Met\u2019s territorial support group (TSG) which deals with outbreaks of public disorder \u2013 chased Mr Walker-Brown on foot after noticing him walking along the pavement on Burgoyne Road, Haringey, north London. I have been living like this for three years and it has been really hard for me. It has affected me massively, not only myself - my family. I was just trying to do my job  Pc Imran Mahmood  Mahmood was said to have drawn his Taser when Mr Walker-Brown jumped onto a wheelie bin to climb over a fence in the front garden of a house, creating such an electric shock that it caused the latter man to tumble backwards over the fence, land head-first on the footpath below and break his back.",
        "Giving evidence on Thursday on the anniversary of the incident, Mahmood told jurors he discharged his Taser after Mr Walker-Brown \u201cturned around\u201d on top of the bins, \u201chonestly\u201d believing the younger man was in possession of a weapon and going to \u201cattack\u201d him.Mr Walker-Brown left the courtroom in his wheelchair, returning later.The court heard it was the \u201cfirst time\u201d Mahmood had discharged his Taser on duty.The officer teared up and wiped his eyes while telling jurors that the incident has affected him \u201cmassively\u201d.\u201cI have been living like this for three years and it has been really hard for me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has affected me massively, not only myself \u2013 my family. I was just trying to do my job.\u201dMahmood added that he \u201cabsolutely\u201d did not intend the result and tried to direct his comments to the alleged victim and his family in the back of the courtroom.He told the jury he and his TSG colleagues were in the Haringey area after learning the borough was experiencing \u201csignificant problems\u201d with knife crime, knifepoint robberies and drug dealing as well as recent murders and stabbings.The officer went through factors that \u201cheightened\u201d his \u201csuspicion\u201d of Mr Walker-Brown, including his clothing which showed no obvious \u201cpurpose\u201d for being out during lockdown, him wearing a bum bag \u2013 which Mahmood claimed was \u201coften\u201d used to conceal weapons or drugs \u2013 and displaying an \u201coh shit expression\u201d when he saw the police van.",
        "Mahmood also said Mr Walker-Brown took off when he and his colleagues stepped out the carrier and reached for his waistband while running, increasing the officer\u2019s suspicion.Jurors went on to hear that when Mr Walker-Brown jumped into the front courtyard of a property, all the factors arousing suspicion made Mahmood think \u201che has got a knife\u201d and needs to be \u201ccontained\u201d.\u201cIt makes me think he could turn around and attack at any point,\u201d Mahmood added.Mr Walker-Brown ignored warnings from Mahmood that he had a taser, the court heard.The officer said the \u201cfinal prompt\u201d to discharge the taser was when Mr Walker-Brown was \u201cmoving towards\u201d him.In a prepared statement to the police watchdog, Mahmood said: \u201cI distinctly remember Mr Walker-Brown looking at me as he was jumping up onto the bins, his facial expression wasn\u2019t one of giving up but that of aggressive determination.\u201dGiving evidence, he said: \u201cI saw that imminent threat. I thought Mr Walker-Brown was in possession of a weapon.\u201dMahmood told jurors he believed Mr Walker-Brown would have fallen onto the bins, denied anticipating serious injury and denied anticipating the end result.The officer, from Plaistow in east London, does not dispute inflicting grievous bodily harm but denies that it was unlawful.The trial continues on Thursday with cross-examination of Mahmood."
