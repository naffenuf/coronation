        "MIAMI (AP) - Atlanta Braves slugger Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr. was removed from Thursday's 6-3 win over the Miami Marlins out of precaution after he fouled a ball off his left knee in the sixth inning, just three days after he was removed against the New York Mets with a bruised left shoulder.",
        "Acu\u00f1a was on the ground for a while grabbing at his left leg, but finished the four-pitch at bat and returned to right field in the bottom of the sixth.Atlanta manager Brian Snitker said after the game that Acu\u00f1a is \"fine,\" but was having trouble bending his knee, so the club wanted to get him treatment right away.\"You hit a ball off your knee, it's gonna hurt ... but he's gonna be fine,\" Snitker said.He was then replaced by Sam Hilliard, who went to center field, and centerfielder Kevin Pillar took Acu\u00f1a's place in right field.Acu\u00f1a was removed from the second game of Monday\u00b4s doubleheader against the Mets with a bruised left shoulder after getting hit by a 93 mph fastball from Tylor Megill.",
        "Leading off the game, Acu\u00f1a was drilled with an 0-2 pitch. He sat on the ground for a bit holding his shoulder in obvious pain while receiving attention from an athletic trainer.Acu\u00f1a was 1 for 3 Thursday and stole his MLB-leading 15th base of the season. He's batting .355, the third-best mark in the major leagues.___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"
