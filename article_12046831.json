        "Students at\u00a0Rossmoyne Senior High School in Perth filmed the heartwarming moment they presented outdoor education teacher Hayden Forlonge with his gift.In a video posted to TikTok, the teacher is initially standing facing the whiteboard in the classroom as a group of students cluster behind him, ready to present him with his 'dream surfboard'.'We wanted to get you something to show our appreciation for you,' one student says.\u00a0The camera pans back to the group of students carrying a surfboard inside a board bag before they tell him to turn around.The teacher is gobsmacked as he approaches the students, saying: 'guys, you didn't have to do this'.As he moves to open the bag, he cannot believe it and steps back, asking: 'there's not something inside?''There is something inside,' says one of the students. 'Do you think we just got you a board bag?'He looks inside before placing his hands over his face in disbelief.The video then shows him spinning the board around, which is believed to be an El Tomo board costing around $1,000.He then thanks the pupils, telling them: 'I think the best thing about that is that the next time I'm in the water I'll think about you guys every time and remember you as officially the best class I've ever had.'"
