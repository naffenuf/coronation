        "The Anchor Hythe retirement scheme resident is looking forward to the King\u2019s coronation but said she does not think it will be \u201csuch a grand affair as it was for our Queen\u201d.Speaking about her memory of watching the ceremony as a child all those years ago, she said: \u201cI was very proud because my parents loved the royal family and that resonated down through to us children.\u201cAt school we all received a lovely blue coronation glass given to us by Southampton Town Council, which I still have now, before the event so there was a lot of excitement in the community.\u201d",
        "Asked what her advice would be to the King, she said: \u201cI would say to Charles, \u2018Remember what a wonderful woman your mother was, and you must follow in her footsteps\u2019.\u201cThe way she carried herself, the way she behaved and her whole demeanour.\u201cShe committed herself to our country and our Commonwealth right until the day she died, and I would expect that sort of commitment and passion from our King.\u201d",
        " His mother was a terrific example, but he must now put his own marker on things  Terry Burton, retirement scheme location manager  Terry Burton, who met Charles while working as a teacher in Frome, Somerset, praised the royal for being \u201cvery good at making people feel at ease\u201d and described him as \u201cengaging\u201d.The 65-year-old, who now works as a location manager at Hanover Gardens retirement home, said he is looking forward to the \u201cpageantry\u201d on Saturday, adding that he wishes Charles well as King.He said: \u201cIt\u2019s a different world to June 1953 and the Queen\u2019s coronation. He will have many challenges. Some people question why we should give such patronage to one man, one family, but I believe the royal family are an asset to the country. He certainly has waited a long time to take the reins.\u201dWhile he said the late Queen set a great example, he added that the King can \u201cput his own marker on things\u201d.He said: \u201cThere will be plenty of people who will want to trip him up, but I say don\u2019t rise to the bait. His mother was a terrific example, but he must now put his own marker on things.\u201d",
        "Other care home residents offered snippets of advice for the new King, including 99-year-old Eric Deacon who said he must \u201cbe a good diplomat\u201d, and Mary Huke, 89, who said she hopes he can \u201ckeep up the friendly, relaxed attitude\u201d.",

The celebrations will be a chance for us all to reflect on fond moments and create new joyful memories with loved ones that go beyond a single day.\u201d"
