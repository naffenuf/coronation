        "The mastermind behind the \u201clargest ever multi-location UK drone show\u201d said pulling off the Coronation Concert spectacle was a \u201cnerve-wracking but exciting\u201d experience.",
        "Patrick O\u2019Mahony, founder and director of Skymagic, said 1,000 drones took part in the light shows over Windsor Castle, Cardiff Bay and the Eden Project in Cornwall on Sunday.The lights of the drones formed shapes celebrating the King\u2019s love of the natural world, including a blue whale which appeared in the sky above Windsor during the concert.",
        "Artists including Lionel Richie, Katy Perry and Take That performed as part of a star-studded line-up.The Department for Culture, Media and Sport hailed the \u201cspectacular scenes\u201d, saying it was the \u201clargest ever multi-location UK drone show\u201d.When US singer Perry, 38, walked out singing the opening lyrics to her hit Roar, a drone projection of a lion\u2019s head appeared in the sky above her.And when British-Moroccan singer Zak Abel sang the Simple Minds hit Don\u2019t You Forget About Me, a drone scene of a Prince Charles clematis flower appeared in the sky over Windsor, followed by a giant multi-coloured butterfly.Speaking on Monday, Mr O\u2019Mahony told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cIt was the biggest single performance across multi sites we\u2019ve ever done, so to try and co-ordinate it all from one central location in Windsor and trigger three shows all at the same time, all with obviously not rehearsing, giving the game away in advance, it was a quite nerve-wracking but exciting evening really.\u201d",
        "He said they had rehearsed at a \u201csecret location up in Yorkshire\u201d so as not to spoil the surprise.On how many drones were involved, he said: \u201cIt was 1,000 across all three sites, so the biggest show we\u2019ve done like that.\u201dHe said three operators were needed to run the entire fleet, one per site.",
        "Mr O\u2019Mahony added: \u201cEach individual drone has its own little mission loaded onto it and we have then one operator and a back-up operator who triggers that show sequence and sends the drones up.\u201cAnd then in effect we, at the right, very precise time, press the \u2018go\u2019 button and each little drone then flies its own individual mission.\u201cNo one drone knows where the other drones are in the fleet so they\u2019re not talking, they\u2019re all individual in terms of that movement, they fly the entire routine and luckily come back home at the end of it.\u201cWhen we have the final file, our pilot then uploads that to all the drones but each individual drone has its own separate file attached to it.\u201d",
        "On whether anything went wrong, he added: \u201cNo, we had a perfect run.\u201cThe weather was great, which was always a big relief for us, and then each individual site all their fleets went up, came down and we were bang on time across locations which was really wonderful to see.",
        "\u201cWe can fly in light rain, if it was very, very heavy rain then that would stop us, the same with very high winds. But normally we can fly in most conditions.\u201dThe concert was watched by an average audience of 10.1 million, according to overnight figures from the BBC.The event was hosted by actor Hugh Bonneville and featured a cameo from The Muppet characters Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy, as well as a recorded video message to Charles from Top Gun star Tom Cruise."
