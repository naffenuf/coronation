        "Oakland Athletics broadcaster Glen Kuiper has been suspended after uttering what sounded like a racial slur while describing a trip to the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum.",
        "NBC Sports California said in a statement Saturday that Kuiper will remain off the air until a review of what happened during Friday night's broadcast is completed.In a pregame segment on NBC Sports California before the A\u00b4s played the Kansas City Royals on Friday night, Kuiper talked about a trip to the museum with colleague Dallas Braden but seemingly mispronounced the word \"negro,\" making it sound instead like a slur.Later in the game, Kuiper apologized on the air without getting into specifics, saying he said something that \"didn\u00b4t come out quite the way I wanted it to.\"\"I could not be more sorry and horrified by what I said,\" Kuiper said Saturday in a statement released by NBC Sports California. \"I hope you will accept my sincerest apologies.\"Bob Kendrick, the president of the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum, issued a statement about Kuiper on Twitter on Saturday.\"I\u00b4m aware of the unfortunate slur made by Glen Kuiper,\" Kendrick said. \"I welcomed Glen to the NLBM yesterday and know he was genuinely excited to be here. The word is painful and has no place in our society. And while I don\u00b4t pretend to know Glen\u00b4s heart I do know that my heart is one of forgiveness. I hope all of you will find it in yourselves to do the same!\"",
        "The A\u00b4s later issued a statement Friday night, calling the language used by Kuiper \"unacceptable.\"Kuiper has been calling A\u00b4s games in the Bay Area for about 20 years. He is the younger brother of former major leaguer and Giants announcer Duane Kuiper.Radio announcers Johnny Doskow and Vince Controneo will rotate as play-by-play announcers during Kuiper's absence.___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"
