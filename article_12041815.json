Welfare and Recreation) lip-syncing contest in 2017, while deployed on the USS Ronald Reagan, and became a regular in the competitions, according to NBC News.The officer insists she never experienced harassment in the Navy, but when she was scheduled to perform at a diversity, equity and inclusion event at Langley Joint Air Force Base in the summer of 2022, it 'caused an uproar to many conservatives and Christian extremists.'",
