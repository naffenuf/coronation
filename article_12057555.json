        "Harry Kane scored the only goal in Tottenham's 1-0 win against Crystal PalaceThe effort saw Kane moved into second in the Premier League scoring chartsKane now has over 40 per cent of Tottenham's goals during a difficult campaign\u00a0For Harry Kane another season is ending as it began. Scoring goals to win games, knocking down records and dutifully preserving Tottenham\u2019s flame of hope.",
        "He just keeps doing what he does. Refusing to be distracted as Spurs lurch from one crisis to another. Or as Erling Haaland rolls into English football, firing in his goals at a rate not seen in this country for decades.Carry on Harry, reliable as ever. He has scored 26 of Tottenham\u2019s 64 Premier League goals this season, a shade over 40 per cent and a greater share of his club\u2019s total than ever before, including his best return of 30 goals of 74 in 2017-18.Where would they be without him? The answer may be near and yet Kane continues with the same supreme focus.\u2018On to the next one,\u2019 he replied with a knowing smile, aware how predictably dull it must all sound while enjoying the list of assorted milestones passed with Saturday\u2019s winner against Crystal Palace.",
        "The goal eased him clear of Wayne Rooney into second place in the Premier League\u2019s all-time scoring charts, although he remains 51 behind Alan Shearer. There were others, too, including a new record set for 10 headers scored in one season in the competition.\u2018Of course, these are great as we always say, special achievements,\u2019 Kane told the club\u2019s in-house channel. \u2018It\u2019s hard to think about them during the season but to go second in the all-time list above Wayne is something I\u2019m extremely proud of.\u2019",
        "His steely focus is quite ominous for Daniel Levy. When Kane fixes his eyes on something, he holds his gaze, does not blink, and he appears determined not to extend the contract that will run out next year.Available on a free, Kane could select his next club from any in the world. Tottenham, meanwhile, must keep working to change his mind.With such an uncertain future, it seemed vital in the short term to end a rotten sequence of results.This they did with the help of Ryan Mason\u2019s tactical tweak, enabled by Emerson Royal\u2019s return to fitness, which released Pedro Porro from his defensive responsibilities.It was Porro who crossed for Kane\u2019s goal, a header at the back post in first-half stoppage time.\u2018It was a perfect ball and I timed my header well,\u2019 said Kane. \u2018It was important to bounce back, show some desire and determination. A 1-0 win always feels good, builds momentum.\u2019TOTTENHAM (4-4-2): Forster 6; Royal 7, Romero 7.5, Lenglet 7 (Dier 88min), Davies 7; Porro 7.5, Skipp 6, Hojbjerg 6, Son 6.5 (Danjuma 89); Richarlison 6.5 (Kulusevski 79), KANE 8.
