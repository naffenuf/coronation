I've loved her for ages, you know how much I like her.'Junaid seems willing to help, responding: 'I know how much she means to you so I will do everything in my power to try and get you two back on track. For me, I do want to see you two both together.\u00a0",
        "'You did make a stupid mistake but you know that and I'm not going to be the one to rub it in your face.\u00a0'This is the first step to getting Dani back. You need to graft. Dani Imbert, the one that you love, loves roses.'Fans are therefore left to imagine that Roman will be arranging a romantic surprise filled with flowers for his love.\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile, Jordan and Sophie go from strength to strength as they discuss their upcoming move, and are babies on the horizon?Elsewhere, Harry catches his mum up on the Thailand drama and ponders over his kiss with Junaid - could there be something between the pair?",

        "They walked hand in hand before Roman wrapped his arm around Dani as they made their way home.Earlier in March, The Sun revealed the pair had locked lips and were an item as the TOWIE cast travelled to Thailand for filming.A source told The Sun: 'Friendship turned into romance when they were away in Thailand. Everyone knows they're a couple now.",
        "'It's actually very sweet and feels like it was meant to be all along.'\u00a0Previously, Dani dated co-star Liam Gatsby and was branded a 'f***ing joke' by her new beau Roman before he furiously stormed off.\u00a0Following the fall out, Roman and Dani had a heart to heart but tempers flared once again after he asked her: 'Have you said to me before you're not happy with Gatsby'.\u00a0Tearful Dani replied: 'Maybe I've confided in you a bit too much. Maybe it's insecurity, whatever.'\u00a0Roman was left angry once again and told Dani to: 'Crack on with your fake relationship, yeah. You're a f***ing joke.'Dani and Liam later went separate ways as she\u00a0revealed that she and Roman spent the night together and shared a kiss.The pair denied any\u00a0romantic connection, but their co-stars speculated if they were more than just friends.\u00a0The Only Way Is Essex\u00a0airs Sunday at 9pm on ITVBE and ITVX."
