I wasn't sure how this day will be. He would have been one years old and possibly taking his first step.'I still have questions on why?? He was a perfect baby and the autopsy report came back with no conclusion.",

Life goes on... and you learn to deal with grief in different ways...'At the time of her loss\u00a0Vander shared the sad news on Instagram.\u00a0'Yesterday was the hardest day of my life.

        "'Instead of delivering a baby, I get to go home with a memory box\u2026 I do not wish this on anyone.''What was a regular weekly checkup turned into a nightmare that I never imagine will happen to me,' she went on.'Given I share my pregnancies in the show I knew I'll have to post about this and avoid the \"when is your due date\" question. You will always be in our heart baby Mason.'\u00a0",
