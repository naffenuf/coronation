        "A Government probe into partygate investigator Sue Gray\u2019s switch to a senior Labour role has been paused after she refused to co-operate.",
        "Some Tories reacted angrily after an update into her departure from her high-ranking Whitehall position to become Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s chief of staff did not say whether she had broken rules, as had been suggested by several reports.Others criticised the Government\u2019s statement as a \u201cpolitical stunt\u201d, as allies defended Ms Gray for prioritising a separate review by the anti-corruption watchdog. Ms Gray was given the opportunity to make representations as part of this process but chose not to do so  Oliver Dowden  In a written statement to the House of Commons on Tuesday, Cabinet Office minister Oliver Dowden said the Government will \u201cconsider next steps\u201d after Ms Gray \u201cchose not to\u201d speak to the investigation.It was launched following concerns that she had engaged with the opposition while looking into allegations of parties being held in Downing Street during pandemic lockdowns.The Government has submitted a \u201cconfidential assessment\u201d to the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba), which will \u201cconsider evidence from a range of sources to make a recommendation on any appropriate restrictions on the appointment\u201d, Mr Dowden said.",
        "The watchdog can set recommendations for when senior people leave government, including calling for a cooling-off period between three months and two years to avoid any conflict of interest.",
        "Mr Dowden noted that under Civil Service guidance, any contact between senior civil servants and leading members of opposition parties should be cleared by ministers.But he stopped short of saying whether the Cabinet Office deemed her to have broken rules.The Deputy Prime Minister said: \u201cIn order to maintain confidentiality towards an individual former employee, I am unable at this stage to provide further information relating to the departure of Ms Gray whilst we consider next steps.\u201dSir Tony Blair\u2019s former chief of staff described the statement as a \u201cpolitical stunt\u201d following briefing to the press that the inquiry would find Ms Gray had breached the Civil Service Code.Jonathan Powell, who left the diplomatic service to work for the former prime minister, told BBC Two\u2019s Newsnight: \u201cWe were briefed all day yesterday and today it was going to be full of these sins committed by Sue Gray and there\u2019s been absolutely nothing in it at all.\u201cI think today has really been a complete diversion and the real thing is Acoba.\u201dDave Penman, leader of the FDA union which represents senior Whitehall staff, said Ms Gray \u201chas the right\u201d to prioritise Acoba\u2019s deliberations and stressed that she is no longer a civil servant.Calling the statement a \u201cdamp squib\u201d, he told Times Radio: \u201cAcoba is really the real deal when it comes to this and who\u2019s going to make a decision. And it really should be, because it isn\u2019t doing it for political ends.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s doing it based on evidence, and I can understand why she\u2019d prioritise that.\u201dA Labour source told the PA news agency: \u201cSue Gray has fully co-operated with the Acoba process and is awaiting their outcome. They are the designated channel in cases like this.\u201dOnce the watchdog makes its recommendation, Rishi Sunak will make the final ruling, though neither he nor the committee have the power to block an appointment.Former Acoba chairwoman Baroness Angela Browning said she would be \u201cvery surprised\u201d if a prime minister challenged the advice, a move that would trigger \u201can almighty row\u201d.",
        "The failure of the Whitehall inquiry\u2019s outcome to materialise came after intense negotiations between Cabinet Secretary Simon Case and Tory ministers, the Guardian reported.The paper said that Mr Case, who initially backed the release of findings critical of Ms Gray\u2019s departure, blocked the plans amid concerns over publishing a politically-charged report into a former official just days before the local elections when the Government is meant to observe \u201cpurdah\u201d rules on political impartiality.After the Government update, Tory MP Mark Jenkinson tweeted: \u201cWhen Sue Gray was in the Propriety and Ethics Team, how might she have reacted to someone who failed to comply with her investigations?\u201cWhat might she have said about \u2018Partygate\u2019 witnesses if they\u2019d declined her offer of a chat?\u201d",
        "Sir Keir earlier insisted he was \u201cconfident\u201d Ms Gray had not broken any rules.The Labour leader said he \u201chad no discussions with her while she was investigating Boris Johnson whatsoever, I don\u2019t think anyone is suggesting that\u2019s the case\u201d."
