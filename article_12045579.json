        "Royal Mail added that the most northerly coronation-themed street is to be found at Coronation Place in Castletown, Thurso, while the most southerly is Coronation Road in Redruth, Cornwall.In the UK, it said there are 1,148 street names featuring King and some 805 referencing Queen, while Charles gets 681 uses.There are also 1,398 UK houses featuring the term Crown, while 438 include King, and 347 refer to Coronation, it said.",
        "Of the 4,333 regal-related road names in the country, most are in London, followed by Leeds, Bristol and Birmingham.Street names including the word King are the most common nationwide, accounting for slightly more than 27% of the total, with Queen in second with around 18% of usage, Royal Mail said.",
        "Royal Mail\u2019s director of external affairs and policy David Gold said: \u201cAs the country gears up for a weekend of celebrations and street parties, postmen and women will be delivering parcels and letters to thousands of regally named residences.\u201cPerhaps it is an indication of the close bond between the public and the royal family that so many of the places we live have that royal connection.\u201d"
