        "Ipswich missed out on the League One title but manager Kieran McKenna hailed his team\u2019s \u201cincredible\u201d season after a final-game 2-2 draw at Fleetwood.",
        "Substitutes Freddie Ladapo and Marcus Harness took runners-up Town\u2019s final league goal tally to 101 and a 19th game unbeaten.But a second-half double from one-time Ipswich academy product Jack Marriott denied the visitors a chance to rack up a century of points.Ladapo and Harness scored either side of Marriott\u2019s brace while Town finished with 10 men after Harry Clarke\u2019s stoppage-time dismissal for his second booking.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t our best performance and we didn\u2019t hit the levels we did across the large majority of the season,\u201d said McKenna.\u201cWe finished at home with a 6-0 (win over Exeter) which was such a wonderful day, probably the best day in a lot of the players\u2019 lives.",
        "\u201cWe wanted to hit those levels again but the players are only human.\u201cThey and the staff work so hard and train to levels of intensity and professionalism that are really high.\u201cThat is why performances have been at the consistent levels they have been.\u201cWe didn\u2019t have that same edge and intensity this week for obvious reasons.\u201cWhen we don\u2019t we aren\u2019t such a good team. It was a little reminder for everyone going into next season that what separates us is the intensity and focus that we work with day to day.\u201cThat\u2019s what we need to do many times over next year. But I have great pride in the season.",
        "\u201cWe wanted to finish it off with a win but there is still an awful lot to be pleased about.\u201cIt has been an incredible season in so many ways on and off the pitch. Everyone can take the next week to enjoy that.\u201cBut after that we will be already starting to refocus for next season to be as ready as we can be.\u201dFleetwood\u2019s point saw them finish 13th, drawing both games with promoted Town.\u201cWe need to make sure we push towards the play-offs (next season),\u201d said manager Scott Brown. \u201cOr as far up the league as we possibly can.\u201cOur budget won\u2019t be anywhere near some of the teams in this league. But the chairman has ambition so I think we all must dream high.\u201cOver the two games against Ipswich we competed really well against a team who has been promoted.\u201cWe knew they would come here expecting to win. But we didn\u2019t worry about them and our performance typified our season.\u201cThere was no pressure on us so we could go and show our talent and compete.\u201d"
