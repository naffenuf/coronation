        "CAIRO, May 7 (Reuters) - Syria called on Sunday for Arab states to show \"mutual respect\", after the Arab League voted to readmit it following more than a decade of estrangement over the Syrian civil war.",
        "Arab states should pursue \"an effective approach based on mutual respect\", the Syrian foreign ministry said in a statement that also stressed the \"importance of joint work and dialogue to undertake the challenges facing Arab countries\".Arab League foreign ministers voted to readmit Syria earlier on Sunday, in a major step towards normalisation. Its membership was suspended in 2011, the year its ongoing civil war began. (Reporting by Kinda Makieh and Nayera Abdallah; Writing by Hatem Maher Editing by Peter Graff)"
