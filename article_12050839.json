These activities help to encourage them to display natural behaviours and keep their minds active.'The cream teas are of course fun for us to see, but also present food in a new way for them all, so they had to investigate, explore, and seek out their food, much like the effect of giving your dog a treat ball or a snuffle mat.'",
