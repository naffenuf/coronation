After Will Smith (0-2) intentionally walked Mike Trout, Neto advanced to third when Trout was forced out at second on Shohei Ohtani's grounder.

Ezequiel Duran was hit by a pitch and Leody Taveras walked to begin the inning.

Taveras scored when Nathaniel Lowe reached first on a throwing error by shortstop Neto.Lowe hit a two-out RBI single in the eighth to make it 4-0. The inning was prolonged by a throwing error by third baseman Anthony Rendon.\"We did many good things, but you have to get 27 outs and we couldn\u00b4t do it,\" Rangers manager Bruce Bochy said. \"It's another one that we did let get away.
