        "Noda's hit accidentally went straight back at Yarbrough and hit him on the head, with the pitcher falling to his knees before his teammates ran over to check on him.Medics soon followed and were pictured holding a towel to his head, seemingly to stifle any bleeding.They helped the dazed 31-year-old back to his feet and escorted him from the field and away for further assessments. The crowd of shocked spectators applauded him off the field.The incident happened at the top of the sixth inning with the Royals leading the A's 2-1.",
        "Speaking after the game, Royals manager Matt Quatraro said: 'It was scary. I mean the dugout went silent.'Luckily when we got out there he was talking and aware of what was going on. As far as how he's doing, he's alert and they've taken him to get some testing.'It was otherwise shaping up to be a good day for the Royals, who are last in the five-time American League Central tier.They eventually recorded a 5-1 win over the A's to take their record to 9-26 while the A's are last in AL West, 8-27.The Royals have four games with the Chicago White Sox next and three against the MIlwaukee Brewers.\u00a0Yarbrough will surely be unavailable for the White Sox series and depending on the subsequent diagnosis, probably the next three against the Brewers as well."
