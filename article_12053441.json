They said GOOD, then she hung up and called the police,' Zyburt said.Following DeMay's tragic death, the FBI warned parents and caregivers of increasing incidents of sextortion among young children and teenagers.",
        "'Sextortion begins when an adult contacts a minor over any online platform used to meet and communicate, such as a game, app, or social media account,' the FBI said.'In a scheme that has recently become more prevalent, the predator (posing as a young girl) uses deception and manipulation to convince a young male, usually 14 to 17 years old, to engage in explicit activity over video, which is then secretly recorded by the predator.'",
        "'The predator then reveals that they have made the recordings and attempts to extort the victim for money to prevent them from being posted online.'An obituary dedicated to the teenager has described DeMay as someone who loved athletics and sports including baseball, football and basketball.'Jordan was a compassionate, mature, and team oriented player who once described his goal to \"be the best I can be as a person on and off the field\", the obit read.'He was a determined young man, who after being sidelined for a year with a serious knee injury, made a decision to rehab himself and made plans to attend college.'The teenager, who leaves behind four sisters, his parents and his grandparents, was planning to study Athletic Training at college.'Jordan possessed a great personality, loved and was very devoted to his family, especially his sisters who simply adored him,' the obituary read.'He enjoyed going to the beach, being in, on, or near the water, and was talented to the point of doing well on many of the things he attempted. He will be remembered for his great smile, fluffy hair, great personality, and ability to inspire others.'For confidential help, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 or click here.\u00a0"
