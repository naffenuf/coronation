        "Land for more than 2700 homes across two sites in regional South Australia will be released to help ease demand for housing.",
        "The state government has unlocked access to the land at Goolwa North, on the Fleurieu Peninsula and at Fisherman Bay on Yorke Peninsula.Re-zoning of the land for housing is subject to community and stakeholder engagement but the government expects first construction to start in early 2025.\"We are fast-tracking land supply across the state to boost much-needed supply and tackle the regional housing crisis,\" Housing Minister Nick Champion said.\"Both these sites present an opportunity to deliver nearly 3000 new homes in areas of growing demand, backed by good infrastructure and amenities.\"The Goolwa North site could deliver about 2500 homes on 241 hectares of privately-held land in an area with limited opportunity for development.The proposal will boost housing affordability and choice amid rising demand, with the region's population expected to grow by 20 per cent by 2036.The Fisherman Bay site could deliver about 230 homes on a 26-hectare site on the coastal fringes north of the township."
