        "CORONATION LIVEBLOG: Click here to follow live updates throughout today\u00a0Thousands of royal fans across the four corners of the UK today braved the rain to celebrate King Charles III's historic Coronation.",
        "Huge crowds draped themselves in reds, whites and blues as they gathered around big screens and street parties in London, Cardiff, Edinburgh and Belfast to commemorate the moment the monarch was crowned in an ancient ceremony stretching back a thousand years.As the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby placed St Edward's Crown on Charles' head, there was a deafening cry of 'God Save the King' in Hyde Park followed by applause and cheers as thousands of royal fans were overcome with emotion.Michelle Roycroft, from London, was one of the first people to make it to the railings in front of Buckingham Palace ahead of the balcony appearance from the royal family.\u00a0She had been waiting since 7am and said standing in the rain was fine. Speaking about her experience of watching the balcony moment and the flypast, she said: 'I'm absolutely blown away... made my day. The most memorable, magical day.'However, those who headed to Glasgow Cathedral to watch King Charles III being crowed were left gutted when TV screens cut out. Just seconds before the crown was placed on Charles\u2019 head, there was a huge technical blunder and screens went blank.\u00a0",
        "People had travelled from across the Central Belt of Scotland to take shelter from the rain and when the screen went blank those inside frantically grabbed mobiles phones out of their pockets and bags as they desperately tried to tune-in to watch the historic moment online.",
        "Glasgow City Council, who organised the viewing event, apologised and added that it was out of their control.Speaking to the Daily Record, Ellen Gandrud, 21, who is from Minnesota in the States but is now a student at the University of Glasgow, says she was left gutted at missing the most important part of the event.She added: 'It couldn't have happened at a worse time, right at the crowning. At the most important part of the whole thing it started to glitch.'I couldn't tell if it was the internet here or streaming everywhere - and then I went on my phone and it was perfect. A lot of those in the crowd were very disappointed.'On the lawn of Rochester Castle in Kent there were no such problems. A\u00a0funfair, face painting stall and stilt walkers could be seen, as families enjoyed picnics under umbrellas.In Birmingham's Centenary Square, the drizzle also failed to dampen anyone's enthusiasm, with a local named Angel remarking: 'It's amazing to see; especially to have something here in the city as people want to watch and not everyone can get to London. I've come dressed up for it. I bought what I'm wearing from New Look - I'm a big Royalist.'Meanwhile in Cardiff, a crowd of 500 fans gathered at the castle to watch the coronation on a huge TV screen before a 21-gun salute rang out from the walls. One mother, Rhiannon Rees, told MailOnline: 'People's spirits were high - it's what the country needs after the last few years.'\u00a0",
        "Bride-to-be Eloise Downer, 26, is having her hen night in Cardiff.\u00a0Eloise, from Portsmouth, left the city's bars to head for Cardiff Castle where they watched a live screening of the coronation.\u00a0Eloise, who is marrying police office Dougie Young in July said: 'I'll always remember my hen party - there was a brilliant atmosphere in the castle.'\u00a0",
        "Martin Viney flew from Australia with his wife to watch the coronation and arrived on the Mall at 5am.\u00a0He said: 'Historical things like this only happen once in a while. As soon as my wife and I heard the coronation was happening we booked flights. It's an eye-opening event. It's so different to any other event.'People in a grandstand in front of Buckingham Palace erupted into cheers after an announcement that 'coronation day is here', at about 8.30am. The stand has about 3,800 seats for veterans, NHS staff, social care workers and representatives of charitable organisations with links to the royal family.\u00a0Crowds standing on either side of the Mall burst into chants of 'hip hip hooray, and campers had been singing and chanting since Friday.\u00a0A Mexican wave started half way down the road, and Charles-themed \u00a31 million notes were handed out to the crowd.\u00a0Linda Old came to look at Buckingham Palace after watching the coronation in Hyde Park.\u00a0She said that the ceremony brought back memories of other royal events, most recently the Queen's funeral when she camped overnight to see the late Queen lying in state.\u00a0",
        "Ms Old, from Islington, north London, said: 'It has been very well organised. I was emotional watching it. I've come with my family. Just being here with everybody is special. We all stood up for God Save the King. It's special, there's a lot of memories.'In Trafalgar Square, artist Gideon Summerfield, 28, was sketching the procession route. He was one of three alumni of the Royal Drawing School tasked with recording the event.\u00a0Mr Summerfield, drawing with chalk and pastels, said his fellow artists were stationed at Buckingham Palace and Westminster Abbey. He said: 'It is such a massive honour. 'It's incredibly lucky to be able to capture such an historic moment. It's great for a young artist to be able to capture it.\u00a0I'm totally indebted to the Royal Drawing School for the opportunity.'\u00a0He said the King had helped to establish the school about 20 years ago.\u00a0But the wet weather started to take its toll on well-wishers, with flocks of people leaving before Queen Consort Camilla was crowned.In the stillness of the abbey, Mr Welby held St Edward's Crown high above Charles and, placing it on his head, said 'God save the King' - words repeated by the congregation.A fanfare was played and the abbey's bells rang for two minutes after the crowning, with gun salutes fired from nearby Horse Guards Parade, the Tower of London and saluting stations across the nation and from warships at sea.",
        "In a change, the controversial 'Homage of the People' element of the service has been toned down after there was widespread criticism of the new element.Among around 500 people who gathered in Birmingham's Centenary Square to watch the ceremony on a big screen was a 69-year-old woman who was born in the late Queen's coronation year.Mrs Arthur added: 'It's a piece of history. We just thought to would be lovely for Alicia to remember and look back on the photos.'Radha Patel, 36, had brought her two-year-old daughter Marissa and husband Krunal to watch on a giant screen in Manchester. The dentist said: 'It's a momentous day. We wanted to watch as it's history in the making. It's very exciting 'Petra Hirte, 56, had travelled with friends from Berlin in Germany for a music festival in Manchester. And they arrived in Piccadilly Gardens to watch the Coronation with hats and flags. Petra said: 'We don't have anything like this in Germany so it's fascinating. It's amazing for to watch all this. We are all royal fans.'This is a great weekend for us with the music festival and all this. It was a surprise for us as when we booked it, the Queen was still alive.'Fans soon started to get beers from a specially set up bar in the cordoned off area of the city centre. Builder Mark Harris, 34, said: 'I've come to toast the King and soak up the atmosphere of the day. I won't see this very often. I'm pleased for Charles and think he'll be good for the country but he's got a tough act to follow.'",
        "It turned into a traditional British occasion as well-wishers travelled to Windsor from around the world - to be met by persistent downpours throughout the day.Hardy revellers refused to allow the weather to dampen their spirits as they celebrated the Coronation of King Charles III in the historic Royal town.Many braved the elements to stand out for hours in the Long Walk leading to Windsor Castle as the heavens opened while the ceremony was broadcast on big screens.They included one five-year-old boy called Tim - who was sporting face paint with a Union Flag and a crown on top.",

        "Things almost went pear-shaped at Sandringham House, after a 30\u00a0metre square mobile screen that was supposed to be switched on from 8.30am failed to start up.\u00a0A problem with the hydraulics meant it could not be raised into position in the parkland and there were hours of worry for fans.\u00a0The crowd of around 3,000 people cheered with relief as problem was finally fixed at 10.55am when the erected screen flickered into life showing King Charles walking into Westminster Abbey.",
        "Back at The Mall, cries of God Save the King rang out from the thousands gathered there who, despite being soaked by a downpour, were as enthusiastic as ever.\u00a0Those unable to see over the heads of spectators in prime front row positions held up smart phones above their head to try and capture the hold carriage containing King Charles and Queen Camilla.The sheer spectacle of so many military band marching bands left many of those in the crowd awestruck.'It makes you proud to be British' said Stephen Kennedy.

There were so many of us in the room sat round looking at the nine-inch television.'It was a double celebration at the Royal Deeside estate for Bjorg Jonsdottir, from Iceland, whose first grandson, as yet unnamed, was born in the early hours of the morning.A special range of memorabilia and photographs relating to the royal's Scottish visits was also exhibited in the castle's ballroom.Among the scores of people at Glasgow Cathedral to watch the ceremony on screens around the historic building was US tourist Kathy Kowalski.The 74-year-old, from St Mary's County, Maryland, said: \"We're on a tour of Scotland and Ireland so we decided to come here to see the cathedral and it so happened they were showing the coronation.\"I like watching it but being an American it's like 'couldn't you have spent that money helping someone else, helping the poor?
