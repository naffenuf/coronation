        "Indigenous Aussies wrote to King CharlesCalling for an apology for colonialisation\u00a0High-profile Indigenous Australians have joined leaders across the Commonwealth urging King Charles III to formally apologise for the effects of colonisation.",
        "Ahead of the King's coronation, representatives from 12 countries have written a joint letter calling for reparations, acknowledging the impact of slavery, along with returning the remains of Indigenous people and cultural artefacts.The letter has been written ahead of the Coronation of King Charles III at Westminster Abbey, in London, on Saturday.\u00a0Australian signatories of the letter include Nova Peris, the first Indigenous woman elected to federal parliament.Co-chair of the Australian Republican Movement, fellow ARM co-chair Craig Foster and Victorian independent senator Lidia Thorpe are among the signatories as well.'We stand united in engaging a process to right the wrongs of the past and to continue the process of decolonisation,' the letter said.'We, the undersigned, call on the British monarch King Charles III, on the date of his coronation being May 6, 2023, to acknowledge the horrific impacts on and legacy of genocide and colonisation of the Indigenous and enslaved peoples.'",
        "Countries represented in the joint letter include New Zealand, the Bahamas, Canada, Papua New Guinea, Jamaica and Saint Lucia.The letter called for the King to start the conversation about 'slavery's enduring impact', as well as 'immediately commit to starting discussions about reparations for the oppression of our peoples'.Senator Thorpe said the effects of British colonisation on Indigenous people were still being felt.",
        "'The genocidal project that commenced in 1788 still continues, and neither the British Crown nor the Australian government have been held to account for the crimes they have committed,' she said.'This country has a new king. The parliament and the prime minister are subjugated to someone we didn't elect. We don't need a new king, we need a head of state chosen by the people.'The letter coincides with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese confirming he had invited the monarch to visit Australia.Mr Albanese described his private audience with the King at Buckingham Palace on Tuesday, local time, as 'very warm'.'I appreciated the discussion that we had and that King Charles has a great love for and affection for Australia,' Mr Albanese told reporters while visiting Barrow-in-Furness in northern England on Wednesday.'It comes from his time as a student there, but also his many visits to Australia.'",
        "While he is a republican, the prime minister said he was looking forward to being at the monarch's coronation ceremony on Saturday.He said the King was 'very familiar with the range of issues that Australia is facing'.Mr Albanese is among a contingent of Australians invited to the coronation, along with Governor-General David Hurley and state governors.The Australian delegation includes Matildas captain and soccer star Sam Kerr, singer Nick Cave, Aboriginal artist Jasmine Coe, comedian Adam Hills and London-based nurse Emily Regan.",
        "The King, who is the monarch of 14 overseas realms including Australia, will host a lunch for prime ministers and governors-general at Buckingham Palace and also attend a Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting on Friday, the day before his crowning.On Sunday, Australia's Federation Guard will fire a national 21-gun salute from the Parliament House forecourt, followed by a Royal Australian Air Force fly-past."
