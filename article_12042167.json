Part Two is an action-packed, epic, war movie,' Villeneuve stated.\u00a0'It is much more dense. We went to all new locations... I didn\u2019t want a feeling of repetition. It\u2019s all new sets. Everything is new... This time, it's full IMAX.'Additionally, many fans were disappointed when Zendaya was only in the last few minutes of the film.Villeneuve has promised that Zendaya, as well as the other characters, will be much more prominent in part two.\u00a0'There are some characters that are less developed that I'm keeping for the second film \u2014 that's the way I found the equilibrium,' Villeneuve told the LA Times in 2021.\u00a0'We tried in [Dune: Part 1] to stay as close as possible to Paul's experience. Then, in the second one, I will have time to develop some characters that were left aside a little bit. That's the theory. I hope it will work.'"
