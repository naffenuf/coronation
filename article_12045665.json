'They are a good side and have performed well this season.'We dominated a lot of the first half and they had counter-attacks but then they grew into the second half.'It's becoming a bit of a pattern. We haven't been able to sustain our good starts. It's something we probably need to look at.'It reflects where we are in the league and what we have to play for left.\u00a0'It's not where we want to be and that's as a club as players, staff and fans.\u00a0'We want to be in title races at this stage of the season or in genuine top four races. We're not in that right now and that might be why the mood is a little low.'",
