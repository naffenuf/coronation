        "Australian tradie ran into burning building in Bali\u00a0He and other tourists save the clothing shop's stock\u00a0An Australian tourist visiting Bali who heroically ran into a burning building in just his shorts has fronted a press conference casually sipping his beer.",
        "Jack Bach, 30, from Frankston in Melbourne was determined to not let the limelight interfere with his holiday as he answered questions about risking his life for locals when he came across the fire at a shopping strip.\u00a0\u00a0'We saw the Balinese ladies and children crying and they were about to lose all their stuff so we thought we better do what we can,' Mr Bach told 7 News on Monday, beer in hand.",
        "He went back inside the burning clothing store about 20 times and, along with half a dozen other tourists, managed to save most of the stock by dragging it outside.The concreter by trade then went next door where an art gallery looked set to catch alight and successfully saved a number of paintings.The blaze broke out on Saturday afternoon, not long after Mr Bach and his travel mate, Nathan Garrard, touched down in the Indonesian holiday hotspot.The roof of the shopping strip eventually collapsed as locals tried to douse the flames with hoses.Firefighters arrived shortly after and brought the blaze under control.The inferno was sparked by an electrical fault in a residence located above the shops.Fortunately no-one was injured and Mr Bach and Mr Garrard are now enjoying the rest of their holiday."
