        "Leicester have not kept a clean sheet in the Premier League since November\u00a0John Terry spoke with the defence and quickly backed\u00a0Caglar Soyuncu for recall\u00a0The Foxes travel to Fulham on Monday night seeking to earn a crucial victory\u00a0John Terry spent most of his career trying to ensure Chelsea finished first rather than second but he now finds himself facing a task even tougher than winning major trophies.",
        "The former England captain is attempting to tighten one of the leakiest defences in the Premier League and, in doing so, keep Leicester in the top flight. The Foxes have four games to save themselves, starting at Fulham on Monday.Though Leicester\u2019s form has improved since boss Dean Smith, Terry and Craig Shakespeare joined in April, they cannot keep the back door shut. They have let in 59 goals this term and have not kept a clean sheet since November.Terry has held individual discussions with all the defenders and quickly backed Caglar Soyuncu \u2014 effectively cast aside by former manager Brendan Rodgers \u2014 for an immediate recall.\u2018If we keep four clean sheets until the end of the season, we\u2019re safe,\u2019 said Smith. \u2018I fully believe we\u2019ve got players that can score goals, so we would win some of those games.",
        "\u2018We\u2019ve got to make sure that we don\u2019t keep giving away mistakes for goals. We\u2019ve spoken about it \u2014 it is a concern.\u2019Whether they stay up or go down, Leicester are at the end of an era, with eight players out of contract this summer\u2018I\u2019ve felt from the players that they care for the club and understand the need to keep it in the Premier League,\u2019 insisted Smith. \u2018It\u2019s very important and it\u2019s been reflected in the performances, too.\u2019",
        "Leicester (probable, 4-2-3-1): Iversen; Castagne, Faes, Soyuncu, Kristensen; Ndidi, Soumare; Maddison, Tielemans, Barnes; Vardy."
