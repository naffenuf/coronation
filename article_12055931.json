        "A gallant and gutsy performance from John Ryder was not enough to beat Mexican fighter Saul \u2018Canelo\u2019 Alvarez in front of more than 50,000 people in Guadalajara, Mexico.",
        "A bruised and bloodied Ryder lost by unanimous decision in a heroic effort against one of the world\u2019s best fighters at Akron Stadium.The judges scored the fight 120-107 on one card and 118-109 on the other two to improve Canelo\u2019s record to 59-2-2 in his first fight in his homeland since 2011.Both fighters used the first two rounds to feel each other before a Canelo jab caused blood to pour from Ryder\u2019s nose.Canelo then knocked down Ryder with a clean one-two in the fifth round and it looked ominous for the 34-year-old from Islington.But he got back up and fought through the 12 rounds, coping vicious punches throughout the fight while spitting blood from his mouth but held on until the last bell.Ryder had previously lost five career fights to Billy Joe Saunders, Nick Blackwell, Jack Arnfield, Rocky Fielding, and the most recent being Callum Smith in 2019 by unanimous decision.The loss ended his four-fight win streak with his record now sitting at 32-6."
