        "The actress\u00a0portrays Crossroads star Noele Gordon in the miniseries\u00a0and the show is set to be released sometime this year.",
        "Gushing about her role, Helena has previously said: 'When I read the script, it was like a gift. A dream. It's like meeting someone and falling in love.'I watched Crossroads. So I knew Noele Gordon as a figure, but I hadn't really taken on board the sacking.'The three-part miniseries, penned by Russell T Davies, will explore the all-powerful reign and fall from grace of the inimitable Noele, who died in 1985.Noele was declared the 'Queen of the Midlands' thanks to iconic role as Meg Mortimer in Crossroads and was the darling of the establishment until it turned on her.As flame-haired widow Meg in the long-running soap opera Crossroads, Noele became one of the most famous people in Britain.Then in 1981, at the height of the show's success and the peak of her fame, she was axed without ceremony, without warning and with no explanation, with the soap eventually ending two years later.With the boss's words 'all good things must come to an end' ringing in her ears, Noele found herself thrown out of the show that was her life for over 18 years.A love letter to a legend of television, and to the madcap soap she starred in, Nolly will be an entertaining ride through Noele's most tumultuous years, and a sharp, affectionate and heart-breaking portrait of a forgotten icon."
