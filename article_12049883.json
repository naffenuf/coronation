        "This past November she joyfully announced that she was expecting another little bundle of joy, who arrived this week.Devon went public with her latest pregnancy by posting a breathtaking black and white snap in which she posed topless with Enzo in her arms.Her blossoming baby bump was on full display as she shot the camera a knowing smile, her one-year-old grinning in her arms.'Someone\u2019s becoming a big sister!' the St. Louis native crowed in her caption. 'So excited to announce we are expecting baby #2 next year!'",
        "A few months after she welcomed Enzo, she gave an interview to the Daily Front Row reflecting on the impact that motherhood had on her.'It\u2019s been a roller coaster of change, but definitely all for the better!' she told the publication. 'We named her Enzo Elodie; I\u2019ve always loved masculine names for girls, and I wanted something strong and unique for her.'Becoming a mother, she gushed, 'feels amazing! I have wanted to be a mother my whole life. I loved to babysit, play with dolls, and it\u2019s always been a natural instinct for me to take care of people. Enzo has exceeded all my expectations.'When her interviewer brought up the prospect of expanding her family, Devon replied: 'Yes! I would love more kids! I don\u2019t think right away, though.'",
        "In the same interview Devon revealed that she gave Enzo the French middle name Elodie because she and her husband 'fell in love in Paris, so it seemed fitting.'That piece of family history might also be connected to why Devon and Jonathan decided to give their newborn the French name Celine.During her first pregnancy, Devon told A Pea In The Pod that she had 'learned to go with the flow and to not stress too much about body changes or other things changing in my life. I want to embrace the change and this new time.'She rhapsodized that 'I love having a baby bump! I also love to feel her moving and kicking inside me,' while acknowledging: 'The low points would just be the minor things such as back pains and acid reflux.'As far as pregnancy fashion was concerned, she confessed: 'I honestly have been trying to avoid maternity clothes for as long as possible.'To that end, she said: 'I\u2019ve been wearing flowy piece and lots of workout leggings.... But overall, I have tried to maintain the same style.'"
