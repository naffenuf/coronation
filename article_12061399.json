        "Martin Keown thinks Arsenal and Liverpool won't be able to afford Declan Rice\u00a0The England star has attracted the eyes of a number of Premier League clubsThe Hammers are prepared to sell Rice for a fee of around \u00a3100m this summerMartin Keown believes Declan Rice will be too expensive for Arsenal and has even priced the West Ham star out of Liverpool's reach, too.",
        "Rice is expected to leave the London Stadium this summer, having recently rejected a new deal at the club and is at the top of a number of club's shopping lists ahead of next season.\u00a0The England midfielder has attracted interest from Chelsea, Manchester United, Liverpool and Arsenal, with the Hammers putting a price tag of around \u00a3100m on his head.\u00a0However, Keown believes that two of those clubs - former side Arsenal and Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool - would struggle to meet West Ham's valuation.\u00a0\u00a0\u2018I think Declan Rice is going to be too expensive for Arsenal, quite frankly,\u2019 Keown told talkSPORT.\u00a0",
        "\u2018I think he will be too expensive for Liverpool as well who have been in the Champions League now for a number of years.\u00a0'He\u2019s a player Arsenal will like but not with those costs involved, I think it\u2019s too much. Looking at Arsenal\u2019s business, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a route they will go down.'I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve got the money, even though the Champions League will bring some more revenue. I don\u2019t see him as a player Arsenal can afford to buy.\u2019Arsenal are in the market for a midfielder, having failed to capture Brighton's Moises\u00a0 Caciedo in January, and have been heavily linked in making a move for Rice in the summer.\u00a0",
        "While Liverpool's biggest issues this season have come from midfield and are also looking to add new faces in the department, especially after pulling out of the race for Jude Bellingham.\u00a0Former Gunners defender Keown believes West Ham will have to cash-in on the prized asset, and at price that may beyond his old club.\u00a0He added:\u00a0\u2018I\u2019m sure Arsenal will be interested but there\u2019s going to be a transfer fee isn\u2019t there and it will be enormous.'West Ham will want to cash in as he runs down his contract. They need to do the right business and take advantage of him.",
        "'Rice has helped to keep them in the Premier League so he\u2019s done his side of the bargain.\u2019The Hammers captain starred as West Ham defeated Manchester United 1-0 in the Premier League on Sunday, a result that saw them go seven points clear of the bottom three.\u00a0With Premier League survival almost secured, Rice will turn his attention to West Ham's European campaign this week, as they travel to the Netherlands to face AZ Alkmaar in the semi-finals of the Europa Conference League.\u00a0If the East London side can overcome the Dutch team, then they could find themselves in a European final against either Fiorentina or Basel.\u00a0\u00a0"
