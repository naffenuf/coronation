        "Frank Lampard has praised the good intentions of Chelsea owner Todd Boehly and challenged his players to take the club\u2019s first step into the future over the final weeks of the season.",
        "Defeat at Bournemouth on Saturday will see Chelsea slip below Gary O\u2019Neil\u2019s side, who have battled relegation for most of the season, and they could fall as low as 14th.Boehly, who has spent almost \u00a3600million on signings in the 12 months since buying the club, said this week that he and the hierarchy \u201cvery much believe we\u2019re going to figure it out\u201d after the team slumped to a sixth consecutive defeat \u2013 and possibly their most incoherent \u2013 against Arsenal.It leaves Chelsea yet to break the 40-point barrier with five games to play, and on course to record their lowest Premier League finish in 29 years.Lampard\u2019s team need one more goal to avoid matching the club\u2019s all-time lowest tally in a league season, 31, a record which has stood since 1924. The team are still 15 goals short of the club\u2019s lowest return for a Premier League season.Despite the damning statistics, Lampard said he has seen signs of positivity from the owners since he took over as interim manager a month ago.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing to speak so positively,\u201d he said of Boehly\u2019s comments. \u201cIt\u2019s what I\u2019ve found since I\u2019ve been here, good intentions on where the club is going to be taken.\u201cThat\u2019s good, and then from my point of view I\u2019m working with the squad to try and get some turnaround in terms of feeling, performance and then results. It\u2019s up to the owners of the club to take those bigger decisions.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s not for me to talk about (a vision for the club). I\u2019m here until the end of the season. I don\u2019t think my vision at this point is for me to answer.\u201dChelsea still have to face three of the top four on the run-in as Lampard looks to mastermind the team\u2019s first win in any competition since March 11. The club have had three managers since that 3-1 victory against Leicester, and scored only four goals in nine games.",
        "The 3-1 loss at the Emirates was as dismal as anything in what has been a hugely disappointing first season under Boehly, with the spirit amongst the squad seemingly at rock bottom as they sink down the table.Lampard said: \u201cAll we can say in this period \u2013 everybody from the outside wants to say there\u2019s not much on it (the run-in)\u2026.but for myself and for the players we have to show an immense amount of pride in what we do in the games. It\u2019s the first step into the future.\u201cWill we need a reboot of some sense in the summer? Sure. That\u2019s clear because we\u2019re not where we want to be.\u201cBut at the moment we have to do what\u2019s right in front of us, and the fans you can be sure from my point of view will be pushing for that. I hope they can see the rewards of that, whatever they are.\u201d",
        "Chelsea have long since dropped out of the race for the Europa League and Conference League, meaning they are facing a first season without European competition since 2016/17 and for only the second time in 26 years.Lampard added: \u201cIt\u2019s not for me to sit on and feel hurt by too much. It\u2019s more what\u2019s the action that\u2019s going to get us out of it. The action this season is not going to get us in the Champions League or in the top eight.\u201cWho knows where it might get, it\u2019ll be like the first small step. You have to consider it in that period. Not all fans want to hear that, but it\u2019s a reality which I\u2019ve come back into.\u201cEvery situation is different. I\u2019m the third manager, maybe fourth. You can see from that that it\u2019s been a tough season all round.\u201d"
