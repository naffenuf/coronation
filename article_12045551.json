Then she started having problems swallowing her food.",

        "In a statement released shortly after her death, Tony and Colette wrote: 'Sadly our special angel Rosie, our much-loved daughter and sister, went to Heaven at 2.50 this morning at home where she was surrounded by her loving family.'Rosie was just 14 years old and fought a lifelong battle with Rett syndrome. Throughout her life she brought so much love and happiness to all our family and everyone who knew and met her.''She was such a strong little girl and an inspiration to us all. We shall cherish for ever the memories we have shared and the love she showed us each and every day of her life.The couple concluded: 'As a family we are heartbroken but we are blessed to have had her in our lives.'Coleen had been on holiday in Barbados with her younger brothers, Joe and Anthony, but cut short the trip when she heard that Rosie's condition had deteriorated."
