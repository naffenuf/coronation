Purely because of the family. Because you know what you're doing, how you're doing it, when you're doing it.'They've never asked me to go back in again, not once, mate!'When asked about how things ended for his character, the actor added: '(It was) the worst outro ever ... I didn't even leave at the end of the episode.",
        "'You know you leave and you get the \"duff duff\"? Mine, I went to Norwich to be a bellboy at a hotel and mid-scene just walked in The Vic, went, \"See you later\", turned back to Phil, come to me and I'd gone.'What? That was it? No \"duff duff\". I was there five years and not one \"duff duff\"!'",
        "Myleene also reflected on difficult moments within her career, including alleging that Sir Elton sent her pop group Hear'Say sympathy flowers after making a rude comment about the band.She said: 'We got sent flowers from Elton John who said we were the ugliest band in pop.'He realised, \"maybe I shouldn't have said that\". He sent \"sorry\" flowers to us... I look back at that time, it was a different time in history.'I'm A Celebrity... South Africa continues at 9pm on ITV1 and ITVX on Monday."
