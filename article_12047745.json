'I didn't take the vaccine, period. I never denied that.'\u00a0",

        "The former president got his first shot August 13, 2022 and the second one came October 14, 2022.His daughter received the first dose July 24, 2022 and got the second shot August 13, 2022.The bogus shots would have been administered at the Municipal Health Center in Duque de Caxias.The Federal Police said the vaccine data was entered into the system December 21 by Duque de Caxias municipal secretary Jo\u00e3o de Souza. The vaccine records were removed December 27.Bolsonaro and his daughter flew to the United States on December 30, a day before his presidential term ended.\u00a0De Souza was among the six people apprehended Wednesday."
