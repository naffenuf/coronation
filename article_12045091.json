        "Western Australia will spend an extra $21 million to continue aviation schemes that help residents in regional areas beat sky-high airfares and climate change.",
        "The state government funding, to be included in May's state budget, will help remote Indigenous communities with aviation services during extreme weather, such as floods.It is also expected to help thousands of people access capped airfares for travel to and from Perth, often for health treatment only available in the city.Transport Minister Rita Saffioti says the government's support for regional airlines was highlighted during the Kimberley floods in January.\"Our subsidised services on the Broome to Derby route provided a critical transport link to the region while roads were closed,\" she said on Thursday.More than 66,000 flights were undertaken using capped fares in the first six months of the program.A total of $25.9 million has been allotted for aviation initiatives for regional communities, including freight delivery services.This includes $800,000 to continue a weekly return service on the Kununurra-Halls Creek-Balgo route for four years.The upcoming budget also includes $750,000 to carry out a study and investment plan for 34 airstrips in remote communities to ensure they can handle increased rainfall and flooding due to climate change.\"As we've seen with recent severe weather, aviation plays a critical role in accessing communities, and we want to make sure the airstrips in remote Aboriginal communities are able to withstand the impacts of future severe weather events,\" Ms Saffioti said.",
        "The funding also includes $2.3 million to seal the Warmun Community airstrip in the East Kimberley, which will ensure flights - including emergency medical evacuations - are able to land and take off in wet weather."
