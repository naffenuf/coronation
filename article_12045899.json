        "Southern Brave captain Anya Shrubsole predicts women\u2019s cricket is on a path to full professionalisation within a few years.",
        "The former England bowler took six for 46 against India to steer her side to a thrilling nine-run World Cup victory in front of a sold-out Lord\u2019s in 2017, arguably the most memorable moment in her impressive 14-year international career.The women\u2019s game has accelerated exponentially since then, particularly with the debut of The Hundred in 2021 and, this year, the inaugural Women\u2019s Premier League in India.\u201cThe professionalism is the biggest change,\u201d Shrubsole told the PA news agency.",
        "\u201cPreviously you would only be a professional cricketer if you played for England, and then apart from that it was semi-professional, almost a hobby, but you\u2019re asking these players to train as if they\u2019re professional.\u201cSo to have the eight regional teams all with a minimum of 10 professionals, you add the England girls to that, that\u2019s 100 professional female cricketers in this country, all in the last three years, which is just incredible really in such a short space of time and that will keep growing.\u201cI think it will probably only be a couple of years until we see a fully professional squad across all the regional teams. That\u2019s the thing that\u2019s been the real big difference.\u201dThe two-time World Cup and Ashes winner, 31, stepped down from international duty in April 2022 after earning 173 caps for England across all formats and taking 227 wickets.",
        "The pace bowler still plays domestically for Berkshire, Southern Vipers in the Rachael Heyhoe Flint trophy as a player-coach, and is set to skipper Southern Brave in The Hundred for a third straight season.Last Saturday saw a world record crowd for a women\u2019s international rugby fixture, 58,498, turn out to watch the Red Roses at Twickenham, two days before Arsenal played their Women\u2019s Champions League semi-final in front of a sold-out 60,063 at the Emirates \u2013 a record audience for a women\u2019s club match in England.On Wednesday, it was announced this month\u2019s women\u2019s FA Cup final will be played in front of a sold-out Wembley for the first time.Cricket looks to be the next to benefit from the trend driving people to box offices for women\u2019s sport in unprecedented numbers.",
        "More than 66,000 tickets have been snapped up for England women\u2019s fixtures in 2023, already exceeding the total attendance for all 2022 matches, while sales for July\u2019s Ashes have already surpassed figures for the previous two women\u2019s series against Australia combined.The series finale at Taunton is already sold out, with England hoping to secure the trophy for the first time since 2014.Shrubsole said: \u201cYes, you look at the record number of ticket sales but that\u2019s at big grounds as well that England women haven\u2019t played at for a long time.",
        "\u201cThe Test match at Trent Bridge, playing at the Oval, playing at Lord\u2019s, the girls are really looking forward to that opportunity to show what they can do on the big stage. I think it will probably only be a couple of years until we see a fully professional squad across all the regional teams. That's the thing that's been the real big difference  Anya Shrubsole  \u201cIt\u2019s going to be really hard fought. It\u2019s obviously an England team that\u2019s probably still transitioning a little bit in certain areas, obviously a new coach that\u2019s only been in the role six months, quite a young but very exciting bowling attack. They\u2019re going to have to be at their best.\u201dECB organisers hope the Ashes enthusiasm spills over to The Hundred when its third season opens on August 1.This is the first year the hugely popular women\u2019s Hundred implemented a draft like the men\u2019s competition \u2013 something Shrubsole, who was relieved to find herself back in a Brave uniform, agreed was another step forward.She said: \u201cI think where women\u2019s cricket is going, how much it\u2019s grown, all of those kind of things are just incredible.\u201cTo be in a position to be able to do a draft for the women\u2019s Hundred, to be able to do an auction for the WPL, it\u2019s really incredible and it adds a different dimension. It\u2019s all really exciting.\u201d"
