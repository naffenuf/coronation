        "Carrie Fisher received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on Tuesday \u2013 a May the Fourth tribute to a beloved Star Wars actress who had a touch of stardust.",
        "The late star\u2019s daughter, Billie Lourd, wearing her mother\u2019s portrait printed on her metallic dress, accepted the star on behalf of Fisher. She threw glitter, her mother\u2019s favourite, on the newly unveiled star.\u201cMy mom used to say you weren\u2019t actually famous until you became a Pez dispenser. Well, people eat candy out of her neck every day.\u201cI say you aren\u2019t actually famous until you get a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame,\u201d she said. \u201cMy mom is a double-whammy \u2014 a Pez dispenser and has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame now. Mama, you\u2019ve made it.\u201dMark Hamill, who played Fisher\u2019s space brother, Luke Skywalker, was also on hand, and recalled meeting the young actress when she was just 19.\u201cShe played such a crucial role in my personal and professional life and both would have been far emptier without her.\u201cWas she a handful? Was she high-maintenance? No doubt. But everything would have been drabber and less interesting if she hadn\u2019t been the friend that she was,\u201d Hamill said.Several in the crowd were dressed as characters from the space franchise and C-3P0 and R2-D2 were present for the unveiling. \u201cNever forget the droids,\u201d Lourd said on a wet day that gave way to sun.",
        "Fisher, who died in 2016, joins \u201cStar Wars\u201d co-stars Harrison Ford and Hamill on the Hollywood tourist attraction that recognises luminaries from film, television, music and other entertainment industries.The trio\u2019s stars are all located on the 6,800 block of Hollywood Boulevard, near where the original film debuted in 1977.Fisher played Leia Organa, who over six films morphed from a princess to a general leading the forces of good in its fight against oppressive regimes aiming to control a galaxy far, far away.\u201cNo one will ever be as hot or as cool as Princess Leia,\u201d said Lourd. \u201cLeia is more than just a character.\u201cShe\u2019s a feeling. She is strength. She is grace. She is wit. She is femininity at its finest. She knows what she wants and gets it. She doesn\u2019t need anyone to rescue her because she rescues herself and even rescues the rescuers.\u201cAnd no one could have played her like my mother.\u201dFans had long campaigned for her to receive a Walk of Fame star. The honour comes on May the Fourth, essentially an official holiday for Star Wars fans that\u2019s a play on a line that Fisher said often in the films: \u201cMay the Force be with you.\u201dDevotees worldwide celebrate with a variety of tributes, while retailers hold special sales on Star Wars merchandise.",
        "Fisher was given the 2,754th star on the Walk of Fame. Ford received his star in 2003 and Hamill was similarly honoured in 2018.Walk of Fame stars are given to performers who are nominated and a 75,000 US dollar (\u00a360,000) fee is now required to create the star and maintain it."
