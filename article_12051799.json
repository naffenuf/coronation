        "The Foreign Secretary said he broached areas of \u201cdeep disagreement\u201d during a meeting with the Chinese vice-president in London.",
        "James Cleverly said he \u201cmade plain\u201d the UK\u2019s position on Hong Kong, Xinjiang and Taiwan during talks on Friday with Han Zheng ahead of the coronation.The Chinese politician, who has been blamed for overseeing a crackdown on freedom in Hong Kong, was recently appointed as President Xi Jinping\u2019s deputy and is set to represent China at the royal event on Saturday.Conservative MPs have criticised the UK Government\u2019s decision to invite Mr Han due to his previous role in Hong Kong.It also comes at a time of increasingly fractious relations between London and Beijing, with a vocal section of Tory backbenchers calling for the UK to become more hawkish towards China due to security concerns.Ministers updated the UK\u2019s integrated review on foreign and defence policy in March, describing China under Communist Party rule as representing an \u201cepoch-defining and systemic challenge\u201d to almost every aspect of Government policy and the everyday lives of British people.Mr Cleverly, writing on Twitter on Friday, said: \u201cEngagement with China means discussing areas of deep disagreement and vital co-operation.\u201cToday with VP Han Zheng, I made plain the UK\u2019s views on Hong Kong, Xinjiang and Taiwan.\u201cWe also discussed working together on climate change, economic ties and people-to-people links.\u201dThe Foreign Secretary has taken a less harsh line with China than some in his party would like.",
        "In a speech last month, the Cabinet minister said isolating China would be a \u201csign of weakness\u201d.But some senior Tories want ministers to go further in distancing the UK from China and want the Government to be more outspoken in criticising the Far East country\u2019s leadership.Former leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith is among those to have criticised the invitation for Mr Han to attend the Westminster Abbey service.",
        "The vice-president led Hong Kong affairs for Beijing between 2018 and March this year, during which time it imposed the national security law after mass protests in the city, stifling opposition and criminalising dissent.The move strained relations with the UK and led to the creation of a visa scheme allowing Hongkongers to come to Britain.The UK has said China remains in breach of the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, under which it has a duty to uphold Hong Kong\u2019s high degree of autonomy and rights and freedoms.Hong Kong was handed over from the UK to China in 1997 with a promise by Beijing to keep Western-style liberties under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d framework.On Taiwan, there are international fears that China could look to take the self-governed island by force.Taiwan and China split in 1949 following a civil war that ended with the Communist Party in control of the mainland.",
        "The island has never been part of the People\u2019s Republic of China, but Beijing says it must unite with the mainland, by force if necessary.In Xinjiang, there has been international condemnation of human rights abuses against the Uyghur people, with some being kept in mass incarceration camps.Beijing describes them as re-education centres for the Muslim minority people.Human rights charity Amnesty International said the UK\u2019s decision to invite Mr Han to Charles\u2019 crowning sent a \u201cvery dangerous message\u201d as it called for ministers to hold the senior Chinese figure \u201caccountable for his role in the brutal crackdown\u201d in Hong Kong.Sacha Deshmukh, chief executive of the charity\u2019s UK arm, said: \u201cThe invitation to Han Zheng risks sending the very dangerous message that the UK is prepared to prioritise the financial rewards that come from good relations with China over its atrocious human rights record in places like Hong Kong and Xinjiang.\u201cThere must be no question of the UK authorities allowing the coronation to be used as a tool for international diplomacy for anyone involved in human rights abuses.\u201d"
