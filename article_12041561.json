        "Betty Richardson, 92, who lives at Care UK\u2019s Sway Place in Sway, Hampshire, has always had a love for theatre but this time wanted to see the men at Dreamboys go topless on stage.Thanks to an initiative by the team at Sway Place, where a \u201cWishing Tree\u201d was installed to allow residents to put forward ideas they want to explore, Ms Richardson\u2019s dream became a reality.Described as someone who appreciates the male physique and has always had a zest for life, Ms Richardson joined her friends at the Bournemouth Pavilion Theatre to enjoy a show by the Dreamboys \u2013 a striptease company that has been performing for more than 30 years.",
        "\u201cWell, I\u2019m not going to forget that in a hurry. Was that a dream or was I really there?\u201d she said.Ms Richardson was also treated to a meet and greet with the performers and was given a behind-the-scenes tour of the theatre.She was pictured with a beaming smile on her face while standing with the Dreamboys performers on stage.Jane Baxter, home manager at Sway Place, said Ms Richardson\u2019s dream is testament that \u201cage is just a number\u201d.\u201cOur Wishing Tree initiative is a great way for residents to share their goals and it\u2019s hugely rewarding to be able to make these a reality,\u201d she added.",
        "\u201cThe visit was a complete success, and it was lovely seeing her face light up watching the performance.\u201cI would like to thank the team at Dreamboys for making her visit extra special and to the team at Sway Place for organising it for her \u2013 it was fantastic to see Betty still chasing her dreams.\u201d",
        "Alice Woods, managing director for Dreamboys, said allowing Ms Richardson to meet the male striptease act \u201chad to happen\u201d after hearing about the 92-year-old\u2019s dream.\u201cWhen we heard that 92-year-old Betty had made a wish to see Dreamboys via her care home, we knew immediately that we had to make this happen,\u201d she said.\u201cWe specialise in celebrations and Betty wanting to visit our show was definitely one. We are a totally inclusive show that can entertain and celebrate any guests whether they are 18 or 101 (Yes, we had a lady celebrate her 101st birthday with us).\u201cWe ensured that Betty was given the full VIP experience at our Dreamboys show. Betty and her friends were treated to the best seats in the house and a private meet and greet with our fabulous team, we loved how this put a huge smile on Betty\u2019s face.\u201cWe love helping make dreams a reality no matter the occasion.\u201d"
