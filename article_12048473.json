        "The legend of Diego Maradona at Napoli hovers over the current team\u00b4s Italian league title, which was sealed Thursday.",
        "The Argentina standout holds saint-like status in Naples 2\u00bd years after his death and more than three decades after he led Napoli to its first two Serie A titles.Images of Maradona are still waved on huge banners inside the club\u00b4s stadium, which was renamed for him when he died in November 2020.In the downtown Quartieri Spagnoli, a huge mural of Maradona acts as an unofficial museum to the former player.\"It\u00b4s a problem in terms of overcrowding,\" Napoli Mayor Gaetan Manfredi said in a recent interview with The Associated Press. \"It\u00b4s a sort of secular cult, which is really appreciated.\"Added local taxi driver Antonio Tortora: \"Even after his death, he still brings people to Naples. He\u00b4s a saint.\"",
        "Maradona captained Napoli to the 1987 and 1990 Serie A titles, and also led the team to the 1989 UEFA Cup trophy. He gave hope to an entire generation of Neapolitans in the southern city, which is often seen as a poor cousin to the northern soccer capitals of Milan and Turin.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"
