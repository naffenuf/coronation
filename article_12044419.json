        "READ MORE: 'I avoid sex with my selfish husband'Q I am 61 and unhappily married for the second time. I was with my first husband for 28 years. We divorced six years ago but it was amicable and we had two children, who are now grown-up. Sadly, my ex-husband died three years later.\u00a0",
        "I was very lonely for a while following the divorce, and especially after his death, so when I met my second husband two years ago, I thought I had a chance to be happy again.\u00a0However, I have discovered that he constantly lies to me and I recently found out that he has been watching porn for hours on his phone as well as sending explicit texts to his ex.\u00a0 I know he's been watching porn and sexting his ex\u00a0 He was angry that I had looked at his phone but I know that he has looked at mine \u2012 even though I have nothing to hide. Conversations with him are difficult because he always thinks he\u2019s right and that only his opinion matters.\u00a0I am under pressure all the time to do what he wants. I feel tense and don\u2019t sleep well and it is affecting my health. I have no love for him any more. I need someone to tell me what to do. There is nothing left of the relationship but I\u2019d feel so guilty if I left him.",
        "A I am so sorry to hear this as you do sound desperately unhappy in your marriage. The death of your first husband must also have been very difficult for you. Even though you were divorced, he was the father of your children, and clearly there was still a friendship, so this is a huge loss.\u00a0",
        "I wonder if, because of your grief and loneliness, maybe you couldn\u2019t see your new husband\u2019s true colours. It\u2019s hard to make good decisions when our emotions are raw. You say that you need someone to tell you what to do but, actually, you already know that you want to end this marriage because there is nothing left \u2013 certainly no love.What you lack is the confidence to leave \u2013 perhaps because your husband is manipulative and controlling. He tries to make you feel guilty for looking at his phone (even though you had every reason to do so) and shifts the blame on to you when he is the one at fault.\u00a0 He's making you feel guilty when he is the one at fault\u00a0 And then there is the porn and his ex. Porn can be devastating for a relationship and has probably left you feeling unwanted, unloved and undesirable, although his habit is not a reflection on you, but about his own addiction. If there is any chance of your husband changing and getting help, he could look at pivotalrecovery.org.Unfortunately, the rest of his behaviour sounds selfish and he seems to care little about your feelings. It is never easy to leave a marriage \u2013 and perhaps harder in your 60s \u2013 so it is not a decision you should take lightly or unsupported. I recommend you seek counselling to help you make your mind up; visit relate.org.uk or bacp.co.uk.",
        "My friend didn't tell me my son was vaping\u00a0Q The son of one of my closest friends encouraged my son to start vaping a few months ago. I am furious with my friend because she knew but didn\u2019t tell me. Both boys are 16. Her eldest is not a bad lad but he\u2019s a bit rebellious and pushes the boundaries.\u00a0My son is shy and sometimes does things to fit in.\u00a0When I asked my friend why she hadn\u2019t told me, she replied that it was not her business what my son got up to and that there was nothing I could do about it \u2012 teenagers will \u2018go their own way\u2019. I am trying to help my son quit and to stand up for himself more. However, I wonder if I should continue my friendship?",
        "A I agree that your friend should have told you \u2013 it is disappointing that she didn\u2019t, especially as the boys are below the legal age for vaping. Perhaps her son pleaded with her not to tell you, or said that he would be angry with her if she did.Unfortunately, some teenagers will \u2018go their own way\u2019 whatever their parents do and it sounds as though your friend feels rather defeated in her attempts to keep her son on the right path. I can understand why she didn\u2019t want to fall out with him but this wasn\u2019t fair on you.\u00a0",
        "If she recognises that she made a mistake and should have trusted you with the information, then you might want to continue the friendship. However, if she remains totally unapologetic, you might not.\u00a0Your son could see his GP to find out about services that will help him quit vaping. He might want to rethink his friendship as well \u2012 a real friend wouldn\u2019t be encouraging him to do something that he really didn\u2019t want to.If you have a problem, write to Caroline West-Meads at YOU, 9 Derry Street, London W8 5HY, or email c.west-meads@mailonsunday.co.uk.
