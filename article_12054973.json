        "When the line-up for tonight\u2019s Coronation Concert was being assembled back in February, organisers were told Ed Sheeran would be too busy to be able to perform.",
        "Instead they booked stars including Katy Perry, who\u2019s taking a night off from her current job as a judge on TV talent show American Idol to sing at Windsor Castle. But guess who\u2019s filling in for her on the hit US show tonight? Ed Sheeran!The Shape Of You singer, fresh from winning his plagiarism court battle in New York last week, must have cleared some late space in his diary.Although the 32-year-old had a gig in Arlington, Texas, last night, a private jet could have got him to Windsor in time, just about, but he has instead decided to stay in America.",
        "California Gurls singer Katy, 38, has been offered an overnight stay at Windsor Castle for her troubles, and she was full of praise for her stand-in, calling Sheeran \u2018the best producer, artist and life-liver\u2019.She\u2019s not the only American Idol star taking time off to perform for the King tonight, as fellow judge Lionel Richie is also on the bill.He will be replaced on the show by singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette."
