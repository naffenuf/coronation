She'd previously stated she'd experienced\u00a0Breast Implant Illness (BII), which can cause a range of health issues.'Feeling stronger every day,' she wrote on her Story.'I didn't even touch a weight for a whole year after my explant. I took my healing very slowly.'",
        "She went on to thank popular fitness program Fitazfk and said she loves feeling 'strong again'.In a separate post, Davina shared another before and after photo, which featured a photo of herself just after filming I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! last year.'Sometimes we are blind to progress when we are looking too closely,' she continued.'So much inflammation, so much stress, I didn't feel like I was living authentically.'",
        "She added: 'When I look at her I can feel her sadness, the pressure she put on herself to make her life look \"perfect.\" I actually have a tear in my eye looking back at her now. Crazy how much can change in a year.'\u00a0",
        "On Tuesday, Davina confirmed she'd\u00a0split from Jaxon less than a year after tying the knot.She issued a statement on Tuesday confirming the break-up 'speculation' after fans noticed she had\u00a0quietly unfollowed\u00a0Jaxon\u00a0on Instagram.The former couple, who are parents to three-year-old daughter Mila-Mae,\u00a0had been married for less than a year.",

        "The pair tied the knot in a glamorous wedding in April last year.But\u00a0suspicions were\u00a0raised\u00a0when Jaxon abruptly\u00a0stopped\u00a0appearing on his wife's Instagram grid in\u00a0August 2022.\u00a0Four months later, in\u00a0December,\u00a0Davina hinted at heartbreak when she shared a cryptic post about\u00a02022 being her year of self-discovery.'2022 has been the biggest year of spiritual and mental growth for me and for the first time in my life I can finally hear the whispers of my heart,' she wrote.",
        "'I'm in touch with my institution and I've stopped people pleasing and I'm tackling my fear of judgement head on.'This year I grew into something I could have never imagined\u2026 MYSELF.'Nevertheless, Davina insisted as recently as January they were still together, telling So Dramatic: 'We are definitely still married.\u00a0Although I should probably post more photos of him.'Davina rose to fame as one of the original MAFS villains during the breakout 2018 season. She was notorious for cheating on her 'husband' Ryan Gallagher with right-wing YouTuber Dean Wells, but later blamed her actions on a bad edit."
