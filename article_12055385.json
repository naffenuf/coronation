        "New York were dismantled by a complete Miami team during Game 3 Saturday\u00a0To make matters worse, the uninspired Knicks lost Quickley to an injury in Q4\u00a0DailyMail.com provides all the latest international sports news\u00a0Immanuel Quickley suffered a sprained left ankle according to Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau to make matters worse after its 105-86 loss to Miami Saturday.",
        "The energetic third-year guard was having a positive impact off the bench for the outclassed Knicks\u00a0before his ankle got caught underneath a sprawling Bam Adebayo while fighting for a loose ball halfway through the fourth.'Sprained ankle. So, we'll know more tomorrow,' Thibodeau said postgame while speaking at his press conference.Quickley writhed in pain on the hardwood before Thibodeau came out to check on the bench player, in what was yet another blow to an already dismal afternoon in South Beach.\u00a0Naturally, there is little information on hand as to the severity of the ex-Kentucky star's injury and how long he will miss, if at all.",
        "Quickley was a rare embodiment of efficiency on a dour day for New York in the 305, in which the visitors never led.The 23-year-old scored 12 points off the bench (4-of-12 FG) including two three-pointers.\u00a0Quickley's three-pointers were even more valuable considered the Knicks' terrible 20% accuracy (8-of-40) from three point land.\u00a0New York has an opportunity to tie the series up at 2-2 Monday before heading back to Madison Square Garden for a defining Game 6 on Wednesday.\u00a0Jalen Brunson led all Knicks scorers with 20 points in a largely inadequate Knicks performance.\u00a0"
