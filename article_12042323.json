        "MPs have raised concerns about the recent \u201cexplosion\u201d of artificial intelligence (AI) and called for the UK to lead the world in developing global standards for the new field.",
        "Tory former minister Tim Loughton argued that AI potentially poses the same level of \u201cmoral dilemma\u201d as advances in medical technology, whilst Labour\u2019s Darren Jones said people are \u201crightly worried\u201d about how it could affect the political process.Mr Jones, who chairs the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee, asked ministers what steps they are currently taking to \u201cprotect\u201d the integrity of elections in light of artificial intelligence used to create convincing images, audio and video hoaxes.",
        "Tory former cabinet minister Greg Clark, chairman of the Science and Technology Committee, spoke about the need for the UK to \u201cseize the initiative and set out an international approach to the standards in AI\u201d.Science Secretary Chloe Smith, who is replacing Michelle Donelan whilst on maternity leave, said the Government is promoting \u201cour vision for a global ecosystem that balances innovation and the use of AI\u201d.Their comments came during Science and Technology questions in the Commons.AI has been on the rise in recent years, with ChatGPT, a form of generative AI, coming to prominence in recent months after a version was released to the public last year. Our approach will be proportionate, pro-innovative and adaptable  Science Secretary Chloe Smith  Technology experts, including Elon Musk, have urged scientists to pause developing AI to ensure it does not pose a risk to humanity.",
        "Mr Loughton told MPs: \u201cWhen advances in medical technology around genetic engineering, for example, raise sensitive issues, we have debates on medical ethics, we adapt legislation and put in place robust regulation and oversight.\u201cThe explosion in AI potentially poses the same level of moral dilemma and it is open to criminal use, for fraud, impersonation and by malign players such as the Chinese government for example.\u201cAs leaders in AI, what should the UK be doing to balance safety with opportunity and innovation?\u201dMs Smith said the Government recognises \u201cmany technologies can pose a risk when in the wrong hands\u201d, adding: \u201cThe UK is a global leader in AI, with the strategic advantage that places us at the forefront of these developments.\u201cNow, through UK leadership, including at the OECD and the G7, the Council of Europe and more, we are promoting our vision for a global ecosystem that balances innovation and the use of AI underpinned by our shared values, of course, of freedom, fairness, and democracy.\u201cOur approach will be proportionate, pro-innovative and adaptable.\u201dOn the risk posed by AI to the UK\u2019s democratic processes, Mr Jones later asked: \u201cWith elections under way and a general election due next year, people are rightly concerned about the fake videos, images, and audio being created by artificial intelligence.",
        "\u201cCan the Secretary of State confirm to the House what actions her department is taking to protect the integrity of our democratic processes in that context?\u201d",
        "Ms Smith said the UK already has a \u201cfully developed regime of electoral law\u201d that \u201calready accounts for election offences such as false statements by candidates\u201d, adding: \u201cBut we are setting out in addition to that existing regulation, an approach on AI that will look to regulators in different sectors to be able to apply the correct guidance whilst we also add a central co-ordinating function that will be able to seek out risks and deal with them flexibly, appropriately and proportionately.\u201dOn ensuring the UK can benefit from AI, Mr Clark said: \u201cAt its best, Britain has been highly influential in setting international standards, combining confidence with security.\u201cDoes she agree with the chair of the business select committee (Darren Jones) and myself that the UK should now seize the initiative and set out an international approach to the standards in AI so that we can gain all of the benefits that come from AI but make sure we don\u2019t suffer the harms\u2026?Ms Smith responded: \u201cI think the short answer there is yes.\u201d"
