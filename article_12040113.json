        "His life was touched by tragedy at just two years old when his father died.",
        "But that hasn't stopped\u00a0Robert Irwin, the son of late\u00a0conservationist Steve 'The Crocodile Hunter' Irwin, from having a morbid sense of humour.The 19-year-old zookeeper revealed this week he has a rather grim hobby: posing for photos with gravestones and memorials bearing his own name.He posted a gallery of Instagram snaps from his travels in which he is seen alongside tributes to other\u00a0Roberts from around the world.Some of the photos show him with street signs or outside airports, but others show him next to tombstones for men who shared the same name.",
        "In one picture,\u00a0Robert stands in front of a statue of a famous Robert.In another, he smiles and points to the sign for Roberts Field, Redmond Municipal Airport in Oregon, where his mother Terri is from.One picture is of his\u00a0name engraved in\u00a0concrete - possibly a memorial to someone deceased. Others show a 'Roberts Road' and a\u00a0tombstone for\u00a0Robert William Irwin.'Roberts of the world\u2026 a thread,' the wildlife photographer captioned the post.",
        "It comes after Robert thrilled fans recently by recreating an iconic picture featuring him and his late father Steve.He shared a throwback photo on Instagram of himself as a toddler sitting on Steve's lap and holding the wheel of his father's utility truck.Robert then posted a recent image of himself driving the same ute, which he coincidentally learned to drive in.",
        "Steve Irwin died on September 4, 2006, at the age of 44 after he was pierced in the chest by a stingray barb while filming a wildlife documentary in Queensland.His son was just two years old at the time, and his daughter Bindi was eight."
