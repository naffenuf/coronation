        "The King and Queen have appeared on American Idol as surprise guests amid the coronation celebrations.",
        "American Idol judges Lionel Richie and Katy Perry appeared on a livestream from Windsor Castle to speak to the singing contest\u2019s host Ryan Seacrest following their performance at the Coronation Concert.All Night Long singer Richie, 73, said: \u201cWhat a party, it was unbelievable.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to figure out what can we do to bring something different to the show, so I have a surprise.\u201dPerry, wearing a green off-the-shoulder silk dress with matching pearl earrings and necklace, appeared shocked when Charles and Camilla strolled into the royal room.Charles, wearing a navy suit and a light blue tie, joked: \u201cI just wanted to check how long you\u2019ll be using this room for.\u201dHe later said: \u201cThank you so much for your brilliant performance, it\u2019s a pleasure to have you both here. It\u2019s a great treat to have you both here.\u201dCamilla, wearing an electric blue jacket, said of their performance: \u201cFantastic, absolutely fantastic.\u201dPerry, 38, asked Camilla if they were making \u201ctoo much noise\u201d and the pair joked quietly together.",
        "Meanwhile Richie said: \u201cWe understand there\u2019s a party\u2026 you\u2019re throwing the party right next door.\u201dCharles replied: \u201cAh you\u2019ve heard about that\u2026 we better take you to that, but you are busy with all these other things.\u201d\u201cAs soon as we finish, we\u2019re coming to the party,\u201d Richie said.",
        "As Charles and Camilla walked off, Richie added: \u201cWe love you guys, and congratulations.\u201dIt is understood the appearance was not planned and was a genuinely spontaneous moment decided by Charles and Camilla during the evening, and a sign of the long-standing and warm relationship between the King and Queen and Richie and Perry.Richie has been involved with the Prince\u2019s Trust since the 1980s and Perry is an ambassador for The British Asian Trust, a charity founded by the King when he was Prince of Wales.The episode of American Idol also saw British singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran perform the live TV debut of his song Eyes Closed from his latest album \u2013 (Subtract).During Sunday night\u2019s Coronation Concert, held in the grounds of Windsor Castle, Perry performed her hits Roar and Firework, with Richie treating the royals and guests to his songs Easy and All Night Long (All Night)."
