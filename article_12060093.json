        "Mark Hughes expressed his delight after Bradford booked their place in the League Two play-offs by fighting back to draw with champions Leyton Orient.",
        "The Bantams got the point they needed to make sure of a top-seven finish with a 1-1 draw against Orient in front of a 22,576 crowd \u2013 the biggest for a league game at Valley Parade this century.Right-back Brad Halliday scored his first goal since December 2020 to cancel out Jordan Brown\u2019s opener for the visitors.Bradford will now face Carlisle in the play-off semi-finals.Hughes said: \u201cWe\u2019re obviously pleased because it was a difficult fixture for us. We were up against the champions and everybody saw they are champions for a reason.\u201cThey are an outstanding team at this level so going up against them in a game we still needed to get something out of looked a difficult task prior to kick-off.",
        "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t one that was beyond us but we obviously had to do the right things.\u201cWe had the setback of the initial goal going against us but came back really quickly, which was important.\u201cI felt then it was a game between two evenly-matched teams who didn\u2019t give any quarter to each other.\u201cWe\u2019re in a play-off situation. We still have an opportunity to get out of this league and that was the goal before the season started.\u201dBradford went close after four minutes as Andy Cook\u2019s looping header was tipped on the bar by Lawrence Vigouroux.",
        "Then Romoney Crichlow stabbed wide from Sam Stubbs\u2019 flick-on before Jamie Walker fired into the side-netting and Vigouroux again saved well from Cook.But it was Orient who struck first after 41 minutes, Bradford failing to deal with a corner before Brown swept home from 10 yards.The home side\u2019s response was rapid to equalise two minutes later as Halliday\u2019s volley took a heavy deflection beyond Vigouroux.Orient manager Richie Wellens said: \u201cThe last week has been really difficult keeping myself, the staff and the players motivated.\u201cBut I thought we came here and put in a good performance and kept Bradford honest. If they didn\u2019t score so quickly after us, I think we could have dominated the game and possession.\u201cCredit to them because they have responded well.\u201cThe last 15 minutes was played out because the result was OK for both. But you have to respect the competition we\u2019re in and we did that.\u201cBradford have earned their play-off position. Hughesy was a hero of mine as a Man United fan and I wish him well. They are a big club.\u201cAs for us, we\u2019ve enjoyed today and we\u2019re going to enjoy our break in Marbella even more.\u201cAfter that we need to come back and re-engage and plan for our future.\u201d"
