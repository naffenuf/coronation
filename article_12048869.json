        "The war in Ukraine is a \u201cwarning shot\u201d for the possibility of a future with energy shortages, the new chair of the Commons Energy Security and Net Zero Committee has said.",
        "SNP MP Angus MacNeil has been elected as chairman of the cross-party committee of MPs tasked with scrutinising the work of the new Government department of the same name.Speaking to the PA news agency, Mr MacNeil was critical of what he described as a lack of investment in energy security during the austerity agenda, followed by a lack of focus during the years of Brexit wrangling, and highlighted the importance of renewable energy for future supplies. I think the word security is very important going forward, the security of supply, and a focus on that, and I\u2019m glad to see it\u2019s heading in that direction  SNP MP Angus MacNeil  He said: \u201cI think there\u2019s been a penny-wise pound-foolish pressure on the UK energy market for a number of years. I\u2019m talking what bill payers might have had to pay seven to 10 years ago would have been very modest compared to what they have had to pay lately.\u201cAnd I think some things could have been in place that weren\u2019t in place. And I think people have learned from that, and I think the word security is very important going forward, the security of supply, and a focus on that, and I\u2019m glad to see it\u2019s heading in that direction.\u201d",
        "He added: \u201cI think it was short-term political expediency from the Cameron and May years, with George Osborne as ever being very, very pound-foolish \u2026 on energy security.",
        "\u201cInvesting a little bit today to reap huge benefits tomorrow \u2013 I think if George Osborne had been a farmer he would never have bought any plant seed because it was unnecessary expenditure, oblivious to the harvest that would be coming from that.\u201d Perhaps the Ukraine war tells us another thing about energy. This energy crisis has not been because forms of energy have run out  SNP MP Angus MacNeil  Asked if scrutiny in terms of drawing the public\u2019s attention to the importance of energy security had been sufficient in recent years, he said: \u201cQuite obviously not. Hopefully it will in the future.\u201dMr MacNeil is familiar with energy and climate policy, having served for a time as chairman of the Energy and Climate Change Committee, which was originally set up in 2009 and dissolved when that department merged with business and industrial strategy in 2016 under former prime minister Theresa May.He said there had since been \u201ca rude awakening\u201d on the importance of energy security.He told PA: \u201cPerhaps the Ukraine war tells us another thing about energy. This energy crisis has not been because forms of energy have run out.\u201d",
        "He went on: \u201cIt may come to it at another point in the future where it\u2019s not any sort of man-made constraint or conflict-made constraint, but it\u2019s natural constraint \u2013 the stuff isn\u2019t there. What I\u2019m saying is that there has been a constraint on energy that has been created by the war, there may be a constraint in the future that\u2019s created just by the availability of our energy  SNP MP Angus MacNeil  \u201cAnd so the more sustainable you look to make your energy supply, and the more renewable, the less of a problem you might have in the future.\u201cSo you might be able to look at this moment in history as being a sort of warning shot as to what might happen in the future when there are genuine difficulties around energy.\u201cI\u2019m not saying that war isn\u2019t a genuine difficulty, but what I\u2019m saying is that\u00a0there has been a constraint on energy that has been created by the war, there may be a constraint in the future that\u2019s created just by the availability of our energy.\u201dOne possible place to start looking for more alternatives to fossil fuels could be his own constituency of Na h-Eileanan an Iar, Gaelic for the Western Isles, which he describes as \u201cprobably the Saudi Arabia of wind energy and renewable energy\u201d.",
        "Addressing the Government\u2019s 2050 net-zero target, he said he did not want to be \u201cpresumptuous\u201d on the adequacy or likelihood of reaching it, but said: \u201cWe haven\u2019t had a department for energy for about seven years. That\u2019s only four seven-year periods to 2050. It\u2019s not a long time.\u201d"
