        "MADRID, May 8 (Reuters) - Spanish stock market regulator CNMV on Monday suspended the trading of shares in NH Hotel Group SA pending information from the company, which had posted its first-quarter results a few hours earlier.",
        "The regulator said it was a \"precautionary measure\" taken \"while relevant information on the aforementioned entity is disseminated\".Earlier on Monday, NH, which is a unit of Thai company Minor International, said its first-quarter net recurring loss had halved to 40 million euros ($44.2 million) from a year ago as it expected demand to remain strong in coming months.The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Its shares had risen about 1% on the day before the suspension. ($1 = 0.9056 euros) (Reporting by David Latona and Corina Pons; Editing by Andrei Khalip)"
