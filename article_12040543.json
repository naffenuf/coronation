It means that my hard work over the past 15 years has paid off. I spent most of my time mentoring my 97% female team and winning a leadership award of this magnitude means so much to me as a leader &amp; CEO. I started this company in 2008 with the mission of empowering women to live their boldest life and am happy to say I wake up everyday with the same passion and mission I had 15 years ago.'What does it take to be a great founder?'A great founder wakes up everyday with the word yes, not no. A great founder really wants to work with their employees to create a positive work culture because they recognize they really can\u2019t do it all by themselves. I also always give people the recognition they deserve and give my employees guidance on where they are going with their careers.'",

Ever since then, I knew that this was the industry I wanted to be in.'What is your leadership style?'I would say I have a participative leadership style. I don\u2019t micromanage people and want my employees to be their own problem solvers so they can grow within the company. Most of my employees have been with me for a very long time and I love seeing them evolve &amp; become leaders! I spend most of my time workshopping with my teams and they are always eager to bounce their ideas off me.'Alicia uses her platform to give back through her philanthropy initiative, Grande Gives Back, raising over $800,000 for those in need.Head to the Grande Cosmetics website now to check out the range of beauty products loved by millions of women across the States.\u00a0"
