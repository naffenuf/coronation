It's been a great privilege to work closely with scores of truly incredible performers and we'd also like to take the opportunity to thank the BBC and all our many fans around the world for their support over the years.'The series was created by Dan Patterson and Mark Leveson, the duo behind comedy improvisation show Whose Line Is It Anyway?, which ran in the UK before becoming a hit series in the United States."
