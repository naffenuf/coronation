        "MILAN, May 5 (Reuters) - Italy's biggest bank Intesa Sanpaolo on Friday raised its 2023 profit goal after nearly doubling its first quarter net income from a year earlier, thanks to higher interest rates and shrinking loan loss provisions.",
        "Intesa forecast a net income of 7 billion euros ($7.7 billion) this year, after saying in February it would top last year's result of 5.5 billion.The upgrade comes after fellow heavyweight UniCredit on Wednesday raised its 2023 profit target by more than a fifth.Net income in the first quarter came in at 1.96 billion euros, well above an analyst consensus gathered by Reuters of 1.54 billion euros.
