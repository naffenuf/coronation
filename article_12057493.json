The speech was followed by the national anthem, which was sung by all present, including Prince George. The King smiled and waved to the crowd at the end of the national anthem.",
        "Just before Hugh Bonneville introduced the final act, Take That, the BBC cut to the royal box, where Kermit the Frog waved a Union flag in front of a grinning Duke of Edinburgh.The King looked to his left as he clapped before Bonneville signed off: 'And, of course, thank you your majesties, for allowing us to perform for you here. We sincerely hope you and the frog have enjoyed yourselves.'",
        "The camera then showed a wide view of the royal box, with Charles and Camilla smiling while Kermit nodded.There was no sign of Miss Piggy."
