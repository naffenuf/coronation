        "A politician\u2019s \u201cOlympic\u201d effort carrying a sword and a yawning Prince Louis were among the lighter highlights for social media users watching the King\u2019s coronation across the world.",
        "The coronation at Westminster Abbey was the top trend worldwide on Twitter on Saturday, with more than half a million tweets posted with the hashtag #Coronation by 1pm.Among the more unorthodox highlights, many social media users commended Lord President of the Council Penny Mordaunt after she became the first woman to carry the Sword of State into the abbey.The honour required her to carry the large golden weapon as she walked through Westminster Abbey, before being presented with a second, smaller sword \u2013 the Jewelled Sword of Offering \u2013 which she presented to the King as part of the service, becoming the first woman to do so.\u201cWhat a shift from Penny Mordaunt,\u201d tweeted television presenter Dan Walker.\u201cFinally she gets to put the sword down. Get her in the Olympics.\u201d",
        "Fellow Twitter user @garius posted: \u201cPenny Mordaunt has now been holding that sword longer than Liz Truss was Prime Minister.\u201dAmong many to make the same joke, Labour MP Chris Bryant tweeted: \u201cThe Penny is mightier than the sword.\u201dPrince Louis, who captivated viewers with his behaviour at the Platinum Jubilee last year, was also closely watched by many.Images taken in Westminster Abbey showed the five-year-old yawning and staring at the ceiling, and later television footage showed he had disappeared from alongside his parents the Prince and Princess of Wales and sister Princess Charlotte.",
        "\u201cAssume Prince Louis reached tipping point\u2026 He vanished a while ago,\u201d tweeted Twitter user @Fyrishsunset.\u201cEither that or he\u2019s crawling around tying shoelaces together.\u201dHe reappeared alongside his family a short while later.\u201cTo be fair Prince Louis behaved a lot better than the last time a Prince Louis occupied London during the crowning of a king,\u201d historian Dan Snow tweeted, referencing the actions of the future Louis VIII of France at the beginning of Henry III\u2019s reign in the 13th century.\u201cHe didn\u2019t fill the breach at Dover Castle with corpses for a start.\u201dCelebrities were also a hot topic, with the appearance of Australian musician Nick Cave, of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, inspiring jokes after he took a seat at the back of Westminster Abbey.\u201cNick Cave and the Back Seats,\u201d posted user @GoldenVision90.Other viewers felt the ceremony was longer than necessary, with columnist Ian Dunt tweeting: \u201cThey could\u2019ve shaved 30 minutes off this bad boy.\u201cEverything after the crown bit is a bit Hobbits-on-the-bed.\u201dTV critic Scott Bryan went further, posting: \u201cThis could have been an email.\u201dMany watching the ceremony were reminded of the finale of Rowan Atkinson\u2019s 2003 spy comedy Johnny English, in which the protagonist snatches the crown during the coronation of antagonist Pascal Sauvage, played by John Malkovich.",
        "User @Ben_Hinch10 tweeted: \u201cAnyone else watching the #Coronation to see if Johnny English pops up and accidentally becomes king?\u201dWhile other broadcasters were showing the coronation ceremony, Channel 4 broadcast the 2018 comedy sequel Johnny English Strikes Again."
