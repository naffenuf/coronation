I had no idea how I would become an actress, but I knew it was what I wanted to do; it was what made me feel happiest, it was what made me feel most free, least judged somehow.'I had so much self-doubt growing up - oh my goodness, I still do. I have made peace with the fact that it is there.",
        "'It's the practice of letting it be in the passenger seat. You have to say: \"You are not going to drive but you can be here\".'Vanessa looked sensational as she modelled a series of striking looks in a photoshoot for the magazine.In one image, she stood out in a bold, azure blue gown which featured a ruching design and perfectly clung to her curves.While another image sees her opting for a more simplistic black vest, with her make-up adding a touch of drama with dark red lips and lashings of mascara.",

        "Kirby said her co-star Tom Cruise is 'the most passionate actor'.He knows more about cinema, cares more about it, than anyone I have ever met,' she said.'He also believes anything is possible, and that really inspires everyone around him to believe in what their own mission is.'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One will be released by Paramount Pictures on July 12 in the US and two days later in the UK.It comes as Vanessa\u00a0was the epitome of chic as she arrived at the 2023 Met Gala at New York's\u00a0Metropolitan Museum of Art on Monday.",
