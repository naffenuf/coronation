        "Neil Warnock hailed Huddersfield\u2019s \u201cunbelievable\u201d final points tally of 53 after overseeing a 2-0 Sky Bet Championship win over relegated Reading in his last match before returning to retirement.",
        "The Terriers\u2019 great escape from the drop was confirmed courtesy of last week\u2019s victory over Sheffield United, with Monday\u2019s triumph \u2013 the seventh under Warnock\u2019s temporary charge \u2013 the cherry on the top for the 74-year-old.Prospective American owner Kevin M Nagle was in attendance at the John Smith\u2019s Stadium for the match, with the points secured by stunning second-half goals from Josh Koroma and substitute Joseph Hungbo.Koroma broke the deadlock after 49 minutes before Watford loanee Hungbo came off the bench to seal matters six minutes from time.\u201cI was pleased I could leave him (Nagle) a Championship club,\u201d said Warnock, whose side ended the campaign in 18th spot, nine points clear of the relegation zone.\u201cI wanted to finish on a win and to get 53 points is unbelievable.",
        "\u201cThese times you have to treasure. I told the players that because they don\u2019t come along very often.\u201cYou would have thought we had got promotion to the Premier League, with the crowd. You can\u2019t tell me it would have been any more vociferous.\u201cBut the fans know what a job it has been to turn it round. To see everyone stay behind at the end, I can\u2019t put it into words.\u201dAsked what he might be doing when the Championship kicks off again next season, the south-west-based veteran suggested he might be watching League One champions Plymouth.",
        "\u201cIt is great because me and my daughter go to all the home matches,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Plymouth play Huddersfield first match, I might be watching Huddersfield again.\u201cI can sit down, have a nice meal, a nice glass of wine, no pressure, no worry about substitutions, get driven home\u2026 it\u2019s perfect\u2026 until February.\u201dHuddersfield fans pleaded for one more year from Warnock, but he said: \u201cYou can\u2019t do this for 10 months.\u201cI hate the motorways, I hate the hotels, I don\u2019t need that at my age. But I don\u2019t mind for 10-12 weeks!\u201dNoel Hunt, who could not mastermind a win during his tenure as interim Reading boss, admitted his own future remains unsure but reckons the future is bright for the Royals despite relegation.\u201cI have not even thought about it,\u201d the Irishman responded when asked if he would like the role permanently.\u201cAs far as I was told, this was until the end of the season and then who knows?\u201cI was pretty sure I was probably going back to the under-23s. But I have not had that conversation. So your guess is as good as mine.\u201dOn Reading\u2019s fall into the game\u2019s third tier, Hunt said: \u201cI have seen teams go down to League One and two years later be in the Premier League. Norwich and Southampton did it.",
        "\u201cMaybe a reset is going to be good and what the club needs. But we have a lot of good players signed here and a lot of good young boys coming through.\u201cSo the future is bright, no matter what.\u201d"
