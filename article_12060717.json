        "Rodri insists that Manchester City are out for revenge against Real Madrid\u00a0However, Pep Guardiola says it's an opportunity, not a chance for revenge\u00a0OLIVER HOLT: Erling Haaland, your hunger makes you my Footballer of the Year\u00a0\u00a0Manchester City's stars are going to the Bernabeu seeking revenge for last season\u2019s dramatic Champions League exit at the hands of Real Madrid.",
        "Rodri insisted that the Premier League champions have learned lessons from the capitulation in last year\u2019s semi-final, when they blew a two-goal lead in stoppage time of the second leg.The midfielder has never watched that game back but, with Real the obstacle to another final, claimed City are in the Spanish capital to settle scores on Tuesday.\u2018Football gives you the option for revenge,\u2019 Rodri said. \u2018We\u2019re in a great moment, afraid of nothing. We trust 100 per cent that we\u2019re going to be able to qualify.\u2018We have motivation with the feeling that we are doing things very good this year and we arrive in our best moment.",
        "\u2018Last year we did 180 brilliant minutes but sometimes it isn\u2019t enough, you can lose in five minutes. We didn\u2019t handle it in the right way and we have learned from that. The environment has changed a lot.\u2018Tomorrow we will try to give nothing to them and kill them when we can. Score goals in the moment you can punish.\u2018We need to fight like a small team, and then we have top quality players. We will fight hard again. We\u2019ve been brilliant. The Treble? Not many teams can say this.\u2019Rodri\u2019s manager, Pep Guardiola, however chose to warn his players against becoming side-tracked by the potential for revenge, worrying it could make the tie too emotional.",
        "\u2018It would be a huge mistake,\u2019 Guardiola said. \u2018We\u2019re not here for revenge, just an opportunity. We can learn a little bit from what happened. You cannot become crazy. It's a football game.\u2018I reviewed the games over the last two days and we couldn\u2019t have played better in the home leg. Last season was the end of the world and we\u2019re back. One day we will reach the final again and one day we will win it.\u2019Bernardo Silva has also referenced the potential for revenge in recent weeks, while Guardiola revealed that he feels pressure to deliver the only trophy missing from City\u2019s cabinet.",
        "\u2018The demand to win the Champions League, I know it,\u2019 the Catalan added. \u2018I had the feeling when I arrived. They [the club] never asked me but I had the feeling after the first Premier League [title] that the target would be to win a trophy that you don\u2019t have.\u2019Despite perennially crowned as kings of Europe, Real were downplaying their prospects of progressing past City in consecutive seasons on Monday night. Carlo Ancelotti fears that paying too much attention to 51-goal Erling Haaland could prove fateful.\u2018Obviously he is a very dangerous player, he is showing impressive quality especially in scoring goals, but only talking about him means not talking about a very complete team,\u2019 Ancelotti said.",
        "\u2018They defend well, attacks, has ideas, so we are not thinking about a game to stop him but to stop a team that seems unstoppable. But I think we can have a chance to do a good, equal, competitive game that we can win.\u2019"
