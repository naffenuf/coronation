        "Interim manager Jimmy McNulty is hoping to take charge of relegated Rochdale on a permanent basis next season.",
        "Dale ended 102 years as an EFL club with a 1-1 draw at Harrogate, with Jimmy Keohane\u2019s first-half goal cancelled out by a Toby Sims effort after the break.But the Lancashire outfit have at least been relegated with a semblance of pride under McNulty, who oversaw three wins and three draws during the final eight fixtures of the campaign.On his hopes of staying at the Spotland helm in the National League next term, McNulty said: \u201cThe club want to go through a thorough recruitment process and I think that\u2019s good. It\u2019s what should be done.\u201cIt\u2019s partly my doing too because, every time the club have wanted to speak to me about the situation, I\u2019ve just wanted to concentrate on the players and the next game. But I know the club want a head coach and, for certain, I want the job.\u201cWe\u2019ve got six results from the last eight games, which no-one would have said we could have done, so I\u2019m happy with how it\u2019s gone and when it\u2019s my turn, I\u2019ll be speaking to the club in the next few days about how we move forward.\u201d",
        "Delivering his verdict on the game, McNulty added: \u201cIt was a good away point and I\u2019d like to know how many passes led to our goal, because I really enjoyed watching it.",
        "\u201cWe just looked a bit tired in the second half and it showed how short we are as a squad because we had no real options to help out.\u201dHarrogate finished nine points clear of the bottom two, having lost just one of their final 10 fixtures after flirting with relegation for long periods of the campaign.Boss Simon Weaver said: \u201cI\u2019m hoping the form we\u2019ve been on can launch us into next season because we had gone through some hardship and the eye of a storm.\u201cLessons will need to be learned but this group of players have shown now that they can hold their nerve under pressure. Our supporters have also stayed loyal and they realise the journey that we\u2019ve been on.\u201cIt\u2019s been difficult at times because we\u2019ve had a series of bad runs but that\u2019s when you find out the most about your friends and fans and they have stood by us.\u201dHe also praised right-back Sims, who scored his first goal in the English pro game having made the unlikely switch from US second-tier outfit Pittsburgh Riverhounds in January.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to think that a move won\u2019t work because he\u2019s 25 and hasn\u2019t played at this level before,\u201d Weaver acknowledged.\u201cBut I think we\u2019ve got a gem in Toby and there\u2019s no player I would have wanted more to score our final goal of the season.\u201d"
