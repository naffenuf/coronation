        "A pub has closed a month after its collection of golliwogs was seized by police, amid a boycott by suppliers.",
        "Five officers removed a collection of the dolls \u2013 based on 18th century minstrels and now regarded as racist caricatures \u2013 from the White Hart Inn in Grays, Essex, on April 4 after a hate crime allegation.The pub\u2019s leaseholders, Benice Ryley and her husband Chris, reportedly closed the pub to customers from Monday night amid the fallout from the well-publicised dolls row. I feel gutted, totally and utterly gutted  Benice Ryley  In an interview with Thurrock Nub News, Mrs Ryley said \u201cI\u2019ve had enough\u201d, claiming Carlsberg and Heineken had told the pub to stop selling their lager and that maintenance firm Innserve refused to work at the pub.She also criticised the Campaign For Real Ale (Camra) for entering the dispute after it removed the pub from the Good Beer Guide and banned it from receiving its awards.Mrs Ryley had displayed the collection of about 30 dolls, donated by her late aunt and customers, in the pub for nearly 10 years.The pub was graffitied and had five windows damaged on April 16 after the seizure of the dolls.",
        "Mrs Ryley told Thurrock Nub News: \u201cI feel gutted, totally and utterly gutted. Hurt, upset. I\u2019ve had very, very much support from many people about the gollies.\u201cWe\u2019ve had a few bits of hate, which I personally don\u2019t understand because it\u2019s part of our life.\u201d",
        "She insisted \u201cyoung people these days don\u2019t understand\u201d the history of the dolls, saying some of her \u201ccollection\u201d are \u201cantiques\u201d.She added: \u201cI want them back. Basically, this is my life now, that they\u2019ve ruined because we\u2019ve got a stigma with our name now and with the pub.\u201cI\u2019m going to miss the pub, I\u2019m going to miss the people. We have had so many laughs in here. We have had so much happiness in here.\u201dShe said she \u201cprobably would have plodded on with the pub\u201d if the police had not become involved, but claimed \u201cthey\u2019ve ruined our name\u201d. We believe pubs are for everyone - there is never a place for discrimination  Nik Antona  An Essex Police spokesperson said: \u201cAt this stage our investigation is still ongoing.\u201dThe force last month denied being directly reprimanded by Home Secretary Suella Braverman after the dolls were removed.At the time, a source close to the Home Secretary said her unhappiness at the incident had been passed on to the force, as first reported by the Mail Online.The outlet quoted a Home Office source as saying police forces \u201cshould not be getting involved in this kind of nonsense\u201d and should focus on \u201ccatching criminals\u201d.Mrs Ryley previously previously told the PA news agency: \u201cThey\u2019re my childhood history, it\u2019s a part of our inheritance. I can\u2019t see any harm.",
        "\u201cI really am angry because what they\u2019ve taken away is valuable.\u201cI don\u2019t know how they can find it offensive. If they don\u2019t like it, they don\u2019t have to come through the door.\u201d After being made aware of the abhorrent display feature in the White Hart Inn, we advised the pub owners that we want nothing more to do with them  Heineken UK  Camra national chairman Nik Antona said: \u201cFollowing the announcement that the White Hart in Grays, Essex, has closed, Camra now hopes this heritage venue is preserved as a pub and will provide a warm welcome to all.\u201cWe believe pubs are for everyone \u2013 there is never a place for discrimination.\u201dA Heineken UK spokesperson said: \u201cAfter being made aware of the abhorrent display feature in the White Hart Inn, we advised the pub owners that we want nothing more to do with them.\u201cThey go against everything we stand for. We believe pubs should be places of inclusivity and respect for all people, regardless of their race, ethnicity, religion or gender.\u201cWe have made it clear that we want all Heineken UK brands removed, and there will be no further contact with the pub from Heineken UK.\u201dA spokesperson for Admiral Taverns, which owns the pub building, said: \u201cThe licensees have made us aware of their decision to leave the pub.",
        "\u201cWe will be looking to reopen the pub under the management of new licensees in due course.\u201dA Carlsberg Marston\u2019s Brewing Company spokesperson said: \u201cWe believe pubs should be an enjoyable place for everyone and we will take steps to seek removal of our beers from venues who do not share our values.\u201cWhilst we do not directly supply the pub in question, after being made aware of the police investigation we contacted our third-party distributor to make our views clear.\u201d"
