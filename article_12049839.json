        "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has said he will declare his allegiance to the King at the coronation \u2013 despite believing that Australia should have its own head of state.",
        "Mr Albanese voted in a failed referendum in 1999 for an Australian citizen to replace the British monarch as the country\u2019s head of state.He said he accepted that a majority of Australians chose for the country to remain a constitutional monarchy instead of becoming a republic and would reflect that sentiment when he attends the King\u2019s coronation on Saturday in London.",
        "Mr Albanese told the Australian Broadcasting Corp: \u201cI haven\u2019t changed my position on that and I\u2019ve made that very clear. I want to see an Australian as Australia\u2019s head of state.\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that you cannot have respect for the institution, which is the system of government that we have,\u201d he said.\u201cAnd I believe, as the Australian prime minister, I have a particular responsibility to represent the nation in a way that respects the constitutional arrangements, which are there.\u201dThe Australian Republic Movement, which campaigns for Australia to become a republic, has urged Mr Albanese to remain silent when the Archbishop of Canterbury invites \u201call who desire\u201d among the congregation at Westminster Abbey to take the oath of allegiance to the King.But Mr Albanese said he would follow protocol by taking the oath, though his office did not respond when asked if the Australian leader intended to affirm or swear his allegiance to the king.",
        "\u201cI think as the Australian prime minister, people expect me to not come to the King\u2019s coronation in order to create a controversy,\u201d Mr Albanese said.Brought up as a Roman Catholic, Mr Albanese opted against swearing an oath on a Bible a year ago when he was appointed prime minister by Governor-General David Hurley, who was then Australia\u2019s representative of the late Queen.He took an affirmation of office, a secular alternative to the oath that does not mention God or the monarch.",
        "Mr Albanese\u2019s eclectic Australian delegation to the coronation includes Mr Hurley and all six state governors.The delegation will be led by Australian women\u2019s football star Sam Kerr, who currently plays for Chelsea; post-punk pioneer musician Nick Cave; and comedian Adam Hills.As a coronation gift, the Australian government will donate 10,000 Australian dollars (\u00a35,300) to a charity that conserves the Western ground parrot, an endangered Australian bird.Mr Albanese has ruled out holding a referendum to replace the British monarch with an Australian president during his first three-year term in office.This year, he is prioritising a referendum that would recognize Indigenous Australians in the constitution and create a representative body to advise the parliament on Indigenous issues.While Mr Albanese has appointed a minister responsible for the republic, he has not provided a time frame for when Australians will get to vote on such a constitutional change."
