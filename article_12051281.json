        "Blasick revealed that Foxx, 55, was alert enough to be texting with her, and she claimed that a mutual friend who was close with the Oscar winner assured her that he was getting better, according to ET.The actress, who costarred with the recuperating actor in his shelved film All-Star Weekend, was in Los Angels to attend the John Ritter Foundation's 20th Anniversary Fundraiser:\u00a0An Evening From the Heart.Foxx has been on the mend in an Atlanta-area hospital since he suffered a medical emergency in April during the filming of his upcoming Netflix action comedy Back In Action, which marks the return \u2014 and possible final film \u2014 of Cameron Diaz.Blasick wasn't the only one to indicate the actor was improving, as his friend Kevin Hart also said he was 'getting better.'\u00a0",
        "'I was texting him, and just yesterday I talked to his friend, who's like really in touch with him,' Blasick said. 'I was, like, really freaking out [with] all of the news that he's getting worse.\u00a0'So I was texting [his friend], and he's like, \"No, no, no, he's recovering.\" So just hearing that he was recovering made me feel so much better,' she added.'I'm just praying. And my friend yesterday reached out to me, and she's like, \"Let's pray together.\" I mean, it's really crazy,' Blasick continued. 'All we have in this world is our health. Our life.
