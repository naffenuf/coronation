        "An Irish Government minister has insisted there is no conspiracy behind new hate speech laws as he dismissed criticism levelled by Donald Trump Jnr and Elon Musk.",
        "Justice minister Simon Harris said when someone from the Trump family or Mr Musk took a contrary view it was \u201cnot a bad day at the office\u201d.Mr Harris said people portraying the new legislation as an attempt to police thought were seeking to misrepresent the intent of the laws. Funnily enough, I don't take my political philosophy from the Trump family or from Mr Musk or his associates  Simon Harris  Earlier in the week Mr Trump Jnr described the Criminal Justice (Incitement to Violence or Hatred and Hate Offences) Bill 2022 as \u201cinsane\u201d while Twitter owner Mr Musk said it was \u201cvery concerning\u201d.The Bill, which is progressing through the Irish parliament\u2019s upper house, the Seanad, having passed in the Dail, is the first specific legislation to deal with hate crime in Ireland.It is designed to make it easier to secure prosecutions for crimes targeting \u201cprotected characteristics\u201d such as race or sexual identity. It includes provisions to prosecute people for hate speech or possessing hateful material.On Friday, Mr Harris was asked about the issue at the opening of a new Garda call-handling facility in Dublin city centre.",
        "\u201cAny time Donald Trump and Elon Musk have a different view to you is not a bad day at the office,\u201d he said.",
        "\u201cAnd, funnily enough, I don\u2019t take my political philosophy from the Trump family or from Mr Musk or his associates.\u201cThe reality here is there\u2019s people trying to overstate things here for whatever reason. That\u2019s fine, we live in a democracy and let people have their debate.\u201cThis legislation went to Dail Eireann. There\u2019s not much that the Opposition and the Government agree on, (yet) overwhelmingly the Dail passed this legislation, because it\u2019s not about policing thought, it\u2019s not about stopping freedom of expression.",
        "\u201cWhat it is about though is keeping people safe and making sure that people can go about their lives and not be discriminated against and have a result of that discrimination seeing them often be physically assaulted, or incitement to hatred in relation to them.\u201dMr Harris said critics need to \u201ctake a little step back\u201d and consider what the Bill contains.\u201cFreedom of speech, freedom of expression \u2013 these are protected rights. We have a constitution, and we\u2019re members of the European Union, we\u2019re proud members of the United Nations,\u201d he said. It's absolutely your right to say offensive things... but it's... absolutely not your right to say something that incites hatred or danger towards another person  Simon Harris  \u201cThis is a country where only as recently as this week you saw in the new press freedom survey Ireland go up four places. We\u2019re seeing our defamation laws be reformed.",
        "\u201cThis is a country that values free speech and indeed I even said myself when speaking at committee stage on this legislation, it\u2019s absolutely your right to say offensive things, that\u2019s absolutely your right in a democracy, but it\u2019s not your right, absolutely not your right, to say something that incites hatred or danger towards another person, absolutely not your right to try and whip up homophobic activity and violence, homophobic violence against people, it\u2019s absolutely not your right.\u201cAnd when you talk to people who are often subject to such attacks, I think they\u2019ll tell you what they see and what they feel when it comes to hate speech.\u201cSo there\u2019s been an attempt by some, for whatever reason, to go about misrepresenting that. Best wishes to them, it\u2019s their right in a democracy to do that.\u201cBut when you see Donald Trump, junior or senior, whatever, a member of the Trump family and Elon Musk opposing your legislation, and when you say Fine Gael, Fianna Fail and the Greens (government parties) and Sinn Fein, Labour (opposition parties), all these people coming together to vote in favour of something, you know there\u2019s no conspiracy here.\u201d"
