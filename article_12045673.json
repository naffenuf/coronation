        "The SNP\u2019s former spin doctor said he is confident the police investigation into the party\u2019s finances will not result in any charges, as he spoke publicly about the probe for the first time.",
        "Murray Foote was head of communications for the SNP until standing down in March after a row about the party providing inaccurate membership figures to the media during its leadership election, saying he had passed them on in \u201cgood faith\u201d.The former Daily Record editor wrote in the newspaper on Thursday that he is prepared to gamble on there being no charges after the investigation is concluded.Mr Foote speculated on the veracity of the probe, codenamed Operation Branchform, and whether it is a \u201cwild goose chase\u201d, branding it a \u201cgrotesque spectacle\u201d.Former chief executive Peter Murrell and ex-treasurer MSP Colin Beattie were both arrested as part of the investigation, but later released without charge.",
        "Mr Foote wrote: \u201cI\u2019m not saying Branchform is a wild goose chase \u2013 but what if it is?\u201cSurely it\u2019s worth considering. Actually, if we cherish the presumption of innocence, then a no charges outcome must be at least considered.\u201cAnd the fallout would have serious consequences for the investigating authorities.\u201cGiven the grim spectacle at the house Peter Murrell shares with Nicola Sturgeon and at the party HQ, it\u2019s inconceivable the authorities would be so cavalier without slam dunk evidence, right?\u201dMr Foote then compared the situation to Rangers where administrators David Whitehouse and Paul Clark were falsely arrested over the football club\u2019s financial woes.",
        "\u201cThe legal costs over the wrongful pursuit of those involved in the administration and purchase of the Ibrox club are upwards of \u00a350 million,\u201d he wrote.\u201cSo, the authorities have previous for high-profile inquiries collapsing in scandal.\u201cIf they have spectacularly misjudged this one too, then the reputational cost will be far more substantial than the cash spent on manpower.\u201cBy the way, I\u2019m not criticising the investigation itself. If the police receive a complaint, it\u2019s their duty to investigate.\u201dThe former spin doctor said the sight of forensic tents outside of the home of former first minister Ms Sturgeon and Mr Murrell was \u201cextraordinary\u201d and a \u201cgrotesque circus\u201d.Mr Foote said Mr Beattie and Mr Murrell are highly unlikely to be \u201cmaster criminals\u201d.",
        "\u201cWhat I do know, however, is something of the character of the two men arrested to date and, in Peter Murrell and Colin Beattie, two less likely master criminals you will struggle to meet.\u201cFirstly, Peter\u2019s loyalty to his wife is unquestionable.\u201cFirst minister Sturgeon and her husband lived under crushingly intense scrutiny.\u201cIt is inconceivable to me that Peter would so much as consider doing something dodgy lest it rebound and put his wife in jeopardy.\u201dInstead, Mr Foote attacked the Conservatives, saying they know they are the \u201creal party of corruption\u201d, and accused them of exploiting the situation.",
        "On Wednesday, First Minister and SNP leader Humza Yousaf spoke of his relief over appointing new auditors.The party had been without auditors since late 2022.Mr Yousaf has said he only found out about the situation after he became party leader in March.He said: \u201cWe take our statutory obligations extremely seriously, so it is welcome news that AMS Accountants Group will complete the accounts for both the party and the SNP Westminster group.\u201cThere is hard work ahead, but it is really encouraging to have them on board as we work towards challenging deadlines.\u201dScottish Conservative MSP Annie Wells said:\u00a0\u201cMurray Foote may have quit his post but this highly speculative article shows he\u2019s still happy to spin for his former employer, the SNP.\u201cMr Foote\u2019s faith in Peter Murrell\u2019s character will raise a few eyebrows, given it was the former chief executive\u2019s lies over SNP membership figures which led to his own resignation.\u201d"
