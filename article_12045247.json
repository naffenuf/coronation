        "BERLIN, May 4 (Reuters) - BMW reported on Thursday an earnings margin of 12.1% in the first quarter of 2023 for its automotive segment, up from 8.9% a year earlier, confirming its outlook for 2023 on rising sales.",
        "The carmaker attributed a major drop in group earnings before tax - to 5.1 billion euros ($5.65 billion) from 12.2 billion last year - to the one-time effects from the full consolidation of its Chinese joint venture, BMW Brilliance Automotive, last year. ($1 = 0.9022 euros) (Reporting by Victoria Waldersee; Editing by Maria Sheahan)"
