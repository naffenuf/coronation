        "The music streaming service announced Friday that Sheeran will kick off the second season of Apple Music Live on May 10. The British pop star performed his fifth studio album \"Subtract\" for the first time at Eventim Apollo in London.Sheeran hit the stage in a pre-recorded show alongside a 12-piece band that includes The National\u00b4s Aaron Dessner, who produced \"Subtract,\" which releases Friday. The four-time Grammy winner's performance of his 14-track album will also be streamed on Apple TV+.The announcement comes a day after a New York jury found that Sheeran didn\u00b4t copy Marvin Gaye\u00b4s classic 1970s tune \"Let\u00b4s Get It On\" to create his hit song \"Thinking Out Loud.\" After the verdict, he joked that he won\u00b4t have to follow through on his threat to quit music.\"I\u00b4m delighted to share my `Subtract\u00b4 album show with you,\" Sheeran said in a statement Friday. \"I was really nervous on the day, as it was my first time performing the new album tracks. The show was brought to life by Aaron and the incredible band, and it was an honor to stand beside them. It was an emotional night, but I\u00b4m so pleased we got to document it.\"Apple Music Live returns after its inaugural season kicked off last year with performances by Harry Styles, Billie Eilish, Mary J Blige and Alicia Keys. Other performances include Lil Durk, Luke Combs and Wizkid.",
        "\"We\u00b4re excited to present this Apple Music Live show, which offers an utterly unique perspective into how one of the world\u00b4s most popular musicians is dealing with some of the heaviest traumas imaginable,\" said Apple Music 1 host Matt Wilkinson. \"It\u00b4s an emotional, soul-searching ride - but also extremely fulfilling.\""
