        "Walking-wounded Kieran Foran and rookie winger Alofiana Khan-Pereira have inspired Gold Coast to a 26-24 NRL Magic Round defeat of Parramatta, who lost halfback Mitchell Moses to a category-one concussion late in the game.",
        "Moses picked up his injury attempting to tackle 19-year-old debutant Keano Kini in the final 10 minutes of Sunday's match and will miss at least next week's game against Canberra as part of the league's head injury policy.The Titans' second upset victory in as many weeks puts their record-equalling capitulation against the Dolphins firmly in the rear-view mirror and moves them into the top eight after round 10.Foran's first try-scoring double since 2015 and Khan-Pereira's fifth in nine NRL games set the Titans on the path to victory but their usual lapses in concentration meant they were never able to shake free of the persistent Eels.Dylan Brown was outstanding in a losing effort for the Eels, finishing with 227 run metres and setting up two tries, the second after Moses left the field and the Eels needed a hero to help them back into the game.In the end, only Tanah Boyd's superior goal-kicking separated the sides, who scored five tries apiece in the final game of the NRL's annual football festival at Suncorp Stadium.Five-eighth Foran had been in doubt for Sunday's game after requiring six stitches in his finger, strapping on his knee and a pain-killer in his toe to get through the win over Manly. But he made his presence felt early.",
        "Eels fullback Clint Gutherson found himself sin-binned for holding Alofiana Khan-Pereira back in a try-scoring situation and only 20 seconds later, David Fifita wrestled free of three defenders and offloaded to his five-eighth.The try was Foran's first in over a year but only two minutes later, the veteran had his second, dummying to beat Andrew Davey and Will Penisini in a brilliant individual effort.Khan-Pereira twice bamboozled Gutherson to record his own double, first chipping and chasing past the fullback and then intercepting the fullback's pass to run 95 metres and score.Eels winger Maika Sivo had the first four-pointer of the night after a Titans error in the ruck, and continued to haunt the Gold Coast defence as he moved into outright first on the try-scoring ladder with two more tries.Brown had the Eels back within two points when he broke free and found Andrew Davey in the journeyman's first game since re-joining Parramatta last week.But time favoured the Titans, who closed Magic Round out on a high."
