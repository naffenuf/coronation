        "Galtier recently denied any wrongdoing\u00a0after he was alleged to have made a racist comments about several of his players.\u00a0On the pitch, Paris have struggled to achieve expected targets, crashing out of the Champions League, despite reigning supreme at the top of the Ligue 1 table.\u00a0They were beaten 3-0 on aggregate by Bayern Munich in the last-16 of the tournament, in what was a disappointing and underwhelming end to their European cup run this season.After stuttering several times this season, the club were crowned French champions, albeit in muted conditions, after they drew 1-1 against second placed side Lens back in April.\u00a0Concerns are also mounting over the morale of some of their key players, with Mail Sport reporting in February\u00a0that senior squad members are unhappy with how the club's transfer business.\u00a0Things have been bubbling away at the club for some time, with reports last October suggesting Kylian Mbappe was 'at the centre of a PSG squad split', while more recently the World Cup winner took aim at the club on Instagram for using his image without his consent.\u00a0Meanwhile the club are set for a big rebuild, with concerns now mounting over Lionel Messi's future at the club, with the seven-time Ballon d'Or winner being linked with a move to Saudi Arabia.\u00a0",
        "The club suspended him last week\u00a0after he took an un-authorised visit to the Middle East.\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile, there is some good news after reports Sergio Ramos 'wants to stay at PSG' despite being linked with a move to Saudi Arabia.\u00a0The arrival of a figure of Mourinho's stature could help the club to keep some of their bigger stars, as well as attract more talents to the Parc des Princes.\u00a0Having spent time throughout some of Europe's top divisions, notably managing Real Madrid, Inter Milan, Manchester United and Tottenham, the 60-year-old is yet to manage in France, but certainly possess the experience, having won two Champions League titles to help the Parisians secure a European trophy.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0"
