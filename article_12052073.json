That's really sweet of you.'As they posed for the photo, Kate put her arm around Louis.'Keep up the hard work,' she said, after giving him a gentle squeeze on the shoulder.\u00a0Sharing the footage with his followers, Louis wrote: 'Many have reached out, and asked what the Princess and I talked about.

I'm like, \"what do I do?!\"\u00a0She then took another selfie with a fan further down the crowd before asking them if they had travelled far to get to London that day.\u00a0In the background, a member of the public called out in the background: 'Kate, can I get a selfie? I'm late for my meeting.'\u00a0",
        "Warning of the tourists of the potential risk of rain tomorrow, she added: 'I hope you enjoy it. But I was just saying, make sure you find yourself an umbrella!\u00a0'It might rain.
