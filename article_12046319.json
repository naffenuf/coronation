        "49 cases have been recorded\u00a0so far in 2023, compared to 54 for all of 2022\u00a0Read more:\u00a0 UK should routinely jab babies against chickenpox, scientists sayParents have been urged to check their children's vaccinations are up to date amid a surge in measles cases this year.",
        "The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has so far detected 49 cases of measles, which causes a high fever, sore, red and watery eyes and a blotchy rash.\u00a0This is almost equal to the 54 cases of the virus, which spreads 'very easily' and can lead to hospitalisation, disability and death in severe cases, recorded in England for the whole of 2022.Health chiefs, who described the outbreak as 'concerning', warned that one in six children have not had their measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, which is given to children aged one, with a second dose at three years and four months.But they said it is 'never too late to catch up' and urged parents to\u00a0get their kids the potentially life-saving jabs before the summer \u2014 when global travel and crowded festival events can make it easier for measles to spread.",
        "Dr Vanessa Saliba, consultant epidemiologist at UKHSA, said: 'We are calling on all parents and guardians to make sure their children are up to date with their 2 MMR doses.'It's never too late to catch up, and you can get the MMR vaccine for free on the NHS whatever your age.'She warned while measles is usually mild, there was always the risk of a fatal outcome.\u00a0\u00a0",
        "'Measles spreads very easily and can lead to complications that require a stay in hospital and on rare occasions can cause lifelong disability or death, so it is very concerning to see cases starting to pick up this year,' she said.\u00a0",
        "Vaccinations for various unpleasant and deadly diseases are given free on the NHS to children and teenagers.Here is a list of all the jabs someone should have by the age of 18 to make sure they and others across the country are protected:Eight weeks old6-in-1 vaccine for\u00a0diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, polio, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), and hepatitis B.Pneumococcal (PCV)RotavirusMeningitis B\u00a012 weeks oldSecond doses of 6-in-1 and Rotavirus\u00a016 weeks oldThird dose of 6-in-1Second doses of PCV and men.

        "Cold-like symptoms, including a high temperatures, a runny or blocked nose, sneezing, a cough and red, sore and watery eyes, are usually the first signs of a measles infection.A few days later, small white spots may appear inside the cheeks and on the back of the lips.A rash, made up of raised red blotchy patches that join together, usually appears on the face and behind the ears before spreading to the rest of the body.\u00a0Symptoms usually improve within a few weeks and be managed by drinking plenty of fluids and taking paracetamol or ibuprofen to relieve a fever.",
        "However, if measles spread to the lungs or brain, it can cause pneumonia, meningitis, blindness and seizures.\u00a0London is currently the nation's measles outbreak hotspot with 33 cases. Children aged one to four the worst hit.The capital's vulnerability to the virus has been highlighted before with up to a third of children in some boroughs having gone without their measles jabs.\u00a0The South West and North East, the next worst-hit regions, have detected six and three, respectively.\u00a0Two cases have been spotted in each of the East Midlands, South East and East of England, while there is one in the North West.So far this year, no cases have been spotted in the West Midlands and Yorkshire and the Humber.Experts said the spike in England is being echoed on a global level after childhood immunisations programmes were disrupted by the Covid pandemic.This has resulted in some cases being imported to Britain, with a quarter of the cases detected this year being imported from other countries, according to the UKHSA.\u00a0It said the remainder were a result of community transmission within England itself, including a cluster of cases related to a school outbreak.Nationally, 40 per cent of cases detected so far in 2023 are among children aged under five.\u00a0",
        "Professor Helen Bedford, an expert in child public health at University College London, said the rises in cases was 'worrying but not surprising'.\u00a0She said: 'Unfortunately, we have seen a decline in MMR vaccine uptake in recent years. MMR vaccine uptake is now less than 90 per cent.'Measles is so highly infectious that even a small decline in uptake can result in outbreaks \u2013 we need to maintain uptake of 95 per cent of two doses of MMR vaccine to prevent such outbreaks.'Professor Bedford said Covid making measles seem like less of a threat, a rise in vaccine hesitancy and GP pressures could be blame for the decline in uptake.\u00a0She said: 'There may be some vaccine hesitancy, though surveys by UKHSA and others suggest this isn't a major reason in the UK. However, such surveys often do not capture everyone's, particularly those with more extreme, anti vaccine, views.\u00a0",
        "'Fewer health visitors and pressure on general practice, are both likely contributing to lower vaccine uptake.;Health chiefs are now urging parents of young children, teenagers, as well as adults themselves, to check they are up to date on the MMR vaccination.They can do this by checking their child's\u00a0red book or contacting their GP practice. Those who have missed one or both doses can book an appointment with their GP.",
        "Uptake for the MMR has plunged in recent years with data suggesting one in 10 of 2- year-olds haven't had it, with almost one in 6 of five-year-olds also missing out.\u00a0This well below the 95 per cent vaccine target set by the\u00a0World Health Organization, a level which helps prevent isolated cases spilling out into an outbreak.\u00a0Data suggests that 20million measles cases and 4,500 deaths in the UK have been prevented since the first vaccine targeting the virus was deployed in 1968.\u00a0\u00a0Parents can check their children's MMR vaccinations by checking their vaccine record in their Red Book.Anyone who has not had two doses of the MMR vaccine can contact their GP surgery to book an appointment.Symptoms of measles include a high fever, sore red watery eyes and a blotchy red brown rash.While usually mild it can require a stay in hospital in some cases.Serious cases of\u00a0measles can lead to\u00a0pneumonia, meningitis, and even long-term disability or death."
