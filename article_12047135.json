        "Vlogger Hank Green was replying to a TikToker who asked 'what is this thing'\u00a0A TikToker has offered an explanation of why people get chin dimples - but some were upset to hear the description.\u00a0",
        "Vlogger Hank Green was replying to a social media user who asked 'what is this thing' while sharing a picture of his chin dimples.\u00a0Mr Green said they are caused by\u00a0the mentalis muscle which connects from bone to skin and creates dimples on your skin when you flex it.\u00a0'You can see the mentalis here, doing an absolutely wild thing, sticking all of its little muscle fibres into your skin', he added sharing an image of the muscle.'When you contract that muscle, it yanks. It yanks on the skin and makes those little dimples.",
        "'It's a little weird. We're all made out of meat.'But readers appeared to be disturbed by the explanation.\u00a0One thanked Mr Green but added - 'Never speak of this again.'Another said: 'This makes me nauseous.'And a third commented: 'I am so upset that I now know this information'.One reader, according to LadBible, even went as far as saying:\u00a0'I'm sorry but I REALLY hate knowing this and it's gonna haunt me for a long time.'A description on Aesthetics Life medical spa says: 'A dimpled chin occurs because some of us naturally contract our chin more than others on opening and closing our mouth.\u00a0'It develops when the mentalis muscle, which inserts with several fibres in the dermis of this area, is contracted.'"
