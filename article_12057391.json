        "Charles and Camilla laughed and chatted as they bopped along, with Kate, Charlotte and George also getting into the groove -\u00a0as did the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh.William had slipped away so he could go on stage to give a moving tribute to his father,\u00a0telling him: 'Pa, we are all so proud of you.'\u00a0He also told King Charles that he had no doubt the late Queen Elizabeth, his 'very proud mother', would be 'fondly' looking down from heaven on his Coronation weekend.Princess Charlotte attempted to get Prince George's attention and pointed at her father the Prince of Wales as he made his way onto the stage to deliver a speech during the Coronation Concert.",
        "As William concluded his speech, he said: 'God Save the King,' which was repeated loudly by the thousands in attendance. The speech was followed by the national anthem, which was sung by all present, including Prince George. The King smiled and waved to the crowd at the end of the national anthem.The concert is considered by many to be a crowning touch on the magnificent weekend, after joyous big lunch celebrations today and a surprise walkabout by the Prince and Princess of Wales.Among the celebrities to perform on stage will be the royal family's own Prince William, who will deliver a speech.",
        "Reflecting on his thoughts surrounding the royal family ahead of the concert, host Mr Bonneville said: 'I think each generation will need to make its own definition of what monarchy means.'And I think that is the challenge for the future. In our ever-changing world, where does the monarchy stand? What does it mean?'I mean, for my generation, and for my parents' generation, it was the glue that bound our nations together, and that glue will need to shift and evolve in order to keep the strength that it's had in the past.'Bonneville said he thought the coronation service was 'extraordinary' and admitted that he found the moment the King swapped his 'robes of status and honour' for a simple white shirt for the private anointing as 'particularly touching'.",
        "He added: 'It's a crazy old service, it's strange to think how it's accreted over the years, over the centuries to what it is today and it obviously will have a new meaning, a different meaning for our generation, the generation that witnessed it with the late majesty.'I found it moving and an extraordinary change-marker in the sand for our culture and for our generation.'The\u00a0show in Windsor also saw performances by Paloma Faith, Olly Murs, veteran rock guitarist Steve Winwood, and Nicole Scherzinger of The Pussycat Dolls.Classical acts including Andrea Bocelli, Welsh bass-baritone Sir Bryn Terfel and Chinese pianist Lang Lang are also on the bill.Hollywood star Tom Cruise, Dynasty actress Dame Joan Collins, adventurer Bear Grylls, singer Sir Tom Jones and former Strictly Come Dancing professional Oti Mabuse will also make an appearance via video."
