        "\u00a0READ MORE: Has Covid created a generation of germaphobesYou\u2019d be hard-pressed to find someone who didn\u2019t know that air pollution is bad for health \u2014 as a report by England\u2019s Chief Medical Officer, Chris Whitty, recently pointed out, it kills up to 36,000 Britons every year.",
        "However, once we\u2019re home and have closed the door and windows to this outside harm, we tend to think we can relax and breathe easy, away from these toxic fumes.But not so: there\u2019s plenty of air pollution indoors, and it can also be lethal, with research suggesting even our gas cookers are a health hazard, as a major cause of asthma.If this surprises you \u2014 as it did me \u2014 how worried should we be about such findings, and should we be trying to switch to electricity?Not so long ago I treated a young man who\u2019d come to A&amp;E with chronic headaches, nausea and feeling weak. He and his GP had put it down to stress and loneliness; stress from his new job and loneliness from working from home.",
        "On the face of it, his self-diagnosis made sense \u2014 except for the additional symptoms that sent him to A&amp;E. Over the previous couple of days he had become confused and forgetful. These are not signs of stress.And then he told me about his brother who stayed with him at weekends and who would get a headache each time \u2014 only for it to disappear when he went away during the week.This was the clue that gave away the diagnosis in an instant: and indeed, when I checked the patient\u2019s levels of carboxyhaemoglobin, they were raised. He had carbon monoxide poisoning.",
        "The treatment was simple: we immediately gave him oxygen \u2014 and crucially, we advised him to get his gas boiler serviced or replaced, and to prevent future problems he needed a carbon monoxide monitor.If this 20-something hadn\u2019t come to us then, he might have died within days. Nor is his an isolated case. A review in last month\u2019s BMJ Best Practice reported this indoor lethal air pollutant claimed the lives of 43 people in the UK in 2021 \u2014 many of these deaths preventable with regular boiler checks and a carbon monoxide monitor costing less than \u00a320.Less instantly lethal, but harmful nonetheless, other indoor air polluters include wood burners (even \u2018eco-design\u2019 burners produce 450 times more toxic particles than central heating) and candles (perfumed candles release chemicals that can trigger asthma).",
        "Since learning this, I\u2019ve ditched the lime and bay candles we used to burn at home.But indoor air pollution also comes from other sources that we can\u2019t really avoid, such as cooking.A study in 2019 by the University of Colorado in the U.S. found that cooking a Sunday roast can create as much pollution inside the house as is found in the air of the dirtiest of cities around the world.Frying and roasting are particularly bad \u2014 they release loads of tiny particles (\u2018particulate matter\u2019) that can get deep into the blood vessels and lungs.",
        "The fuel we use to cook matters, too. Cooking with gas stoves produces nitrogen dioxide as well as releasing particulate matter, and both can induce asthma attacks \u2014 even if the cooker is turned off because of the slow leakage of gas.A study recently published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health estimated that a surprisingly high number \u2014 nearly 13 per cent \u2014 of cases of childhood asthma in the U.S. were attributable to the use of gas cookers.The researchers calculated this based on studies that showed higher rates of asthma in households that used gas cookers compared with electric stoves.The data on increased risks came from a meta-analysis \u2014 combining a number of studies; these were all observational, where you look at two factors \u2014 a potential cause (i.e. having a gas cooker) and a potential impact (i.e. developing asthma).While this means we cannot be 100 per cent sure that the gas cooker is the cause of the increased risk of asthma, it is nevertheless a credible proxy.Because to completely prove that gas is the cause, you would need to do a study where you randomly allocate children to living in houses with gas or electric cookers and then compare asthma rates \u2014 and for obvious reasons, this would be unethical.",
        "Observational data is often not thought of as \u2018good science\u2019 compared with controlled trials, but that does not mean it should be discounted.For example, the evidence linking smoking to cancer comes from observational studies.In my view, the indoor air pollution study is robust and because of how common asthma is, I\u2019ve decided to change my gas stove to a new induction hub.I\u2019m lucky, though; I can afford it, but many others can\u2019t.Changes to VAT rates to encourage people to buy non-gas cookers would help, as would legislation that meant those who are renting have induction electric cookers in their kitchens as standard.The bigger point is that we need to accept that our home could be a source of indoor pollution and do what we can to reduce it.First, make sure you have a carbon monoxide monitor and if you have a gas boiler, get it serviced every year.And however calming a wood burner might appear, resist the temptation to buy one.Also, avoid burning candles indoors, and when you cook, use an extractor fan \u2014 and think about steaming rather than frying or roasting.All this advice is even more important if you suffer from a respiratory condition such as emphysema or asthma.But perhaps the best thing we can all do is to go against what we naturally do: don\u2019t close the windows to keep pollution out \u2014 open them and let the fresh air in!",
        "Professor Galloway is on Twitter @drrobgallowayMathematicians at Sussex University have come up with the formula for how to reach sexual climax.They analysed data from different stages of the male arousal cycle in 10,000 people and found that too much psychological arousal early in the process can inhibit the chance of reaching climax.\u2018Simply put, our findings can be summarised as \u201cdon\u2019t overthink it\u201d,\u2019 the researchers said. It could have applications for the treatment of sexual dysfunction.Measles surge is a real worryI read with alarm last week about the surge in measles cases \u2014 new data shows that, while in 2022 there was a total of 54 cases of measles over the whole year, in just the first four months of 2023 there were 49.If this rate continues, it would mean there will be 147 cases this year \u2014 triple the number of last year. And behind the headlines stands one stark truth: parents believing false information and failing to give their child the MMR jab are squarely to blame.",
        "\u2018So what?\u2019 many will say: measles just causes a fever, cough, runny nose and watery eyes. That\u2019s true for most children, but many others will be left with significant complications, including blindness.I was a junior doctor in 1998 when Andrew Wakefield published a now discredited article in The Lancet, which concluded utterly incorrectly that the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) jab was linked to autism.",
        "I saw first-hand the impact of that false research. I was on a night shift when a very young boy was brought in to A&amp;E. He was very ill with measles \u2014 his mother had believed Wakefield\u2019s claims and had chosen not to get her son vaccinated with the MMR.The three-year-old was admitted to intensive care, and I will never forget his mum\u2019s face when I told her it was touch and go whether he would survive. He only just did, and was left badly brain damaged.According to the World Health Organization, 142,000 people died worldwide from measles in 2018. What\u2019s so sad is that it\u2019s preventable, yet because of lower immunisation rates, we are at risk of seeing an escalating toll.Currently, only 85 per cent of children in the UK get both MMR jabs, but because measles is so infectious, it needs to be 95 per cent. You need to have enough children immunised to create herd immunity, where the virus cannot spread across the population and so it slowly dies out.Without herd immunity, measles starts to spread and, as well as harming the children whose parents choose not to get them immunised, it affects those who may not be able to have the vaccination. This includes children undergoing chemotherapy and, if a child having cancer treatment gets measles, the impact can be devastating.So why is the MMR vaccine uptake now low? Partly, it\u2019s vaccination fatigue, post-Covid; I suspect the Covid anti-vaxxer movement has also given a fillip to the anti-jab movement generally. But the MMR vaccine is safe and effective, and there are many years of data to prove this.But I also think people just don\u2019t understand what a terrible impact measles can have. So please, to stop your child \u2014 as well as children who are suffering from cancer and can\u2019t be vaccinated \u2014 coming to harm, ensure your little one has the MMR vaccine."
