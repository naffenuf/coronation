        "Jaylon Tyson, a guard coming off a standout season at Texas Tech, announced Monday he is transferring to Cal.",
        "Tyson started all 31 games for the Red Raiders in 2022-23 and averaged 10.7 points, 6.1 rebounds, 1.3 assists and 1.4 steals per game.He was an offensive threat thanks to efficient shooting percentages: 48.3 percent from the field and 40.2 percent from the 3-point arc.Tyson began his career at Texas and played eight games there in 2021-22 before transferring to Lubbock. As a two-time transfer, Tyson will require a waiver from the NCAA to play right away.Tyson is the fifth player to commit to the Golden Bears since new coach Mark Madsen took over the program. He follows former Texas Tech teammate Fardaws Aimaq, along with Keonte Kennedy from Memphis, Jalen Cone from Northern Arizona and Mike Meadows from Portland.Cal went an abysmal 3-29 last season and fired coach Mark Fox, hiring Madsen to replace him. Madsen held the same position at Utah Valley, having led that program to a 28-9 record and a run to the NIT semifinals in 2022-23.A 6-foot-11 center, Aimaq won Western Athletic Conference Player of the Year honors in 2021-22 while playing for Madsen at Utah Valley.--Field Level Media"
