        "Pedro Pascal was a triple threat on Sunday night at the MTV Movie &amp; TV Awards 2023 where his hit show The Last of Us won three major awards.",
        "The 48-year-old star, who plays Joel in the series, delivered a trio of speeches to collect his golden popcorn trophies, and the first award saw him win big for Best Hero.\u00a0Getting emotional during his remarks, Pascal praised 'young people' as the 'real heroes' and told them that they 'deserve real heroes.''I want to say thank you, MTV Movie &amp; TV Awards,' he began. 'I am a child of MTV, I grew up on MTV. This means the absolute world to me.'I wish we could all be together so I could look into your eyes and tell you that all the young people in the world are my heroes and I wouldn't be here if it weren't for you.'\u00a0",
        "The Mandalorian star continiued: 'You deserve a world that serves your interests, you deserve to be healthy, you deserve to be safe, you deserve for your individual rights to be fought for and protected.'Concluding his remarks, Pascal said, 'You deserve real heroes in this world because you are real heroes to me.'The veteran actor's win for Best Hero saw him beat out fellow nominees\u00a0Diego Luna (Andor), Jenna Ortega (Wednesday), Paul Rudd (Ant-Man &amp; The Wasp: Quantumania), and Tom Cruise (Top Gun: Maverick).Pedro soon returned to the telecast in another pre-recorded video message when The Last of Us won Best Show, beating out Stranger Things, The White Lotus, Wednesday, Wolf Pack, Yellowjackets, and Yellowstone.",
        "'Thank you MTV Movie &amp; TV Awards,' he began. 'I am accepting these golden popcorns on behalf of show creators Craig Mazin, and Neil Druckmann, and our entire amazing cast and crew from the U.S. and from Canada, who worked tirelessly and passionately to make this show. They made it a family experience, one of the best experiences of my life.'The Game of Thrones alum went on to reference the writers strike that has brought Hollywood to a standstill and nearly upended the MTV Awards.\u00a0\u00a0He said: 'We are all thanking HBO and Naughty Dog, and standing in solitary with the WGA, that is fighting very hard for fair wages. We thank you, we love you. I'm going to take these [golden popcorns] to bed with me.'And third time was the charm for Pedro as he returned once more to accept the award for Best Duo, winning with his Last of Us co-star Bella Ramsey.",
