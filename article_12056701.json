        "Denise Welch was seen for the first time since her son Matty Healy and Taylor Swift\u00a0seemingly confirmed their romance.",
        "The singer, 33, is reportedly 'madly in love' with The 1975 frontman Matty, who watched her in the audience at her concert in Nashville.Denise stood out in a bright pink top and matching jeans, while completing the look with brown slip-on shoes.The Loose Women star, 64, opted for a blush makeup palette and donned her glasses while getting into her blue Abarth on Sunday.Taylor has already crossed paths with Matty's mother as the pair met in January while backstage at a 1975 concert at The O2 in London.",
        "The Bad Blood hitmaker appeared on stage with the band as a special guest and then posed for a snap with Denise backstage, which the Loose Women star shared to her Instagram.Before dating rumours emerged around Swift and The 1975 singer, Taylor had dated British actor, Joe Alwyn, for six years until their split was confirmed last month in April.Shortly after being spending time with the Midnights singer, supermodel Gigi as well as the three Haim sisters reportedly all unfollowed The Favourite star.It is hard to confirm if they ever followed Joe in the first place, but Taylor's observant and perceptive fans shared screenshots of the Victoria's Secret Angel's following list less than 24 hours later.Reports also show that the three sisters making up the rock band HAIM \u2014 Alana, Danielle, and Este \u2014 allegedly all followed suit.",
        "Joe still follows Alana and Danielle, but it is unclear if he and Este ever followed each other initially.The three sisters reportedly even unfollowed Joe on their official HAIM band account.Supermodels and Victoria's Secret Angels Martha Hunt and Lily unfollowed him too.",
        "Matty's appearance on stage during Taylor's Eras Tour comes shortly after The Sun reported earlier Thursday that the rumored couple had plans to confirm the romance over the weekend during her Nashville stop.According to the outlet, Healy is slated to perform two of her popular songs, with a source stating, 'Taylor and Matty have been planning their \u2018coming out\u2019 for a few weeks now, and are really excited just to go public with their love.'The insider further revealed, 'Neither of them want any secrets, or to hide away. The plan is for Matty to walk out on stage mid-show and play two songs.''They will chat to the audience and, at present, the idea is for them to confirm their romance with some kind of PDA \u2014 public display of affection. It won\u2019t be anything remotely cheesy though.'And on Saturday, Matty strummed on his guitar as he made an appearance with Taylor's supporting act during the show. Whether he will hop onto the stage once again to perform with the Blank Space hitmaker has yet to seen.",
        "Taylor and Matty's rumored romance first came to light earlier this week on Wednesday, with a separate source telling The Sun, 'She and Matty are madly in love.''It\u2019s super-early days, but it feels right. They first dated, very briefly, almost ten years ago but timings just didn\u2019t work out,' the insider added.",
        "In regards to her ex, the source informed the publication, 'Taylor and Joe actually split up back in February, so there was absolutely no crossover.''Both Matty and Taylor have been touring over the past few weeks, so it\u2019s been a lot of Face-Timing and texting but she cannot wait to see him again,' and added that the two stars, 'are incredibly supportive of their respective careers.''They are both massively proud and excited about this relationship and, unlike Taylor\u2019s last one \u2014 which was very much kept out of the spotlight, deliberately \u2014 she wants to \u2018own\u2019 this romance, and not hide it away.'While Taylor focuses on her Eras Tour, which is slated to conclude later this year in August, Matty is also in the middle of touring with his band, The 1975.Before making a surprise appearance to join the opening act, the Robbers musician was seen making a quick Starbucks run after reportedly spending time at Taylor's Nashville condo earlier Friday night.",
        "As the British-born singer exited the popular coffee shop chain on Saturday, he carried a warm drink in his hand while also looking through his smartphone as he was led by a security guard to a sleek, white SUV parked near the coffee shop.After grabbing a drink to get a boost of energy, Healy was later seen arriving at Nissan Stadium in the heart of Nashville ahead of Taylor's Saturday night performance in the city.Earlier on Friday, he was seen dancing along to Swift as she sang her hit track, Shake It Off, amongst fellow concert-goers in a secured area on the floor section of the venue.The video was posted on Twitter and quickly went viral amid rumors that Matty and Taylor have started a budding romance.Despite the speculation that the two have entered a relationship, both singers have yet to publicly confirm they are dating.Fans also were sent into a frenzy when the Karma songstress appeared to relay a message in code to her rumored boyfriend as he watched her concert from the audience in footage uploaded onto social media.At one point, she mouthed the words, 'This is about you, you know who you are. I love you' which is what Matty had also said amid his concert earlier this month on May 3 in the Philippines.",
        "Before night two of Taylor's Nashville stop, devoted fans of the Grammy winner were seen arriving to Nissan Stadium just hours before the concert commenced.Near the outdoor stadium that is located in the heart of the bustling city, concert goers were seen dressed up for the event and also took a few photos near a large sign that read 'TSWIFT.'Nissan Stadium notably has a capacity of nearly 70,000, and the singer-songwriter has been performing for sold-out crowds. She is slated to perform in Nashville through Sunday May 7, with her tour coming to an end later this year in August in Los Angeles.During night one of the festivities on Friday, Taylor made a surprise announcement that her Speak Now (Taylor's Version) album will be released later on July 7, per Variety."
