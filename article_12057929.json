        "Cyclist Sir Bradley Wiggins has named coach who abused him when he was 12Stan Knight, who was 72, molested him as a boy at Archer Road Club, LondonREAD MORE: Bradley Wiggins opens up on the painful secret after sexual abuseThe coach who sexually abused Olympic cyclist Sir Bradley Wiggins\u00a0as a boy has been named.",
        "Stan Knight was reportedly named as the cycling coach who abused Wiggins, and other children at the club, when he was just 12 years old.Another of Knight's victims has talked about abuse that was akin to that experienced by the Tour de France champion at the Archer Road Club in Acton, west London.Knight was also reported to British Cycling by the family of another boy - and allegations involving other young children were also raised.Knight has previously only been named by his first name by Wiggins.",
        "Wiggins said that Knight would take him for a training camp to a youth hostel\u00a0in Litton Cheney, Dorset - and while there sleep in the same bed as him and abuse him in the shower, the Times\u00a0reports.",
        "In the interview with the Times, Wiggins said that Knight, who died in 2003, would explain to him 'how to clean your crotch in the shower', saying that it was important he knew for the sport so he did not get saddle sore or infections.Wiggins told the paper that Knight showed him, as a schoolboy, how to 'lift your sac up with a scrubbing brush', adding that 'he actually demonstrated that on me, in the shower'.The cyclist said it was just one of the 'minor acts' that started the abuse when he was 12 and living at the youth hostel with 72-year-old Knight.",
        "Knight\u00a0also reportedly abused another victim in the 1990s at the same hostel by 'fondling' him during sports massages.The victim, who was a teenager when the abuse happened, said that Knight 'took advantage of this slightly blurred line between what's required to be fit and for the sport and what's not acceptable'.\u00a0They said that he went 'way beyond the boundaries' of what was needed to help with training and recovery by putting his fingers 'into places that you didn't want to'.The victim also said that Knight was a 'useless' coach and acted like a 'child' and an 'utter idiot' who used the club to be with the boys.They reportedly know that at least two other former club members were abused by Knight - but are now coming forward because Wiggins has.",
        "The cyclist said that his mother had received a letter from British cycling in 2003, when he was 23, which said they had got a complaint from the family of another boy trained by Knight who alleged similar abuse.But at the time, Wiggins said: 'Nah, nah, of course he didn't.' He says this 'cemented' him into a position of not saying anything.A British Cycling spokeswoman told the Times: 'Abuse of any kind has no place in sport. We urge anybody with concerns about non-recent or current abuse to report them... directly to the British Cycling safeguarding team.'"
