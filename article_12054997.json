        "The organiser of a King Charles spaniel parade on the day of King\u2019s coronation said the march was a \u201cfitting way\u201d to honour Charles.",
        "Jenny Matthews, owner of Love My Human \u2013 a pet groomers boutique on King\u2019s Road in Chelsea, led a parade of more than 150 dogs to celebrate Charles becoming King and to mark the first coronation in over 70 years.Ms Matthews said onlookers were in \u201cwonderment\u201d and that hosting the spaniel march was \u201ca no brainer\u201d.\u201cIt was fitting to honour King Charles today with a lot of King Charles spaniels,\u201d the 53-year-old told the PA news agency.",
        "\u201cI heard comments saying \u2018Oh my goodness, and there\u2019s more\u2019.\u201cI think everyone was charmed by it.\u201dSpaniels, young and old, were seen parading through King\u2019s Road passing luxury boutiques and some donned royal attire to mark the historic event.\u201cWe had much older dogs in pushchairs that came out and the owners decorated the pushchair with bunting and beautiful velvet purple throws,\u201d she said.\u201cOne of the stipulations was if you wanted to take part in the parade, and if your dog doesn\u2019t mind, can you get them to wear a crown? We saw all kind of crowns \u2013 homemade crowns, little shop bought ones, paper crowns and everybody was really keen to comply and we were hoping to create a spectacle.\u201cThere were lots of dogs wagging their tail down the street. We wanted to really make sure that everyone knew why we were there.\u201d",
        "The pet company owner was initially dubious that dog owners would not take part in the parade, but was \u201coverwhelmed\u201d to see the masses of King Charles spaniels walk King\u2019s Road.\u201cIt\u2019s been amazing and I really didn\u2019t think it would get the attention that it did,\u201d she said.\u201cFrom initially a few people taking up on it, and everyone loved the idea, then all of a sudden overnight 150 King Charles have registered on the Cavaliers of London site to want to take part.\u201cAt one stage I stood still to photograph the parade and it just went on and on and on.\u201d",
        "The parade started at 2pm and the party of dog owners and their spaniels was popular with the crowd as \u201ceverybody wanted to stop and take a photograph\u201d.Ms Matthews said: \u201cWe got to Dovehouse Green where we were meeting everyone to make our way over to the Duke of York Square, and I was just overwhelmed because everybody showed up.\u201dDespite the weather, people\u2019s spirits were not dampened, though Ms Matthews admits that the rain may have helped to limit numbers to make the event more manageable.She added: \u201cIt was just pouring with rain, and I thought \u2018yes, that\u2019s so British\u2019 \u2013 come rain or shine they\u2019re out with their dog and they didn\u2019t care they were getting wet.",
        "\u201cIn a way (the rain) did us a favour because I think everyone with a King Charles spaniel would have come out in force and it would have been overwhelming.\u201d"
