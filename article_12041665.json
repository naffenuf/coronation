        "Sir Keir Starmer has questions to answer over partygate investigator Sue Gray\u2019s refusal to co-operate with a Government probe into her switch to a senior Labour role, a minister has said.",
        "Security minister Tom Tugendhat said he was \u201csurprised\u201d the Labour leader was \u201cnot asking the person he nominated to co-operate with the civil service body that\u2019s investigating\u201d the move to become his chief of staff.But shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves described the inquiry as a \u201cpolitical gimmick\u201d launched by the Government to pursue a \u201cvendetta\u201d against the former senior official who looked into allegations of parties being held in Downing Street during pandemic lockdowns.In an update on Ms Gray\u2019s departure from her high-ranking Whitehall position on Tuesday, Cabinet Office minister Oliver Dowden said the Government will \u201cconsider next steps\u201d after she \u201cchose not to\u201d speak to the investigation. He's painted himself as a white knight in all this and he's not asking the person he nominated to co-operate with the civil service body that's investigating it  Tom Tugendhat, security minister  He said the Government has submitted a \u201cconfidential assessment\u201d to the anti-corruption watchdog, the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba), which will recommend a cooling-off period between three months and two years to avoid any conflict of interest.But he stopped short of saying whether the Cabinet Office deemed her to have broken any rules by talking to the opposition about a potential job while she was working in Government, as had been suggested by several reports.",
        "Ms Gray is \u201cfully\u201d co-operating with a separate review by Acoba, an independent body, Ms Reeves insisted on Wednesday.",
        "The Labour frontbencher told Times Radio: \u201cThe issue here is that there are two inquiries going on. There\u2019s the usual one \u2013 the Acoba process, which Sue Gray is co-operating with fully, and then there\u2019s the political gimmick one set up by Government ministers to pursue this vendetta they\u2019ve got against Sue Gray.\u201dShe said Prime Minister Rishi Sunak \u201cwas supposed to be moving on from the era of Boris Johnson\u201d but, instead, is \u201cdoubling down on this vendetta against Sue Gray because she\u2019s the person who \u2013 not the person who had the parties, but the person who revealed the extent of the partygoing and the debauched behaviour at 10 Downing Street\u201d.Dave Penman, leader of the FDA union which represents senior Whitehall staff, tweeted: \u201cIt is no surprise that Sue Gray has decided to focus on engaging with the independent, evidence-based Acoba investigation, rather than deal with an investigation that is mired in the politics of the day.\u201dBut Mr Tugendhat suggested Sir Keir should have pushed Ms Gray to co-operate with the Government probe.He told LBC Radio: \u201cI think the person I\u2019m most surprised at, frankly, is Keir Starmer.",
        "\u201cI mean, he\u2019s painted himself as a white knight in all this and he\u2019s not co-operating with the civil service or rather, he\u2019s not asking the person he nominated to co-operate with the civil service body that\u2019s investigating it.\u201cSo you know, I mean, that\u2019s a decision for him, obviously, but it does raise questions.\u201dSir Keir has insisted he was \u201cconfident\u201d Ms Gray had not broken any rules.The Labour leader said he \u201chad no discussions with her while she was investigating Boris Johnson whatsoever, I don\u2019t think anyone is suggesting that\u2019s the case\u201d."
