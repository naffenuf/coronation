        "INCHEON, South Korea, May 3 (Reuters) - Inflation is cooling rapidly in countries including Indonesia but policymakers should consider diverse factors driving the price changes after rapid rises last year, the country's finance minister told Reuters on Wednesday.",
        "Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati also said in an interview that Southeast Asia's largest economy was on a strong recovery path as the boost from China's reopening and robust domestic sectors offset downside factors relating to the advanced economies.On the issue of Indonesia's much delayed plan to introduce a carbon tax, Indrawati refused to say how close a decision on the new timing is, while emphasising that more time is needed for smooth communication between diverse stakeholders.She was speaking on the sidelines of the Asian Development Bank's annual meeting in South Korean city of Incheon.
