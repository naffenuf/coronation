        "Birdies on the closing two holes gave Tommy Fleetwood the first round lead in the Wells Fargo Championship as Rory McIlroy made solid return to action.",
        "Fleetwood shot a bogey-free 65 as he continued his pursuit of a first PGA Tour title, one better than a group on five under \u2013 Xander Schauffele, Kevin Streelman, Taylor Moore, KH Lee and Ryan Palmer.McIlroy, playing for the first time since missing the cut at the US Masters, is three strokes behind after an opening 68 on his 34th birthday at Quail Hollow.Fleetwood has won six times on the DP World Tour, but the Englishman is still chasing a first title in the US.\u201cI just have to keep going and wait for those really big results and hopefully start contending again up at the top of the leaderboard,\u201d said Fleetwood. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what we can do from there.\u201dMcIlroy has won three times at Quail Hollow with nine top 10 finishes in 11 starts, but he admitted not touching his clubs for more than two weeks after the disappointment at the Masters.\u201cI feel relaxed here,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a level of comfort at this golf course and at this club that I probably don\u2019t have any other venue.\u201cI\u2019ve played here so many times I know where to miss it. I missed a few greens but I didn\u2019t feel like I hit the ball that badly.",
        "\u201cIt was just really nice to be out there again\u2026 nice to feel like I played well. I didn\u2019t want to spend my birthday afternoon grinding on the range.\u201dSchaufelle had looked on course to set the early pace, but two bogeys in Quail Hollow\u2019s notorious closing three holes \u2013 dubbed the \u201cGreen Mile\u201d \u2013 left him one off the lead.US Open champion Matt Fitzpatrick finished a stroke behind playing partners McIlroy and Justin Thomas, his 69 matched by fellow Englishman Tyrell Hatton with defending champion Max Homa opening with a 70.English trio Matt Wallace, Callum Tarren and Harry Hall also opened with one-under-par 70s while Tony Finau, winner in Mexico last week, shot a 71."
