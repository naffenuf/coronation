        "May 3 (Reuters) - The Texas grid operator on Wednesday said it expects electricity demand in the state this summer to reach 82.7 gigawatts, topping last year's July record, but wind and solar will help keep the lights on.",
        "The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which operates a grid providing about 90% of the state's power load, last year met demand by asking residents to conserve power during peak times.\"We will be relying on renewable to keep the lights on... the increase in demand for electricity is outpacing the supply of on-demand dispatchable power,\" Peter Lake, chairman of the Public Utility Commission of Texas, said at a press conference on Wednesday, referring to the state's fossil fuel and nuclear-power supplies.ERCOT said its assessment of available resources projected 97.1 gigawatts of expected capacity for summer peak demand.Wind power will help meet peak demand on the hottest days, the state regulator said. State officials have been urging construction of new fossil-fuel plants that can be called on at times of peak demand and low wind or solar.One megawatt can power around 1,000 U.S. homes on a typical day, but only about 200 homes on a hot summer day in Texas.
