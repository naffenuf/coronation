        "Boss Roberto De Zerbi made four changes at half-time to try and turn the tide\u00a0The Toffees fans were loud - and rewarded with their earliest goal since 2017\u00a0Everton won 5-1 away at Brighton to step up their bid for Premier League safety\u00a0Everton took a huge step towards Premier League safety with a 5-1 win over Brighton on Monday evening.",
        "The Toffees started off in a rampant style, with Abdoulaye Doucoure scoring twice before Jason Steele's own goal made it 3-0 at the break.Dwight McNeil got two more in the second half at the Amex, while Alexis Mac Allister's goal ten minutes before time was just a consolation for the Seagulls.The win lifts Sean Dyche's side out of the relegation places, and dents Brighton's ambitions of a European place.Here, Mail Sport's Kieran Gill\u00a0talks about some of the more unusual talking points from Brighton's thumping defeat to Everton.\u00a0",
        "Roberto De Zerbi is not messing around\u00a0No messing around from Roberto De Zerbi. Trailing 3-0 at half time, the Brighton boss made four \u2013 yes, four \u2013 substitutions as Evan Ferguson, Julio Enciso, Solly March and Levi Colwill were all introduced.\u00a0The lethargy from Brighton in the first half was enough to make you wonder how much that midweek 1-0 win over Manchester United took out of them.\u00a0They could not handle Everton\u2019s energy and their passing was unusually poor. Brighton lost possession 74 times, making this their sloppiest first half of 2023 when you thought the slick surface from the South Coast downpour would suit their neat style of play.\u00a0Whenever they lost the ball, Everton broke forward in\u00a0numbers and were a constant threat, thanks to a game plan executed perfectly.",
        "Everton fans do their best to drown out 'God Save The King'Everton\u2019s travelling support did their best to drown out \u2018God Save The King'\u00a0by singing their own anthem, the renowned terrace chant Spirit of the Blues.\u00a0The dissent was to be expected after the shouting and whistling from Liverpool supporters at Anfield on Saturday.The Amex Stadium\u2019s away end was in tremendous voice throughout, especially as the visiting team defended their lead for their lives in the second half before scoring twice from breakaways to make this a five-star win.\u00a0",
        "An unwanted new record for Brighton\u00a0Abdoulaye Doucoure\u2019s goal after 34 seconds was the earliest Premier League goal ever conceded by Brighton.\u00a0It was also the quickest that Everton have scored since April 2017 (30 seconds against Leicester).\u00a0Top four could hand Brighton owner Tony Bloom UEFA headache\u00a0If you want to give yourself a headache, try wrapping your head around how the Belgian First Division works.\u00a0Union Saint-Gilloise \u2013 the other club owned by Brighton\u2019s Tony Bloom \u2013 finished second in the regular season.\u00a0But USG are now in a mini-tournament with their fellow top-four teams.\u00a0Each clubs\u2019 points total is halved and they face each other to decide who enters the Champions League, Europa League and Europa Conference League.\u00a0",
        "It could be problematic, should Brighton and USG qualify for the same competition, as UEFA prohibit clubs owned by the same person from competing against each other.\u00a0Yet there are ways to circumvent these rules \u2013 just look at the Red Bull outfits.\u00a0",
        "Tough day in the office for Kaoru Mitoma\u00a0Kaoru Mitoma has been sensational this season, emerging from obscurity to dazzle us all with his degree in dribbling.\u00a0Yet Brighton\u2019s left winger had little joy here, with Everton\u2019s right back Nathan Patterson and right winger Alex Iwobi often doubling up on him.\u00a0James Maddison save from suspension blowThere was confusion here as the Everton contingent thought James Maddison\u2019s 10th yellow card of the season meant he was now banned for Leicester's next two games, boosting their own survival chances.\u00a0That is not the case, however. It only applies if players pick up 10 cautions in Premier League matches up to and including their team's 32nd fixture, which Leicester have already passed.\u00a0Sorry, Everton, you won\u2019t get any extra help from suspensions!\u00a0"
