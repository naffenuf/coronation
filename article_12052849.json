        "'We knew she had been born very recently, like only hours earlier, because she still had the white stuff [vernix] on her head.'",
        "She said she thinks the newborn was cleaned up before being dumped in their backyard as there wasn't much blood on her.Ms Carlos recalled hearing the side gate slam loudly shut around 2pm, thinking at the time it was her brother-in-law.'But now we realise that must have been the mum or whoever left the baby here, and they closed it loudly so we would go out and find her. You don't bang a gate closed if you don't want to be heard,' she said.Anyone with information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.\u00a0"
