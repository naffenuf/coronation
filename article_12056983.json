        "Inge advises to ask for thorough consultation\u00a0with a\u00a0oculoplastic (eye) surgeon\u00a0READ MORE:\u00a0America's booming secret MALE plastic surgery industry revealedQ I was left with sunken eyes and one eye looking smaller than the other after an ultrasound anti-ageing treatment. Can anything be done to rectify this?",
        "A\u00a0I'm so sorry this has happened! I advise you to seek out a reputable oculoplastic (eye) surgeon who is also skilled in non-invasive treatments.Dr Elizabeth Hawkes is one such expert (drelizabethhawkes.com).'You will need to have a thorough consultation first to manage expectations and determine possibilities for the most natural results, as age does mean your face will change,' says Dr Hawkes.But she expects much can be achieved with a combination of expertly judged facial fillers (in the tear trough region, mid-face and temples, all to repair the eye structure), and neurotoxin around the eyes to soften lines and lift the brow tails to 'open' the eyes.",
        "She would charge from \u00a31,675.Additionally, if the upper lids are very droopy, a surgical upper eyelid lift is relatively quick and easy and would cost around \u00a35,500.And as an alternative to the dermal fillers, she says 'we can also look at fat grafting, a specialist and long-lasting technique in which fatty tissue from elsewhere in the body is injected underneath the skin in the eye region to replace lost volume'. That would cost from \u00a34,000.Email your questions to Ingeborg van Lotringen, author of Great Skin, at inge@dailymail.co.uk.\u00a0"
