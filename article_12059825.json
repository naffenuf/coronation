        "Boss Neil Wood had mixed emotions after Salford snuck into the play-offs despite losing 1-0 to Gillingham.",
        "The ambitious Ammies pipped Mansfield to seventh place by a single goal.Cheye Alexander\u2019s late penalty ensured a nervy end for the hosts and it got even worse when the Stags scored a late second at Colchester.But results eventually fell in their favour and they will now face Stockport in a tasty two-legged tie.\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to take the defeat because I don\u2019t think it was a penalty at all,\u201d said Wood. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing to concede a penalty to lose the game, but if you\u2019re looking at the overall picture, I\u2019m very pleased.\u201cI\u2019m very pleased with the players for their effort and all the hard work they\u2019ve put in all season. I think they deserve to be in the play-off spots, albeit we\u2019ve just about got in there.",
        "\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be Salford if we didn\u2019t get in that way over the last couple of weeks.\u201cIt\u2019s the first time the club have been in the play-offs in League Two and that\u2019s something we need to be proud of.\u201cWe\u2019re always making improvements. It would have been nice to finish it with a win.\u201cWe were waiting on Mansfield\u2019s result coming in. We were just stood on the pitch and a few of the staff had their apps out looking at the scores.",
        "\u201cYou\u2019re just waiting for that full-time whistle to go and there were a few cheers from the crowd and that was the signal that we were in there.\u201dThe Gills ended the season in style with a first away win in seven.And boss Neil Harris, who has masterminded a gutsy revival, said: \u201cI didn\u2019t quite know what to expect because it wasn\u2019t us last week, we were flat and lacked energy.\u201cI thought the performance was excellent. We streamlined the squad with the players we expect to have next season and the ones we won\u2019t didn\u2019t travel, and that gave us a real focus.\u201cI want to develop the group and advance the group. The club are going to try and support that with the business over the summer.\u201cI just want us to keep moving forward and be better. I want competition for places and I want us to start well in the summer.\u201cI want us to carry this momentum that we\u2019ve built into the first game next season.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen Orient celebrate on our pitch, we\u2019ve seen Salford celebrate today, we\u2019ve seen some good teams recently and we want a taste of that. That\u2019s why we\u2019re in the game.\u201cI don\u2019t want to big up our expectations for next year, that will come naturally. Our form in the second half of the season and the good players we\u2019ll hopefully sign, that expectation will be there.",
        "\u201cI don\u2019t want to put too much pressure on that now. I want us to enjoy what we\u2019ve achieved since January.\u201d"
