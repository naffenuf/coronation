        "Amad Diallo will return to Manchester United this summer on a mission to catch the eye of manager Erik ten Hag.",
        "The 20-year-old midfielder, a \u00a319million signing from Atalanta in January 2021, has been one of the stars of Sunderland\u2019s Sky Bet Championship campaign having endured a less than successful spell at Rangers during the second half of last season.United\u2019s loan manager Les Parry was on Wearside on Wednesday and Black Cats head coach Tony Mowbray, who admitted he wished the loan arrangement had been for two years, now expects the Ivory Coast international to get a chance to prove himself in pre-season.Mowbray said: \u201cI think Manchester United are happy, but I think the next step is for them to take him on pre-season to America. That\u2019s what I think is going to happen. Then they\u2019ll see how he gets on.\u201cThey know what they\u2019ve got, they bought him, but I think when the new manager came in, it was right on the cusp of whether they were going to keep him or not. He liked some of the stuff, but then he maybe wasn\u2019t sure about other things.\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s been watching Amad\u2019s clips from games, just as I watch all of our players who are out on loan, and seeing what he can do.",
        "\u201cBut he\u2019ll need to see him on a daily basis and feel what he brings. I\u2019m sure everyone will have an opinion on whether he\u2019s good enough or not good enough for Manchester United, but the reality is that the manager needs to watch him, see and feel him in a game, and see what he brings.\u201d",
        "Amad has made 39 appearances for Sunderland and scored 12 goals heading into Monday\u2019s trip to Preston, in which victory could yet propel the club into the play-offs at the end of their first campaign back in the second tier."
