Two years later, they picked Anthony Bennett.\"Nick inspired people everywhere with his bravery and brought joy to everyone he met,\" wrote Mike Duggan, the mayor of Detroit, on Twitter. \"All of Detroit has the Gilbert family in our prayers today.\"In 2017, the Gilberts launched a foundation that, according to the Detroit News, has funded more than $18 million in grants to research toward finding a cure for Type 1 neurofibromatosis.Last season, as the younger Gilbert underwent multiple surgeries, the Cavaliers joined with the Gilberts' foundation and the Children's Tumor Foundation to start the Bow Tie campaign to raise money for and awareness of neurofibromatosis.",
