        "The Toronto market's energy sector led the declines, down 4.6%, as oil settled 5.3% lower at $71.66 a barrel. Financials were also a drag, falling 1.8%.The materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, helped limit the TSX's losses. It added 1.9% as gold prices jumped. (Reporting by Fergal Smith in Toronto; Additional reporting by Shristi Achar A and Vansh Agarwal in Bengaluru; Editing by Shilpi Majumdar and Marguerita Choy)"
