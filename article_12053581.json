It\u2019s been years in the making, and we\u2019re hoping for a really successful delivery today.\u201cIt\u2019s a real honour to be part of this. It's absolutely phenomenal. I\u2019m just so proud of the trust that has been placed in us to move the personnel here today  Claire Mann  ",
        "As well as the delivery of troops into Waterloo, Ms Mann has also overseen the presentation of station staff and management of different teams across the station.She said: \u201cThere\u2019s the security piece around ensuring personnel are trained, and in presentation, making sure they\u2019re smart, the engineering, so it\u2019s been lots of teams coming together to ensure it\u2019s as smooth as it can be.\u201dAsked how she felt about facilitating such a significant logistical event, Ms Mann said: \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely phenomenal. I\u2019m just so proud of the trust that has been placed in us to move the personnel here today, but also to be at the heart of what\u2019s happening in London and the whole of the country and the world actually celebrating such an amazing event today.\u201d",
        "Network Rail route manager Mark Killick said: \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic for us as the rail industry to be involved in this great coordination celebration.\u201cThis is a huge thing for rail, so for colleagues across the industry and network around South Western Railway, it\u2019s just a massive privilege to be involved to be able to support the great coronation today.\u201cIt\u2019s been a huge amount of planning, we\u2019ve had to reschedule big engineering work that was planned for this weekend to make sure that the railways open and the trains can run.",
        "\u201cWe\u2019ve worked closely with South Western Railway, with the Ministry of Defence, with the British Transport Police, to make sure those arrangements run smoothly.\u201cKey for me today is making sure that those trains depart on time and we get those armed services personnel into London bang on time so they can get off and do what they need to do.\u201d"
