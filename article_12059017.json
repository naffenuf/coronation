Every side believes it is capable of winning the battle,\" the diplomat added.The UN's top humanitarian official, Martin Griffiths, arrived in Jeddah on Sunday intending to meet representatives of both camps, though his role in the process is unclear.A spokesperson for Griffiths said on Sunday that he had arrived in Jeddah \"to engage in humanitarian issues related to Sudan\".A separate UN official said on Monday that Griffiths had \"asked to join the negotiations\" but that his request had not been approved so far.",
