        "Former world eventing champion Ros Canter is within touching distance of a first Badminton Horse Trials title after she conquered punishing cross-country conditions to take pole position.",
        "Lincolnshire-based Canter flourished with Lordships Graffalo \u2013 Badminton runners-up behind Laura Collett last year \u2013 on a day when many combinations floundered.Double Olympic medallist Tom McEwen described the stamina-sapping going as \u201chorrific\u201d, and none of the starters threatened to jump clear inside the optimum time.",
        "Canter collected 11.6 time penalties for an overnight score of 33.7, putting her nine penalties clear of Irish challenger Austin O\u2019Connor and Colorado Blue, with McEwen\u2019s Olympic team gold medal-winning colleague Oliver Townend third aboard Ballaghmor Class on 45.9.Canter, who won the world crown in North Carolina five years ago, can afford to have two fences down in Monday\u2019s showjumping finale and still land the \u00a3105,000 top prize.Thirty combinations completed the cross-country test, with almost half the field either being eliminated or deciding to retire.\u201cIt felt hard work in terms of galloping,\u201d 37-year-old Canter said. A horse like him should be celebrated \u2013 I have not sat on anything like him before  Ros Canter  \u201cHe had to dig deep, but he is so honest and is a fantastic jumper. He is economical with his jumping, and you can\u2019t get much better.\u201cA horse like him should be celebrated \u2013 I have not sat on anything like him before. Tomorrow is another day, but whatever happens, he is a star.\u201d",
        "O\u2019Connor rocketed 32 places up the leaderboard after dressage, adding just 10.8 penalties to his score in pursuit of a crown that has not been won by an Irish rider since Major Eddie Boylan in 1965.Cork-born O\u2019Connor, who is based in Oxfordshire, said: \u201cThe horse was amazing. He is the real deal.\u201cIt was the hardest he has had to try in a five-star event, but he is full of class. I\u2019ve got a great team at home and they have kept him very fit.\u201cHe is one of the best horses in the world, and I am a lot older than I look! I have ridden a lot of cross-country courses in the wet before.\u201dMcEwen, meanwhile, lies fifth on Toledo De Kerser, just behind world number one Tim Price, with Gemma Stevens in sixth and Canter holding seventh spot aboard her second ride Pencos Crown Jewel."
