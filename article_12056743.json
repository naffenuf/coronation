        "Edward and Sophie offer invaluable support to William and KateThe four Royals are linked by decades of hard work and duty\u00a0READ MORE: For all the latest Royal news, pictures and video click hereThere was a time when the so-called 'Fab Four' were said to be the future of a re-energised monarchy.",
        "Between them, William and Kate, Harry and new partner Meghan Markle, brought a touch of youth and glamour to a 'Firm' that might have seemed a little weary.That was until the spectacular falling out between the brothers culminating in Harry's departure to America with his family and his excoriating memoir, Spare.Yet today there is another royal 'Fab Four' supporting the Crown.",
        "It might seem rather low key than its media-friendly predecessor but has already proven to be invaluable in keeping the Royal Family afloat in stormy waters.\u00a0The alliance of William and Kate, Prince and Princess of Wales, and Edward and Sophie, Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh, has been largely under the radar.But to see them together on the front row at the Coronation was to realise what an influential foursome they have become.\u00a0And just\u00a0 two days later, the same quartet took the lead at a Buckingham Palace Garden Party, which praised volunteers up and down the country.\u00a0Kate and Sophie even matched their outfits that day in blue, long-hemmed dresses.\u00a0They each have a distinctive place.\u00a0As King Charles' younger brother by 16 years, Edward's role is an important bridge between the royal generations as the family embarks upon a new era.\u00a0William is heir to the throne. Catherine and Sophie have established key relationships that bind the royals together.",
        "\u00a0But what really links them all is years of hard work and duty.Edward's loyalty to the crown rewarded earlier this year when he was given the Duke of Edinburgh title.\u00a0Following the death of his father, Prince Philip in 2021, Edward took over many of his responsibilities, including heading The Duke of Edinburgh's Award.Now, along with his new title, he also represents a figure of\u00a0dependability for his nephew and future King, William, who no longer has his younger brother to lean on.With the experienced support of Edward and Sophie, William and Kate will see a smoother passage into their future destined duties as the future King and Queen.Since marrying into the royal family, Sophie, like Kate,\u00a0has long since cemented her place at the centre of the Monarchy - having been loved by both the late Queen and Prince Philip.\u00a0After losing her\u00a0 husband, the Queen and Sophie would walk their dogs together in the grounds of Windsor Castle. The Queen would often invited her to take Philip\u2019s place alongside her in the back of the car.Not only was Sophie a pillar of support to the Queen, but also Kate during the early stages of her relationship with William as she began her journey as a royal.\u00a0",
        "That bond was clear for all to see last week, when the Princess of Wales, 41, and the 58-year-old Duchess of Edinburgh were pictured together at the Buckingham Palace garden party thrown to celebrate the work of the nation\u2019s volunteers in the wake of the Coronation.Stepping out in carefully coordinating blue lace outfits, the smiling duo appeared relaxed and at ease as they mingled with guests \u2013 just as they had two days earlier when standing side by side in their ceremonial wear alongside the rest of the royal family on the palace balcony.On several occasions in recent years the couple have both mirrored not only each other\u2019s sartorial choices but also their body language at events raning from state occasions to more informal appearances at Wimbledon or Royal Ascot.\u00a0More than once, they have been captured in fits of laughter.Perhaps the friendship between the two women should not come as too much of a surprise: despite a seventeen-year-age gap the two have a great deal in common in terms of both background and outlook, sharing a pragmatic and stoic nature.",
        "Both come from loving and stable middle-class families. Sophie, the daughter of a sales director and secretary, was raised in a comfortable home in the picturesque village of Brenchley, Kent, while Kate enjoyed a happy and carefree childhood as the eldest of three in the Berkshire village of Bucklebury.",
        "Perhaps recognising the similarities between them \u2013 and understanding the adjustments required on entry into the British royal family \u2013 it was Sophie, then the Countess of Wessex, who took the then-newly-minted Duchess of Cambridge under her wing following her marriage to Prince William in 2011.Already an 11-year veteran of life at the heart of the monarchy following her marriage to Prince Edward in 1999, Sophie helped Kate in.\u00a0Over the years her wide counsel has blossomed into a close and lasting friendship \u2013 one that is proving to play a pivotal part in the future of the British monarchy."
