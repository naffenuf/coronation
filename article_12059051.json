        "It comes after\u00a0Chloe candidly discussed her postpartum journey on her Instagram.The fitness guru admitted she had no sex drive after giving birth and only regained her libido after she stopped breastfeeding and her cycle returned.Answering a fan who was concerned about their lack of sex drive after three months postpartum, Chloe reassured them that it was 'very common'.She said: 'If you're breastfeeding and or haven't started your menstrual cycle yet this is very common. It's down to low levels of oestrogen and also prolactin circulating the body.Revealing when her own sex drive returned, she said: 'I reduced BF and after a week or 2 knew my cycle was coming back because my libido reappeared.'",
        "Alongside the message, she shared a sweet snap of her breastfeeding her daughter.\u00a0It comes after Ann Widdecombe hit out at James\u00a0in March\u00a0after he revealed that his wife had to leave him a list detailing how to look after their daughter.Appearing on Jeremy Vine On 5, James revealed that he looked after Bodhi, then six months, alone for the first time over the weekend and shared how it went.He gushed that it was 'amazing' and said he had done a 'good job' but admitted that Chloe deserved some of the credit because she left him a parenting 'roadmap'.",
        "However, Ann, who was a panelist on the debate show, was left less than impressed as she slammed James for needing a 'list' to complete his parenting duties.James had explained that Chloe had given him a 'point-by-point list' detailing how to look after their baby.Speaking via video link, he said:\u00a0'I was left to look after Bodhi for the first time this weekend on my own. How was it? I'm still around, I haven't lost my mind. She was amazing.'But do you know why right? I'd like to say it's all because of me and my genius but my wife is so organised she wrote me a point-by-point list, a roadmap if you will, that I followed to the letter and absolutely smashed it.\u00a0",
        "'First night, bathed her, fed her, creamed her up, put her down. She had a meltdown around 45 minutes later, fed her, put her to bed, white noise on, and she was gone.''I've done such a good job, Chloe suggested I do it a bit more often,' James added, with a wide-eyed concerned look on his face.Returning to the studio, host Jeremy was seen laughing at his comments before asking Ann for her opinion.To which Ann fumed: 'I'm not at all impressed. If your wife had to make a list saying bath, feed, put to bed, cream. Uh honestly! Don't you know that by now?'\u00a0"
