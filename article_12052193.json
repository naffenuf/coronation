        "A total of 11 LIV Golf competitors filed suit in August of last year, including Phil Mickelson. Now just two players remain: Bryson DeChambeau and Matt Jones. LIV Golf itself has since added its name to the complaint.Mickelson removed his name for the lawsuit about a month after it was filed when LIV Golf joined as a plaintiff.\"The merits of the case -- the PGA Tour's anti-competitive conduct -- still stand and will be fully tested in court,\" LIV Golf spokesman Jonathan Grella said in a statement last year after Mickelson, Talor Gooch, Ian Poulter and Hudson Swafford removed their names.In February, the PGA Tour filed a countersuit against LIV Golf, saying the startup league induced players to break contracts with the PGA Tour.The original antitrust suit filed by nearly a dozen players was to combat the PGA Tour's decision to suspend golfers for competing on the opposing circuit without consent.--Field Level Media"
