        "A popular fitness influencer has been accused of trying to withhold customer receipts at her upcoming\u00a0warehouse sale.",
        "Ashy Bines,\u00a034, recently advertised a clearance sale on products from her loungewear and activewear brand Baseline, set to be held on May 6 and 7.A list of items was posted online alongside the notice: 'Visa, Mastercard, Debit, Apple Pay and cash accepted. No receipts, refunds or exchanges - all sales are final.'Instagram watchdog account influencertea_aus\u00a0posted a screenshot of this notice, and questioned the legality of selling clothes without providing receipts.In response to these questions, the price list was reuploaded to\u00a0Bines' Instagram Stories a few hours later with the added clarification:\u00a0'Receipts can be given via email. Just no paper ones.'",
        "It's lucky Bines clarified the issue of receipts with her followers because it is against the law for a business to deny a consumer proof of purchase.'Businesses must give consumers a receipt for anything that costs over $75,' states the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.'For anything under $75, the consumer can ask for a receipt, and the business must provide it within seven days.'",
        "Before Bines issued the clarification about receipts, there was a heated discussion in the comments section of\u00a0influencertea_aus about the legality of the clearance sale.Some speculated not offering proof of purchase was a way of avoiding providing refunds in the case of someone buying a defective product.",
        "But now Bines has stated email receipts will be provided, this is no longer an issue."
