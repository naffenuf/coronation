Movie is on track to cross the $1billion mark at the box office.\u00a0In an interview last month, Black admitted it was a 'no-brainer' when it came to taking on the role.\u00a0The star voices the fire-breathing antagonist in the new film adaptation of the hit Nintendo video game series and had no doubts about taking the role as there is an established audience for the movie.Jack told the BBC: 'My instinct was to say \"yes\" straight away, but then my agent says, 'Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a second. Let's negotiate with them.''But for me, it's one of those no-brainers.\u00a0'They want you to play Bowser in Super Mario Brothers?' That just sounds like a home run.

It will be interesting to see what happens to the entertainment industry over the next 20 to 30 years but I think we will be seeing more storytelling from the gaming universe.'Earlier in April, Black also\u00a0confirmed that he will reunite with his School Of Rock co-stars\u00a0in honor of the film's 20th anniversary, much to the delight of fans.\u00a0The beloved musical comedy was released on October 3, 2003 and featured a then 10-year-old Miranda Cosgrove before she became a Nickelodeon megastar, as well as Sarah Silverman, Joan Cusack and Mike White.\u00a0",
