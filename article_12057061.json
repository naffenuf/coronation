We just got an email asking me to do it!'He looked great in the white suit which he wore with a T-shirt underneath and shiny black shoes.\u00a0He completed his outfit with a huge white rose attached to the lapel of the jacket.\u00a0The King and Queen of the\u00a0royal family will join around 20,000 members of the public at the Coronation Concert to continue the celebrations after their crowning at Westminster Abbey on Saturday.The Coronation Concert will see performances by Paloma Faith, Katy Perry, Lionel Richie and veteran rock guitarist Steve Winwood.The show in Windsor, which will be hosted by Downton Abbey and Paddington star Hugh Bonneville, will start at 8pm on Sunday May 7.Buckingham Palace has promised 'global music icons and contemporary stars' for the big concert.It is certainly set to be the highlight of the second day of coronation celebrations with around 20,000 members of the public are expected to attend.",
