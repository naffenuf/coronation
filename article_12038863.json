        "ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) - After not selecting a defensive tackle in the NFL draft last weekend, the Buffalo Bills landed one in free agency by signing Kaylon \"Poona\" Ford to a one-year contract on Tuesday.",
        "Listed at 5-foot-11 and 310 pounds, Ford joins the Bills after spending five seasons in Seattle, including the past four as a starter. Ford was regarded as one of the top defensive linemen available in free agency and fills an immediate depth need along Buffalo\u00b4s front.The signing comes after general manager Brandon Beane on Saturday lamented not having a chance to use one of his six draft picks on a defensive tackle. Beane then said he anticipated using what limited space he had under the salary cap to address the position.The 27-year-old Ford broke into the league as an undrafted free agent out of Texas. Ford has proven dependable in stopping the run and also penetrating the line of scrimmage in getting 7 1/2 career sacks, including three last season.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL"
