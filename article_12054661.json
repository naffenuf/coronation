        "Prince George\u2019s first solo role at a major ceremony saw him star at his grandfather\u2019s coronation as one of the King\u2019s Pages of Honour.",
        "The nine-year-old, who is second in line to the throne after his father, the Prince of Wales, rose to the occasion on Saturday as Charles and the Queen were crowned at Westminster Abbey in central London.The schoolboy future king was immediately visible during the televised ceremony as he carried a corner of the long train of his grandfather\u2019s regal robes as Charles entered the abbey.",
        "Later, George and the other pages were seen sitting behind Charles at the front of the Gothic church as the King swore the coronation Oath.George\u2019s gaze could be seen flitting about the church from his seat behind his grandfather.The prince and his fellow pages then stood behind the kneeling Charles, again holding the corners of his train, as he prayed.",
        "It marked a step up for George, as he took on the important role independently from his parents William and the Princess of Wales.His younger siblings \u2013 Princess Charlotte, eight, and Prince Louis, five, \u2013 were wedged between William and Kate in the front row during the ceremony.George and his siblings will, eventually, be expected to carry out an array of official engagements as adult working members of the royal family.",
        "After leaving the abbey, George joined his immediate family in a carriage ride back to Buckingham Palace, riding behind Charles and Camilla\u2019s Gold State Coach.",
        "George was seen smiling and peering curiously out of the window during the journey to get a better view of the procession and crowds along the route.Later on the Buckingham Palace balcony, a grinning George gazed up as the Red Arrows soared overhead during a military flypast that was scaled down due to the rainy, cloudy weather.",
        "And a father who watched the ceremony in Rochester, Kent, said his children \u201cloved\u201d seeing George play a key role.Screens had been mounted outside Rochester Castle, where families were encouraged to bring their picnics and watch the coronation service.Max Harrison, 29, who went to watch it with his children and said: \u201cThey loved seeing Prince George carrying the King\u2019s robe, he\u2019s just about my son\u2019s age so they get excited to see him.\u201d"
