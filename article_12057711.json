Our task is to prevent this.\"The battle for the city, once home to 70,000 people, has symbolic importance for both sides, with Ukraine still holding on to some parts of after more than 10 months of fierce fighting against regular Russian troops and the Wagner mercenary force.Moscow sees Bakhmut as a stepping stone to attacking other Ukrainian cities.
