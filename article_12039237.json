        "Aubameyang was starting his first game for Chelsea since the turn of the yearThe Blues conceded three goals inside the first 35 minutes of the gameHe has scored just three times in 21 appearances since signing for Chelsea\u00a0Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang endured another tough evening for Chelsea against former side Arsenal on Tuesday evening.",
        "The forward touched the ball just nine times before being taken off at half time as his torrid time back in London continued at his former stomping ground.Four of those touches were from kick-off as the Blues succumbed to a 3-0 deficit at half time.Frank Lampard before the game had hinted the forward had the attributes that he needed from his forward players for the run in as he was given a start over Joao Felix.But the 33-year-old was unable to have the impact desired before being hooked at the break.",
        "The game was Aubameyang's first start for Chelsea in 2023, and it showed as he struggled to provide any sort of threat going forward.He was booed when he did touch the ball during the game after leaving Arsenal on bad terms in 2022.He moved to Barcelona and enjoyed moderate success, but his \u00a312million move to Chelsea this season has seen him deliver just three goals in 21 games.",
        "As an Arsenal player he was dropped for a disciplinary breach before being stripped of the captaincy by Mikel Arteta in 2021, before eventually departing.Several reports suggested he was involved in a bust-up with the Spaniard before he left.Chelsea, meanwhile, have now lost all six games under Frank Lampard since he re-joined the club as interim manager last month with the game finishing 3-1.",
        "They are 12th in the Premier League, nine points clear of the relegation spots with four games left to play."
