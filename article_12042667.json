        "Humza Yousaf has said he hopes a compromise can be found which will allow SNP MP Joanna Cherry\u2019s Edinburgh Fringe show to go ahead.",
        "An event due to be held at the Stand comedy club in which Ms Cherry was to be interviewed as part of a series has been cancelled.The club\u00a0said\u00a0\u201ckey operational staff\u201d had raised concerns about\u00a0the MP\u2019s views\u00a0and made clear they did not want\u00a0to\u00a0work at the event.Ms Cherry has been a vocal critic of the Scottish Government\u2019s gender recognition reforms, an issue which has put her at odds with the party\u2019s leadership.She claims many colleagues agree with her but are \u201cafraid to speak out\u201d.The Edinburgh South West MP, who is also a KC, indicated she is keeping her options open around taking legal action over the cancellation of the show.",
        "Mr Yousaf said on Wednesday that he has not spoken to the MP about the situation.He said: \u201cI really do hope that Joanna\u2019s show can go ahead.\u201cI hope there\u2019s a way there can be a compromise found in terms of Joanna\u2019s show going ahead.\u201cJoanna and I have a difference on a number of issues, including for example the GRR Bill that was passed by the Scottish Parliament.\u201cI do think it\u2019s important that those views are heard.\u201dHe said it is not the First Minister\u2019s role to \u201ctell comedy clubs and other venues what shows they must and must not put on\u201d.",
        "In\u00a0a\u00a0statement\u00a0on\u00a0Monday, the club\u00a0said: \u201cFurther\u00a0to\u00a0our previous policy statement\u00a0on\u00a0this matter, following extensive discussions\u00a0with\u00a0our staff it\u00a0has\u00a0become clear that\u00a0a\u00a0number of the Stand\u2019s key operational staff, including venue management and box office personnel, are unwilling\u00a0to\u00a0work\u00a0on\u00a0this event.\u201cAs we have previously stated, we will ensure that their\u00a0views\u00a0are respected.\u201cWe will not compel our staff\u00a0to\u00a0work\u00a0on\u00a0this event and so have concluded that the event is unable\u00a0to\u00a0proceed\u00a0on\u00a0a\u00a0properly staffed, safe and legally compliant basis.\u201d"
