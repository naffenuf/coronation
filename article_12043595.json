        "West Ham are currently drawing 0-0 with Manchester City at the EtihadThey're squad was drastically reduced by a sickness big among playersKey players Declan Rice, Tomas Soucek and Nayef Aguerd are all missing\u00a0West Ham's squad has been ravaged by a sickness bug that has left them with just five outfield subs for their clash with Man City on Wednesday night.",
        "Key players Tomas Soucek, Declan Rice\u00a0\u00a0and\u00a0Nayef Aguerd are among those missing, with the likes of\u00a0Flynn Downes coming into the side and Aaron Cresswell taking the captaincy.Rice had played every Premier League minute before Wednesday, but was sent back to London due to his illness.\u00a0They have named just seven of a possible nine subs, with two spots taken up by goalkeepers\u00a0Alphonse Areola and Joseph Anang.\u00a0The bug could not have come at worse time, with the Hammers not yet safe from relegation after back-to-back losses.",
        "They face a City side who can go top with a win, although Pep Guardiola has also made changes.Kevin de Bruyne misses the game through injury, while Ilkay Gundogan and Ederson have been rested.Moyes admitted his selection plans had been affected by the bug, as he told Sky Sports:\u00a0We picked our team last night, Some of them are too ill so we\u2019ve had to change the team.'Hopefully it's not too bad. We had named some of the players who are not here in the side, but two or three of them are ill and there's nothing we can do about it.\u00a0It will give some other players opportunities.\u00a0",
        "'It was always a tough game, we\u2019ve come here a couple of times and got something. We\u2019ll make it difficult. We want a good performance here tonight, but if we don\u2019t get that and we win we\u2019ll take that.\u00a0",
        "On City's in-form striker Erling Haaland, he added:\u00a0'They\u2019ve got a super centre forward and other good players as well, we have to hope he's not having a good night.\u00a0'There are some great premier league centre halves over the year who would have loved the challenge of Haaland, we have to hope they\u2019re up for it tonight.'Despite their list of absentees, West Ham are currently holding their own at the Etihad, where the game remains goalless.\u00a0"
