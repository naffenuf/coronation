        "The former fish and chip shop manager, 49, shared an Instagram post on Wednesday begging supermarkets to lower the cost of their products.Bird, a mother of two teenage children, admitted she's 'not built' for a career on the adult website, which many Aussies are now using to supplement their income.Despite taking home $250,000 in prize money during the 2003 and 2022 seasons of Big Brother, the TV personality has struggled financially over the years.She is also legally blind after being diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa, a rare degenerative eye disease that causes severe vision impairment.",
