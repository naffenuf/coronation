        "Carol Vorderman left viewers in hysterics on Tuesday night's episode of I'm A Celebrity South Africa as she claimed she has 'Britain's most buoyant bottom'.\u00a0",
        "The former Countdown star, 62, was taking part in a terrifying underwater challenge 'Tanks of Torment' that saw her swim through sea creatures to gain stars and meals for the camp.\u00a0She was joined by Olympic athlete Fatima Whitbread, also 62, who showed off her almighty strength by using a lever to raise up trapdoors for Carol to swim through.\u00a0Before starting the challenge, Carol confessed that an unusual problem could likely impair her in the task.\u00a0She told a very amused Ant and Dec: 'The only problem I really have is, right, my bottom always floats to the top.\u00a0",
        "'It's the most buoyant thing in Britain!'Viewers couldn't contain their laughter at Carol's very naughty confession as they rushed to Twitter.\u00a0One joked: 'Never need armbands with Carol around!', while another simply exclaimed: 'HAHA Carol.'\u00a0As Carol unscrewed the stars and added them to her bag, Dec couldn't resist making another reference to her famous behind.\u00a0\u00a0The cheeky presenter added: 'That's the problem with having Britain's most buoyant bottom. It's difficult to get down!', while Ant said: 'Very difficult!'But although she managed to win seven meals for camp, ultimately Carol wasn't able to complete the challenge.\u00a0\u00a0She appeared shaky from early on as she swam among the alligators, admitting: 'I'm really not happy about this.'",
        "Seeing a terrifying snake was the final straw for the TV personality as it forced her to quit the challenge altogether, despite Fatima's words of encouragement.\u00a0",
        "A devastated Carol said:\u00a0'I can't do that. I'm not sure I want to do it. I've got this fear of drowning.'I have this real fear of drowning. And it's like my ultimate fear.'It comes after\u00a0Amir Khan became the third person to be evicted from the I'm A Celeb South Africa jungle on Tuesday following a secret ballot from his campmates.In Monday's episode, the campmates learned that, in a dramatic first for the series, they'd be choosing who was voted out of camp next.And it was the former boxer, 36, who ended up losing his place in the camp after getting the most votes from his campmates.Speaking to hosts Ant and Dec after he left the camp, Amir told how he was proud of himself after overcoming his fears, noting how he'd handled a snake in his last trial.\u00a0He also gushed over his second stint on the ITV show, remarking that it was one of the 'best experiences I've ever had',\u00a0 adding that it was 'even better than Australia'.The sportsman's vote was no doubt influenced by the fact he'd earlier declared that he was ready to leave as he was missing his children.",
        "After the vote was revealed, Georgia Toffolo said that she felt so 'distraught' that her buddy had left.\u00a0While Janice Dickenson called him a 'good egg', with Paul Burrell adding he was a 'trooper'.\u00a0After each voting in a secret ballot, the campmates woke up unhappy about the prospect of having a hand in who is leaving that morning.Helen Flanagan said of voting: 'It makes you feel like s***', while Georgia Toffolo adds:\u00a0'I'm not happy about my decision. I just felt I had to vote for someone.'Myleene Klass said: 'I'm now thinking, did I do the right thing?'Amir noted: 'This is not a holiday, it's a competition and there has to be one Legend, one winner.'While Jordan Banjo concurred: 'At the end of the day there's only going to be one winner.'Amir's exit comes after\u00a0Shaun Ryder and Gillian McKeith\u00a0became the first stars to leave the camp."
