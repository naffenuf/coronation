        "John Ryder takes on pound-for-pound star Canelo Alvarez in Mexico on SaturdayThe Brit, 34, is looking to become the undisputed super-middleweight championSign up here to watch the fight exclusively on DAZN\u00a0Some 16 years ago, John Ryder made a promise to his partner, Nancy, one he vows to finally honour on Saturday night in\u00a0Guadalajara, Mexico. That promise? To become a world champion boxer.\u00a0\u00a0",
        "'I told her I was going to be world champion,' he told Mail Sport. 'Two kids later \u2013 we\u2019re not married yet, that will come \u2013 I still need to achieve that dream...\u00a0She\u2019s stuck with me so far, so she needs to see I wasn\u2019t full of s**t!'\u00a0On Saturday - or the early hours of Sunday morning, depending on where you're watching from - we'll find out exactly what Ryder is made of, in what representes one of the toughest challenges in boxing: fighting Canelo Alvarez in Mexico on Cinco de Mayo weekend.\u00a0Indeed, the Echo Arena in Liverpool can be an unforgiving battlefield, as Ryder found out when he was\u00a0controversially beaten by Callum Smith in his sole world title bid to date. But the circa 50,000 fans set to cram inside the Estadio Akron as Canelo entertains a Mexican crowd for the first time in almost 12 years will create an entirely different atmosphere.\u00a0Likewise, the prize on offer is worlds apart. Not a world title, but four. And not a win over a domestic rival, but a genuinely legacy-defining, all-time great British win on away soil. Pressure... or so you'd think.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",
        "'All the pressure is on Canelo,' Ryder, who has a record of 32 wins and five defeats, continued. 'There\u2019s no pressure on me. It\u2019s his first time back home in 12 years. I feel like I\u2019m coming off a career-best year, while he\u2019s potentially coming off a career-worst.\u00a0",
        "'I know it\u2019s against a different level of opposition, but he lost to Dmitry Bivol and then gave a lacklustre performance against Gennnady Golovkin. He didn\u2019t look as he should have done.\u00a0'A lot of people were expecting him to get Golovkin out of there, but he couldn\u2019t. He\u2019s had surgery on his wrist after that, so we\u2019ll just have to see what he\u2019s got left.'It's true: Canelo was undoubtedly the face of boxing in November 2021 when he beat Caleb Plant to become undisputed super-middlweight champion - a title he still holds.\u00a0Having reigned as the unified middleweight champion, and after a brief jump to light-heavyweight where he dethroned Sergey Kovalev, Canelo embarked on a year-long mission, defeating titleholders Callum Smith, Billy Joe Saunders and finally Plant to become the first-ever undisputed champion at 168lbs. History.\u00a0But less than two years later, his reputation has been hit somewhat. Losing emphatically to Dmitry Bivol back up at light-heavyweight was not part of the plan. And, in truth, a points win over a 40-year-old Gennady Golovkin wasn't quite the statement he wanted to make. Oleksandr Usyk, Noaya Inoue and Terence Crawford now arguably sit higher in the pound-for-pound standings.\u00a0At the same time, Ryder has continued to put together a stunning run of wins, claiming victories over Daniel Jacobs and Zach Parker and making plenty of noise while doing so.\u00a0As mandatory challenger Ryder says: 'I deserve to be in this position and I\u2019ve earned my shot over and over and over. I\u2019m going to take what\u2019s rightfully mine.'",
        "But this isn't Ryder looking to strike while the iron's hot. The 34-year-old has wanted a fight with Canelo for years - and he still wants to face the best version of Canelo. 'If Canelo knocked out Bivol and then Golovkin, I\u2019d still want this fight,' he said.\u00a0",
        "'Whether people are thinking he\u2019s on the decline or not, I want the biggest and best fights.\u00a0I think we all expected Canelo to go in there and blast Golovkin out.\u00a0'We know Golovkin's getting on a bit now. He\u2019s been a formidable force for years, and he\u2019s still got that concussive punch power, but I think we all expected Canelo to put on a real show and put that one to bed. We didn\u2019t get that, and then obviously it came out about the surgery on his wrist.\u00a0'I\u2019m hoping that he\u2019s had the surgery and he\u2019s back to his best, because I want to fight the best version of Canelo. I\u2019m going to be the best version of myself on May 6, so I hope he is. I want to beat Canelo at his best.'As the fight's strapline 'the King is coming home' alludes to, Canelo's return to Mexico is a big deal for his country. Their press conference on Wednesday was as much a celebration of the Mexican as an opportunity for the two fighters to come face-to-face.\u00a0",
        "Ryder was met with polite applause, Canelo a hero's welcome. The crowd won't be so friendly towards the challenger on Saturday night, though, but the Brit assures they won't be able to help Canelo in the ring.'It\u2019s going to be huge,' Ryder explained. 'It will be intimidating at times, but I\u2019ve just got to block that out, channel my energy into that ring. It\u2019s just me and him in there.'They can be as loud as they want out in the stands, but ultimately it\u2019s me and him hitting each other. They can\u2019t help him that much.'",
        "If Ryder is to be successful, the immediate question is: what's next? The 34-year-old insists fame and fortune has not crossed his mind - but, as an Arsenal fan, he already knows where he wants the rematch.\u00a0\u00a0'For me now, it\u2019s fight by fight,' Ryder said. 'Beat Canelo, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get the rematch at the Emirates or Las Vegas and we\u2019ll go from there.'I want to hold on to these titles for a while, and that starts on May 6.'Obviously Cassius Clay (Muhammad Ali) fought Henry Cooper at the old Arsenal stadium, so for me to be the first headline event at the new stadium would be a dream come true for sure.'",
