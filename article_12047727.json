        "Boston Celtics guard Marcus Smart won the 2022-23 NBA Hustle Award, the league announced Thursday.",
        "It is the second straight year and the third time in five seasons that Smart, 29, has received the annual honor.The so-called hustle stats -- deflections, loose balls recovered, charges drawn, screen assists, contested shots and box-outs -- have been tracked by the NBA since 2016. The award was first presented in 2016-17.Smart, the 2021-22 NBA Defensive Player of the Year, averaged 11.5 points, 6.3 assists, 3.1 rebounds and 1.5 steals in 61 games (all starts) in 2022-23.\"His energy plays, the sacrifices he makes for his teammates, the all-out effort in which he competes may not appear in the traditional box score,\" read the NBA news release. \"But those plays were key to Boston finishing with the second-best record in the NBA (57-25) and helped Smart earn his third career NBA Hustle Award.\"Golden State Warriors forward Draymond Green finished second in the voting and Indiana Pacers swingman Aaron Nesmith was third.--Field Level Media"
