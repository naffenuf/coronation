        "\u00a0De Zerbi is a doubt to be in the dugout to face Manchester United due to illness\u00a0His assistant will take training after De Zerbi cancelled his press conferenceBrighton &amp; Hove Albion boss Roberto De Zerbi is a doubt to be on the touchline when his side face Manchester United on Thursday.",
        "The Italian cancelled his press conference on Wednesday as he is unwell and remains at home recovering from his illness.It remains unclear as to whether he will feel better by the time of the clash against United at the Amex tomorrow night.His assistant and housemate Andrea Maldera is taking training in his absence and will be on the touchline tomorrow if De Zerbi is unavailable.Brighton have been without De Zerbi several times this season, with the Italian receiving touchline bans twice already this season.",
        "In his absence previously, Brighton won both fixtures without conceding. Their first, a 4-0 win over West Ham before beating Grimby 5-0 in the FA Cup.The Italian will have full faith in his assistant, who he previously described as 'like a family' to him as they spend each day together, both working and living together.\u00a0A win over the Red Devils would see De Zerbi's Brighton into sixth in the Premier League as they continue their search for European football next season.The fixture is a replay of this season's FA Cup semi-final, where the Seagulls crashed out on penalties as Man United progressed to set up a Manchester derby in the final.While Brighton will no doubt be out for revenge, the tough will no doubt be made tougher by the absence of their head coach.",
        "De Zerbi will be hoping for a swift return to the dugout to build on Brighton's good form as they beat Wolves 6-0 last time out.\u00a0"
