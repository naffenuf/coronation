        "Cambridge beat Forest Green 2-0 on the final day of the League One season to complete a remarkable escape from relegation.",
        "The U\u2019s were seven points from safety going into the final nine games of the campaign but their win over Rovers, coupled with MK Dons and Morecambe dropping points, means Mark Bonner\u2019s side stay up.They had fallen into the drop zone on January 14 and climbed out of it only on the final day thanks to goals from Harrison Dunk and Sam Smith.Both goals came in the first half, with Cambridge taking the lead after 25 minutes when Conor McGrandles\u2019 corner was scrambled home by Dunk, and it was 2-0 eight minutes before half-time.Jack Lankester helped the ball on to Smith, who fired a superb volley in off the far post.Rock-bottom Forest Green did threaten, with Dominic Bernard heading against the bar from close range, and Lankester almost headed a corner into his own net soon after the break.",
        "The remainder of the game petered out into a non-event, with attentions turned to the outcome of scores elsewhere as Cambridge secured a third season in the third tier."
