If you can hear me, raise your hand if you want her removed from the flight. I'm not even kidding, I got 40 hands up.'The footage then showed multiple passengers with their hands up before the self-appointed leader of the pack called for a security guard to come over.",

Because where is the police?' inquired one flyer."
