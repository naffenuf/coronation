        "West Coast's horror run with injuries has continued with young midfielder Jai Culley substituted out of the clash with Richmond because of a knee issue.",
        "The Eagles kicked the opening two goals at the MCG on Saturday and led by 13 points when Culley was hurt 12 minutes into the first quarter.The 20-year-old injured his right knee in a marking contest with Tigers defender Nathan Broad and slumped to the turf.Culley stayed down for several minutes before hobbling off the field with the assistance of trainers as play was held up by the umpires.Eagles substitute Zane Trew immediately started warming up on the boundary line and was called into the game before quarter-time.Culley has played nine senior games since joining West Coast during last year's mid-season rookie draft.The last-placed Eagles are already operating without a long list of injured players, including stars such as Nic Naitanui, Luke Shuey, Elliot Yeo, Jamie Cripps, Jeremy McGovern and Liam Ryan."
