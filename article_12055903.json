        "A tip-off from interstate police has led investigators in the Northern Territory to a buried drug haul in Darwin.",
        "NT police said on Sunday they were tipped off late last month by officers in NSW over the movements of a 41-year-old Darwin man.Police said they began monitoring the man's activities and later watched him bury an empty drum in bush not far from the Esplanade on Wednesday.Police said the man returned to the drum shortly after its burial, stashing 3kg of cocaine and $110,000 in cash.Detectives retrieved the barrel and its contents and arrested the man the next morning.Officers then executed a search warrant at a rural property in Howard Springs, 29km southeast of Darwin, where they found 6kg of cannabis and a commercial quantity of a schedule-one drug.Another $100,000 in cash was seized at the Howard Springs site, where a 42 year-old man was arrested.He has since been charged with supplying a schedule-one dangerous drug, supplying a commercial quantity of a dangerous drug and dealing with the proceeds of crime.The 41-year-old man was also charged with dealing with the proceeds of crime, as well as the supply of a commercial quantity of a schedule-one drug.Both men are in custody and will appear at Darwin Local Court on Monday.Detective Superintendent Lee Morgan said the bust should serve as a warning to the members of criminal networks that the police could be watching them at any time.",
        "\"Northern Territory Police continue to work closely with all our partner states and Commonwealth agencies. These arrests were achieved by police forces working together to achieve a common goal,\" he said."
