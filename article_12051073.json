        "\u201cJoe\u2019s focus is to make sure we are as embedded into this sport as much as possible and it is current, and for me it is to make sure that it is authentic, and that it is believable and also to provide a view of racing from a different perspective than you might see on TV.",
        "\u201cI am spending a lot of time right now helping Joe and the team get the script right, and that is an amazing process and something I am really enjoying.\u201d"
