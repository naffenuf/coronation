        "Acuna left three pitches into the second game of Monday's doubleheader not long after a 93-mph fastball from Mets starter Tylor Megill ran way up and way in. Acuna hit the dirt after being hit by the 0-2 pitch and was immediately replaced in the lineup by Kevin Pillar.Braves manager Brian Snitker said the team sent Acuna to a nearby hospital for additional tests after stadium X-rays showed no bone damage.\"You just want to make sure,\" Snitker said.In 67 career games against the Mets, Acuna has 81 hits, 14 home runs, 41 RBIs and a .309 batting average. He's been hit by a pitch four times in 297 plate appearances.Braves pitchers plunked the Mets three times in the opener, a 9-8 win by the Braves. Acuna went 3-for-5 in Game 1, including a 448-foot monster shot that landed in the third seating deck in left-center field.Acuna, 25, is batting .363 with five home runs and 26 runs so far this season.--Field Level Media"
