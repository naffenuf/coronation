Neighbours said the victim lived with her parents, brother and sister and worked from home.\u00a0Jacqueline Demontague said she saw the woman\u2019s distraught father rushing to the scene shortly after 4pm following a phone call from the grandmother.",
        "She said: \u2018She was on the phone to her grandmother and suddenly she began shouting and screaming.\u00a0'I cannot imagine how awful it must have been for both her and her grandmother. The grandmother phoned the woman\u2019s father, who came straight out to the scene.\u2018He was in a state of shock, of course. He couldn\u2019t believe what had happened. Lots of other family members came out too \u2013 they were beside themselves.\u2018It had been her mother\u2019s birthday and she went out to pick up some birthday things and was on her way back from the shop when she was attacked from behind.\u2019Ms Demontague said a witness claimed the knifeman was all in black.",
        "\u2018I\u2019m not sure what it was for, for a mobile phone, a mugging or what. But what a tragedy, a waste of a young life,\u2019 she added.Another neighbour said residents had been desperately calling for more police because of anti-social behaviour and drug use. Despite Brixton police station being close by, he said there were few patrols.",
        "\u2018In one residents\u2019 meeting with police someone stood up and said it would take a violent rape or murder to happen before they did something,\u2019 he added.\u2018And look where we are now. A young girl has lost her life in broad daylight.\u2019Scotland Yard confirmed the victim died at 4.42pm on Monday.Detective Chief Superintendent Seb Adjei-Addoh, policing commander for Lambeth, said: \u2018This is a shocking attack and my thoughts are with the woman\u2019s family and friends.\u2019The latest tragedy has triggered fresh calls for police to ramp up efforts to do more to protect women from violence in the capital.\u00a0Florence Eshalomi, Labour MP for Vauxhall, branded the killing a 'senseless' act of violence but urged people not to become 'desensitised to violence against women and girls'.\u00a0'It is a big issue and I think one of the things we need to look at is the vicious nature and randomness of this attack,' she told ITV.\u00a0",
        "'But equally, we do know that there is a history with knife attacks - especially knife attacks when fatal.'One of the things we need to do is make sure we have got good, local police who are visible, working with the community and that's something we are trying to do locally here.'\u00a0"
