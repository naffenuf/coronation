        "Gold Coast veteran Kieran Foran has been cleared to line up against Parramatta in Magic Round despite suffering hand, knee and toe injuries in last week's upset defeat of Manly.",
        "The 32-year-old required six stitches in his finger, a pain-killing needle in his toe and strapping on his knee to make it through the 26-10 win over his old side but was named in the team list on Tuesday afternoon.Foran was still a chance of dropping out of the squad pending the results of scans, but on Wednesday morning, was cleared of serious injury.He needs only to pass a fitness test on Friday to line up against the Eels, another of his former clubs.Foran's speedy recovery comes after he spent only two weeks out with a calf injury earlier this season.That Foran's body is holding up so well comes as a welcome surprise given his extensive injury history; between 2015 and 2020, Foran did not play more than 20 games in any season.His availability is a huge boon for the Titans given fellow playmaker AJ Brimson's recent hamstring injury.Brimson left the field in the 41st minute against the Sea Eagles and the Titans confirmed on Wednesday morning he had suffered a grade-two left hamstring tear that would rule him out for between four and six weeks.The injury pushes Jayden Campbell from the bench to the starting side to face Parramatta."
