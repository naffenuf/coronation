So my job became the sweat collector.'Joan collected Rodney's sweat through the trusty method of sponge and a spoon. 'I'd collect his sweat - about an inch at a time,' she explains. 'I thought we could water it down but he said, 'No, that wouldn't be right.''Born Jacob Rodney Cohen in New York 1921, Rodney became a surprise hit of The Ed Sullivan Show in the 1960s and went on to appear in films Caddyshack and Easy Money in the 1980s.
