        "An 89-year-old St John Ambulance volunteer who was on duty for the late Queen\u2019s coronation said he remembers her crowning ceremony as \u201cjoyful\u201d as he predicts she will be a \u201chard act to follow\u201d for Charles.",
        "Derek Williams has met Elizabeth several times over the past 70 years through his volunteering work and being made an MBE, as well as attending garden parties at Buckingham Palace with the service.In 1952 he joined the St John Ambulance service, aged just 18, when he was invited by a friend, and for the Queen\u2019s big day in 1953 he was stationed near Selfridges on Oxford Street.Mr Williams, who will be watching Charles\u2019 coronation from home in Betchworth, Surrey, said: \u201cIt was an honour to be part of the coronation and to provide service to the public.\u201cPeople were very, very joyful. Some had camped overnight, as they are doing now, there was no animosity or anything like that. They were joyful, friendly, and pleased to be there, I think.\u201dOn his meetings with Elizabeth over the years, Mr Williams said: \u201cAt the garden parties, before the general public was let in, the Queen would come out to thank everybody.\u201cShe thanked the catering staff, and other people involved.\u201cObviously she had the Master of the House with her and several of her corgis.\u201cI don\u2019t think I would have touched them though!\u201d",
        "He added: \u201cShe was a very friendly lady. There\u2019s no barriers between her. She always asked how people are.",
        "\u201cYou don\u2019t ask questions to her, but she was always interested in people, interested in what people do.\u201dFor his volunteering work Mr Williams was made an MBE in 1993, and was given the honour by the Queen.He said: \u201cWhen she presented me with my MBE she asked where I do my volunteering, and I told her London, she remarked, \u2018a very busy place\u2019.\u201cI said, Yes Ma\u2019am!\u2019\u201d",
        "On how Charles will fare as King, Mr Williams said: \u201cI think Charles will be a good king.\u201cI think he has got some waves to surf over before, to try to smooth his reign, but I think he will be a good king.\u201cMainly because of his upbringing, he has learned to intermix with people, he is not frightened to ask questions.\u201cHe has a background of going to various schools, a military background.\u201cI think he has been shaped for the role with the help of his mother.\u201cI think she will be a very hard act to follow.\u201cIf I could say anything to the King, I would thank him for everything he\u2019s done for our country so far and wish him all the best for a long and prosperous reign.\u201d"
