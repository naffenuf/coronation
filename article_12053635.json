        "Republican protesters appear to have been arrested ahead of the King\u2019s coronation.",
        "Footage on Twitter seemed to show Graham Smith, chief executive of the anti-monarchy group Republic, being apprehended by police in St Martin\u2019s Lane, near Trafalgar Square, on Saturday morning.Pictures appeared to show demonstrators in yellow \u201cNot My King\u201d T-shirts, including Mr Smith, having their details taken by officers.In one video, an officer says: \u201cI\u2019m not going to get into a conversation about that \u2013 they are under arrest, end of.\u201dOn Wednesday, the Metropolitan Police announced they would have an \u201cextremely low threshold\u201d for protests during the coronation celebrations, and that demonstrators could expect \u201cswift action\u201d.After the apparent arrests, Republic activist Luke Whiting, 26, told the PA news agency: \u201cSix Republic members have been arrested including the CEO as the demonstration was starting at the edge of Trafalgar Square.\u201cIt is unclear why, potentially it is because one of them was carrying a megaphone.\u201cIt is unclear exactly whether the police are using these new powers and whether they are misusing them to stop protest happening.\u201d",
        "One woman in a Republic T-shirt who was arrested told PA: \u201cWe had a delivery of placards ready for the protest and then the tactical support unit questioned us as to how we we had got through the road closures.\u201cThey questioned whether what we were doing was a delivery.",
        "\u201cThey then said they found evidence of means of locking on, of items that could be used to lock on, and they arrested us.\u201dOfficers carried her away from where she had been standing outside a Tesco store.Two men who appeared to have been part of the same demonstration were carried away by officers into a marked police van.The policing operation is set to see 11,500 police officers on duty on Saturday."
