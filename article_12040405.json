        "Adama Traore credits Marko Rudan's ability to build trust with his players as the key reason for Western Sydney's revival, claiming the outside world doesn't see the real side to the Wanderers boss.",
        "Rudan's first off-season in charge of the Wanderers was marked by an exodus from the club as he brought a host of fresh faces to Sydney's west in a bid to rejuvenate the A-League's sleeping giant.Traore was one of the few players retained from Carl Robinson's disastrous tenure and only a suspension has prevented him from featuring in every Wanderers game this season.The veteran defender says the trust between the manager and his players has helped the Wanderers secure a first finals berth in six years.Traore said that process began when Rudan visited his family home for dinner over the off-season, leading to what the Ivorian leftback describes as his finest year in Australia.\"I always say you don't judge somebody on what you see, you have to meet the guy and talk to him,\" Traore told AAP.\"Family is very important to him and that's the biggest thing, he wants to make sure your family is happy.\"Outside of football, he's willing to help anybody no matter what your problem is.\"The trust (that creates) is very important and we have to pay him back by performing on the pitch.\"The Wanderers finished fourth in the regular season to set up Saturday's elimination final against Sydney FC.",
        "If there is one criticism of Rudan's reborn Wanderers, it's that they have struggled to back up their best performances.But Traore is aware that now the finals are here there aren't going to be any second chances.\"We are happy to reach finals but we don't want to stop, we want to go further,\" Traore said.\"The past is the past, nobody cares about what you did yesterday.\"The present and the future is the most important thing.\""
