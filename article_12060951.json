        "FBI agent Doug Hart testified that in early October 2019, the pair were secretly planning on going on a date when Daybell texted Vallow 'big news' that his then-wife Tammy Daybell had 'switched' and that a demonic entity had entered her body.Weeks later, on October 19, Tammy suddenly died in her sleep.\u00a0Her cause of death was determined to be asphyxiation and not a heart attack, as previously believed.Roughly 24 hours after her death, Vallow and Daybell texted about missing each other, as he told her, 'it is baby night so come get me later.'Hart, who has been on the stand in Vallow's trial testifying about what was uncovered in her seized iCloud account, said that 'their\u00a0relationship is the driving force behind the crimes that are alleged in this case.'",
        "Vallow, 49, and Daybell, 54, are accused of murdering her kids JJ, 7, and Tylee, 16, in September 2019. The following month they allegedly killed his wife Tammy. The pair married two weeks later on the beach in Hawaii.Vallow is accused of conspiring to murder Tammy Daybell and has pleaded not guilty to that charge.On October 3, 2019, before Tammy's death, Daybell texted Vallow gushing how excited he was to go on a date with her. The next day, texts revealed she had told her brother Alex Cox about going on the date.",
        "'We are supposed to go on a real date tonight, but we are discussing it,' she wrote. 'So excited to go on a real date tonight we are discussing it. Perhaps an evening at home would be better so we're not out and about.'But Daybell then texted Vallow with 'big news' about his wife Tammy.\u00a0'Hello sweet angel. Big news about tammy. Please let me know if you're awake'He went on to write: 'Tammy has been switched. Tammy is in Limbo, and a level 3 demonic entity named Viola is in her body.''Not fully sure of the timing for removal, but once her actions verify the differences, I don't want to wait.'\u00a0In the 24 hours after Tammy died, Daybell and Vallow already texting, telling each other how much they miss them, and talk about spending their lives together.\u00a0'I'm feeling sad, but it isn't for the reason everyone thinks,' Daybell wrote the morning after his wife's death.\u00a0Daybell sent Vallow a text about the death percentages, Hart revealed on the stand, then went off on how much he missed her.\u00a0'Percentage in body - Holsor 24, Ukola 11, Grisome 14. Great job on lowering them,' he texted Vallow.Earlier texts had revealed how the pair created a twisted percentage scale to show how close her kids - and others - were to death.\u00a0",
        "'I loved talking with you. It is baby night so come get me later,' he added. 'Missing you so much. I can feel you in bed with me, though. Can't wait to hold you tightly every day and night.'A giddy Vallow responded: 'I'm missing you more!! I need you desperately! I can't wait! That would be great. What about the idea of you coming here Thursday or Friday. Or do u want me to come home?'\u00a0The texts continue with the pair discussing their future plans, a move to Hawaii and Daybell's plan to 'tighten the abs, get a full-body tan, grow my hair out.''This could be really good for both of us,' he added, with Vallow replying:\u00a0'I love that plan.'Earlier on Monday, Hart's testimony revealed that the couple talked about causing pain to children and\u00a0'giving them a reason to scream' if they act up, in chilling texts before her kids were killed.\u00a0The two children were last seen alive that September. At the time, JJ was just 7 and Tylee was a few days short of her 17th birthday. Their bodies were found the following June, buried in Chad Daybell\u2019s yard.\u00a0",
        "In the texts from the seized iCloud accounts belonging to Vallow, showed she texted Daybell about her niece's children being possessed in July 2019.",
        "In another exchange, Daybell - the alleged leader of their doomsday cult - told her he had 'turned up the pain' on her daughter Tylee and 'placed a spiritual virus in her.'In July 2019, Vallow took a trip with her niece Melanie Boudreaux and her two children who Daybell referred to '3s' in the texts. Her son JJ was also on the trip, but it is not known if Tylee was there. The '3s' refers to the couple's twisted rating system for 'dark' people they believed were possessed.Daybell had sent a text to Vallow asking if she wanted him to 'cause pain' to the two 3s she was riding with.Vallow told Daybell to hold off, but added if they started acting up again, 'we can zap them.' Daybell agreed and said: 'If they are going to act up, we'll at least give them a reason to scream.'Hart told the Ada County Courthouse in Boise that the 'references to hurting children and giving them a reason to scream are relevant.' He confirmed that he never saw any messages that depicted Vallow protesting the harm of anyone.Hart, who took the stand last week, has told jurors that messages between the pair show that they were plotting the killings of her then-husband Charles Vallow, her kids, and Daybell's wife.",
