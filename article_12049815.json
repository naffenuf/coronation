        "Johanita Kossiwa Dogbey was killed after going out to buy a birthday presentA man knifed two women and a man during an hour-long rampage in Brixton just days before he stabbed a female Christian charity worker to death near the O2 venue, a court has heard.",
        "Mohamed Nur is accused of murdering Johanita Dogbey, 31, on Bank Holiday Monday, as well as attacking two women and a man in a one-hour crime spree two day earlier.The 33-year-old defendant was arrested yesterday and charged today with murder plus two counts of possession of an offensive weapon as well as three counts of GBH with intent.Ms Dogbey was knifed to death in broad daylight as she walked alone through an alleyway while on the phone to her grandmother.The three separate attacks two days before on April 29 left two women and a man with slash wounds.",
        "Nur is alleged to have been holding two silver bladed weapons, taped together with blue cloth and rubber band wrapped, thought to be an open pair of scissors, on the day of the murder.The next day, May 2, he is alleged to have had a piece of glass taped up to be a weapon in Brixton Road, not far from the murder scene. The three attacks were said to have been carried out in the space of around an hour in Town Hall Parade, Brixton Road and Acre Lane in Brixton, police said.At Croydon Magistrates' Court today, Nur appeared in the dock wearing a prison-issue blue jumper and tracksuit trousers. No pleas to the charges were entered and Nur only spoke to confirm his name, age, date of birth and to ask which prison he would be taken to.",
        "District Judge Polly Gledhill told the defendant the allegations are too serious to be heard at a magistrate's court and remanded him in custody.She said: 'Mr Nur faces an indictable only offence, the nature of the offence he is facing means he is not entitled to bail. Mr Nur your cases can only be dealt with in crown court due to the severity of the allegations. Until that hearing I am remanding you in custody.'Tom Gregson, representing the defendant, told the judge psychiatric issues will be dealt with in the case.Nur, of Bond Way, Vauxhall, south London, was remanded in custody until he appears at the Old Bailey next week.",
        "Ms Dogbey was\u00a0the founder of a charity that helped people suffering with sickle cell disease and a devout Christian who 'wanted to make the world a better place'.\u00a0The charity worker had been out to buy a present and was returning home for a birthday celebration.Fighting back the tears, Ms Dogbey's father Yao previously told MailOnline: 'We have no words at this moment. My daughter was beautiful and kind-hearted. I'm sorry, I can't say anything more.'Ms Dogbey's younger brother Maurice said: 'We are trying to understand what has happened and are completely broken. As far as we know there was no link between my sister and the attacker.",
        "'This whole thing has left us devastated. It's too much for us.'A family friend said: 'She was a genuinely good person who loved God and just wanted to make the world a better place. It's tragic that somebody who did so much good was killed like this.'Ms Dogbey was the founder of the Odette Foundation, a charity which worked with people suffering from sickle cell in Ghana and Togo.In addition to providing medical support, it also raised much needed funds for those afflicted by the disease.",
        "She was a regular visitor to the two West African countries as part of her charity work and also helped organise fund raising events in the UK.Ms Dogbey helped establish the organisation with her friend Naya Faya, who posted a number of moving social media tributes to her.In one she writes: 'God is within her she will not fall.'Away from her charity work, Ms Dogbey, a devout Christian regularly attended a church close to her Brixton home with her parents, with friends describing them as 'God fearing people.'She originated from Ghana and lived with her family only around 300 yards from where she was attacked, and they rushed to the scene within moments of it taking place."
