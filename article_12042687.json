        "Avoid post one or two horses\u00a0The 'post position' is the position at the starting gate a horse will start at in a race.\u00a0Cam says this can have big implications and instructs viewers: 'Do not bet on posts one or post two horses this week.'He notes that the last champion for post one came through in 1986, while the last post two champion scored a victory in 1978. This year's post one position horse is\u00a0Hit Show, while\u00a0Verifying is on post two.Form mattersCam highlights that 'momentum and form matters' and nine of the last 12 Derby winners were coming off a victory.\u00a0For this reason, it might be worth researching which of the competitors recently won races and hedging your bets with them.\u00a0Unraced as juveniles\u00a0'Beware horses who went unraced as juveniles,' Cam says. In the comment section he goes on to reveal that\u00a0only one horse - the 2018 Triple Crown winner Justify - ever won the Kentucky Derby without racing as a two-year-old.",
