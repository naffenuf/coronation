        "Ed Sheeran has won a US lawsuit which alleged he copied another artist\u2019s work following a two-week trial in New York.",
        "The global superstar faced similar claims of copyright infringement last year at the High Court in London, but he emerged victorious.Here the PA news agency takes a closer look at the British superstar\u2019s latest legal battle.\u2013 Why was Sheeran sued?The British musician was taken to court in the US over allegations he copied parts of Marvin Gaye\u2019s hit song Let\u2019s Get It On for his own track Thinking Out Loud.The family of Ed Townsend, the co-writer of the 1973 soul classic, claimed that Sheeran\u2019s 2014 song bore \u201cstriking similarities\u201d to Gaye\u2019s track and that Sheeran had copied \u201csubstantial parts of it\u201d.During the trial, lawyers for the plaintiffs said the case was about \u201cgiving credit where credit is due\u201d.Kathryn Townsend Griffin, Townsend\u2019s daughter and the leading plaintiff in the case, said she had not wanted to take Sheeran to court, but that she had to \u201cprotect my father\u2019s legacy\u201d.\u2013 What were the specific allegations?Townsend\u2019s family claimed that Sheeran had infringed on their interest in Gaye\u2019s song by copying its \u201charmonic progressions, melodic and rhythmic elements\u201d \u2013 which they described as the \u201cheart\u201d of the track.\u201cThe defendants copied the \u2018heart\u2019 of Let\u2019s (Get It On) and repeated it continuously throughout Thinking (Out Loud),\u201d their claim stated, adding that it had been done \u201cwithout consent, credit or compensation\u201d.",
        "\u201cAs a result, members of the public have been deceived and/or confused into thinking that Thinking (Out Loud) is the independent creation of the defendants.\u201dThe complaint added the conduct, which had resulted in \u201cillegal revenues\u201d, had been \u201cknowing and wilful\u201d.\u2013 What has Sheeran said about the allegations?Sheeran had denied the allegations, saying he created the song with collaborator Amy Wadge independently, and would have been an \u201cidiot\u201d to have copied the song.At times during his own testimony he became audibly frustrated, and said he could not believe how someone would seek to \u201cdiminish\u201d one of his songs by alleging he had stolen it.\u201cI find it really insulting,\u201d he said, according to the Associated Press, adding that testimony given by one of the plaintiffs\u2019 expert witnesses was \u2018criminal\u2019.Sheeran also sang and played guitar several times while in the witness box, to explain his songwriting process.\u2013 How much was he sued for?Damages in the case were unspecified, though the family said they were interested in \u201call of the money that is generated from the distribution and any other exploitation\u201d of Sheeran\u2019s track.Their original complaint stated that Sheeran had earned an \u201cundetermined, yet substantial\u201d sum from the success of Thinking Out Loud.They requested an accounting in order to \u201cdetermine the sums rightfully due to the plaintiff and that those sums be paid to them\u201d \u2013 as well as legal fees.",
        "The family also requested a preliminary and permanent injunction against any future recording, distribution or public performance of Thinking Out Loud.\u2013 What was the outcome?A verdict in favour of Sheeran was returned in New York on Thursday, after just under three hours of jury deliberation.Jurors found that Sheeran and Wadge had \u201cindependently created\u201d Thinking Out Loud and had not infringed on the copyright of Gaye\u2019s song.After the verdict was returned, Sheeran said: \u201cI\u2019m obviously very happy with the outcome of this case and it looks like I\u2019m not going to have to retire from my day job after all.\u201dHe reportedly previously said that should he lose the trial he would be \u201cdone\u201d with music, though it remains unspecified what he meant.\u2013 What are the implications?During his evidence Sheeran said that since the start of his US trial he had received encouragement and support from other singers, who had shared their own concerns about litigation resulting from their songwriting.Last year he spoke out about a \u201cdamaging\u201d culture of \u201cunwarranted\u201d legal claims against songwriters, after winning a similar High Court copyright battle over his track Shape Of You.The singer said legal challenges are \u201cway too common\u201d and also detailed the effect on his mental health and creativity.",
        "He added that he would \u201ccontinue to stand up against baseless claims\u201d in order to protect the \u201crights and the integrity\u201d of musical creativity."
