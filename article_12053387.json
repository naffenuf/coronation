        "Stacy Lentz says LGBTQ+ activists may join conservatives boycotting companyLentz says they'll go 'extinct' if 'they are not fully on the side of equality'Stonewall previously refused to serve Bud Light during New York Pride in 2021\u00a0A longtime LGBTQ+ activist believes Bud Light will face backlash from her community in the wake of the Dylan Mulvaney controversy.\u00a0",
        "Mulvaney, 26, posted herself drinking Bud Light at the start of April 2023 using the hashtag #budlightpartner.\u00a0She posted the content to coincide with the NCAA March Madness\u00a0tournament, before joking she didn't know what sport she was promoting.The disastrous marketing bid has seen sales for the American flagship beer plummet 26 percent, despite Anheuser-Busch reporting first-quarter earnings of $1.65billion and with conservatives everywhere professing to boycott the company.\u00a0Stacy Lentz, the co-owner of the famous Stonewall Inn where many suggest the modern LGBTQ+ movement began, expressed sympathy for Mulvaney in an interview and believes people like her may begin giving up their Bud Lights.'As far as marketing, I hope and think they realized that as a brand they will be extinct in a few years if they are not fully on the side of equality, as that is what the Gen Z consumer expects and demands,' Lentz said.\u00a0",
        "She also told Newsweek that the brewery had 'missed an opportunity to stand by their commitment to the trans community by pandering to and giving into transphobic outcries.'Stonewall Inn, the New York City haunt, was where the 1969 Stonewall Riots launched,\u00a0widely considered the beginning to the LGBTQ+ movement in the United States.\u00a0The landmark is no stranger to controversy with the brewer, refusing to serve Bud Light during New York Pride in 2021 over Anheuser-Busch's donations to anti-LGBTQ+ politicians.\u00a0\u00a0",
        "Lentz also said 'this whole thing was not handled well and she was caught in the middle of a horrible fire storm,' showing concern over Mulvaney in the wake of the backlash.\u00a0It comes as the company is seemingly facing outrage and potential boycott from all sides of the political spectrum, though largely centered around conservatives.\u00a0\u00a0Anheuser-Busch reported first-quarter earnings of $1.65billion, which topped Wall Street expectations.\u00a0The brewer posted revenue of $14.21 billion in the period, which also beat forecasts, with the shares rising 6 percent since the beginning of the year and 12 percent in 12 months.It's unclear if the boycott had any impact on these figures, and whether a larger impact on the firm's finances will be visible for the second quarter of the financial year if the controversy and boycotts rumble on.\u00a0\u00a0",
        "The brewing giants now claim that the beer can and social media posts were not meant to be 'for production or sale to the general public.Todd Allen, most recently the global vice president of Budweiser, has been announced as the new vice president of marketing for Bud Light \u2013 after Heinerscheid and Blake took a leave of absence.After the post on April 1, Anheuser-Busch lost more than $6billion in market capitalization in just six days.",
        "The beer giant's stock roughly traded at just over five percent decrease in the total share value and the company's market capitalization stood at $113.33billion.Mulvaney posted several videos and images on Instagram for the paid partnership, but it is unclear exactly how much she was paid.It comes after DailyMail.com obtained documents that showed the brewing giant hired two former GOP aides on the same day it went public with Mulvaney's video.Both Sean McLean and Emily Lynch were named as lobbyists for Bud Light's parent company on April 1.It states the firm, owned by Belgium-based giant InBev, hired lobbyists Origin Advocacy for representation on 'general policy regarding the alcohol-beverage industry.'The account is being handled by Origin founder McLean, and employee Lynch, who are both veteran staffers to GOP politicians.McLean previously worked for Senator Ted Cruz and was the White House liaison for the Commerce Department under President Donald Trump.He also once worked as the legislative director for Senator Marsha Blackburn when she served in the US House of Representatives.Lynch worked as committee staff for Senator Susan Collins before later working as a legislative assistant for Representative Virginia Foxx and former Senator Kelly Ayotte.According to the New York Post, the company has promised 'there will be an improved screening process before any marketing hits the public.'",
        "It comes after Coors Light and Miller Lite both saw bumps in sales while the Anheuser-Busch-owned brewer saw them plunge.",
        "In the week after the campaign launched, April 1, Bud Light dollar sales dipped 6 percent, as Coors Light rose 3.5 percent and Miller Lite 3.1 percent.As the backlash ramped up against Anheuser-Busch, with Kid Rock opening fire on several cases of the beer, their sales dropped 17 percent in the week of April 18.By comparison, Coors Light saw sales rise by 10.6 percent, while Miller Lite scooped up even more profit with sales rising 11.5 percent.Last week sales of Bud Light had risen slightly, with the company seeing just a 6.7 percent dip in sales, with both their rivals seeing a huge increase of 18 percent.Bud Light is the largest beer brand in the US, but their decision to work with Mulvaney has seriously affected the company.During the NCAA basketball tournament from March 18 to April 1, it was the clear leader of all Light beers, up 15 percent, according to Brewbound.Following the Mulvaney campaign, it trailed other beers by at least six percent in bars and restaurants.",
        "Between April 2 and April 15, Beer Board says that their overall volume of sales at bars and restaurants dropped by 34.7 percent.",
        "Bud Light has now declined into the fourth spot of the most popular draft beer during the second week of the controversy \u2013 losing out to Coors Light.Vice president of marketing Alissa Heinerscheid had been hired to overhaul Bud Light's marketing in June 2022 with the idea of freshening up its image.She spoke out before the controversial campaign to say that the company had a 'fratty' image that needed to be changed.Daniel Blake stepped down shortly after Heinerscheid, with both saying they were taking a 'leave of absence'.The firm said both bosses 'decided' to temporarily step down, but their decisions were reportedly not voluntary.'Given the circumstances, Alissa has decided to take a leave of absence which we support. Daniel has also decided to take a leave of absence,' the company said.Blake is a nine-year veteran of Anheuser-Busch and oversaw marketing for both Bud Light and Budweiser.",
        "A replacement wasn't immediately announced. Heinerscheid's job was taken over by Todd Allen, who recently served as global vice president of Budweiser.Blake, who is based in New York, was promoted to group vice president of Anheuser-Busch's mainstream brands in May 2022, according to his LinkedIn page. Before that, he was group VP of marketing for Budweiser and value brands.",
        "On March 30, Heinerschied gave an interview to a business podcast in which she said she wanted to make Bud Light less 'fratty' and more 'inclusive'.Two days later, on April 1, Mulvaney - who began transitioning to a woman in 2021 - was unveiled as a brand partner.Several famous faces slammed the brand for their decision after pro-Trump Kid Rock shot the cans and commented: 'F*** Bud Light, and f*** Anheuser-Busch. Have a terrific day.'John Rich also publicly denounced the brand, saying he would be removing it from his bar in Nashville.Mulvaney has hit back at her critics over the Bud Light deal, telling Rosie O'Donnell on her podcast: 'The reason that I think I am so\u2026I'm an easy target is because I'm so new to this.'I think going after a trans woman that's been doing this for like 20 years is a lot more difficult. I think maybe they think that there's some sort of chance with me \u2026 But what is their goal?",
        "'These people, they don't understand me, and anything that I do or say then somehow gets taken out of context and is used against me, and it's so sad because everything I try to put out is positive.'It's trying to connect with others that maybe don't understand me. It's to make people laugh or to make a kid feel seen.'In the turmoil that ensued after the announcement of the collaboration, Anheuser-Busch issued a statement saying it supported the brand's decision to work with Mulvaney.They added: 'Anheuser-Busch works with hundreds of influencers across our brands as one of many ways to authentically connect with audiences across various demographics.'From time to time, we produce unique commemorative cans for fans and for brand influencers, like Mulvaney. This commemorative can was a gift to celebrate a personal milestone and is not for sale to the general public.'",
        "Bud Light then released a patriotic new advertisement for Budweiser featuring its iconic Clydesdale horses, in an apparent attempt to reset following the controversy.The one-minute spot features shots of the iconic Clydesdales galloping across the country, in open fields, and past landmarks including the Lincoln Memorial and the New York City skyline.However, online users slammed the ad as a pathetic attempt to right the ship that was permanently sent in the wrong direction with the Mulvaney partnership.On April 14, US CEO Brendan Whitworth delivered an apology.'We never intended to be part of a discussion that divides people. We are in the business of bringing people together over a beer,' he said in a statement.He added: 'My time serving this country taught me the importance of accountability and the values upon which America was founded: freedom, hard work and respect from one another.''I care deeply about this country, this company, our brands and our partners,' he added.'I spend much of my time traveling across America, listening to and learning from our customers, distributors and others. Moving forward I will continue to work tirelessly to bring great beers to consumers across our nation.'"
