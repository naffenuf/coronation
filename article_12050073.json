        "According to the Mail On Sunday, boss Barbara Broccoli has made it clear she wanted the next actor to portray the character for 15 years, meaning that the 30-year-old is the perfect age to step into the role.It is also thought that Broccoli and her team are keen to have an ethnic-minority star to play 007 so the franchise is reflective of modern society.However, some executives are fearful his appearance on reality show Celebrity Big Brother in 2011, when he finished in fifth place, will tarnish his chances of getting the job because previous Bonds have been more highbrow.The debonair Burnley-born actor's first role was as a child model for Marks &amp; Spencer when he was ten.

That is a dream for Barbara who is very taken with him.'",
