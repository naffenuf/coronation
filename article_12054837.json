        "Frank Lampard encouraged his players to celebrate with a beer or glass of wine after Chelsea took a \u201csmall step forward\u201d by halting their six-match losing streak with a 3-1 win at Bournemouth.",
        "Late goals from Benoit Badiashile and Joao Felix earned the Blues an overdue victory after Cherries defender Matias Vina cancelled out Conor Gallagher\u2019s early header at Vitality Stadium.Success on the south coast was Lampard\u2019s first since returning to Stamford Bridge on an interim basis a month ago and a fitting way to cap his 100th game in Premier League management.The former England and Blues midfielder urged his team to embrace the club\u2019s first triumph in almost two months but warned they cannot ease off going into their final four fixtures of a dismal campaign.\u201cThey should enjoy it and we\u2019re happy because when you don\u2019t have that feeling for a while, it gradually knocks you down,\u201d said Lampard.\u201cIt was very evident in the dressing room from coming in that there was a lot of picking up that needed to be done and unfortunately you need results to come in line with that to keep you stepping forward, so that\u2019s been tough.",
        "\u201cToday was a nice small step forward.\u201cThe lads are all human, we\u2019re all affected in similar ways when you\u2019re not winning games or you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re at your best and the only way to get through that is to fight and to work through it.",
        "\u201cI\u2019ve been in relative periods where they\u2019re tough, so absolutely they should enjoy tonight and have a beer or have a glass of wine or do whatever they do.\u201cBut we cannot take our foot of the pedal in terms of trying to take steps forward until the end of this season because it\u2019s important.\u201dVictory in Dorset moved the two-time European champions on to 42 points, three ahead of their hosts, albeit they remain in the bottom half of the table.Bournemouth had the better of the chances before the late drama, with Dango Ouattara squandering a golden opening by heading over from inside the six-yard box.Badiashile and Felix punished that profligacy in the final eight minutes, leaving Chelsea supporters to salute the long-awaited win with ironic chants of \u201cwe are staying up\u201d.Some of the away end had jeered substitutes Hakim Ziyech and Raheem Sterling but the pair responded by claiming assists for Badiashile and Felix respectively.Lampard hopes to help rebuild the bond between fans and players and backed the under-fire duo to show their true class following underwhelming campaigns.\u201cOur fans were fantastic today so I personally appreciate their support,\u201d said Lampard.\u201cI appreciate we had a moment on the end of the pitch where everyone feels good for a day.",
        "\u201cI think that\u2019s important to build a connection between players and fans.\u201cOpinion can always change in a period but Hakim and Raheem want to do well, as football players they\u2019ve got big talent both of them.\u201cI think their class is permanent and I\u2019m pleased for them for having some impact when they came on.\u201dBournemouth boss Gary O\u2019Neil rued his side\u2019s missed opportunities.\u201cI thought it was an even contest,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were lots of bits in it that I liked.\u201cWhen we were on top, Vina has a one-on-one where Kepa (Arrizabalaga) makes a good save, Kepa makes a great block from Dango as well from four, five yards out and obviously the massive chance, Dango\u2019s free header.\u201cIf we get our noses in front then the game will probably finish very differently.\u201cI\u2019m disappointed we weren\u2019t clinical enough and then we get punished at the other end.\u201cWe were well in the game.\u201d"
