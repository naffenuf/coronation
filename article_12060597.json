        "Anti-monarchy campaigners arrested ahead of the King\u2019s coronation are considering legal action against the Metropolitan Police after being told no charges will be brought against them.",
        "Republic chief executive Graham Smith also called on Monday for a \u201cfull inquiry\u201d into who authorised the arrests during the \u201cdisgraceful episode\u201d.Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has backed the Met over the dozens of arrests of protesters amid concerns they were cracking down on dissent on Saturday at the behest of politicians.",
        "The force made 64 arrests on coronation day, with 46 people bailed after being detained on suspicion of causing a public nuisance or breaching the peace.But Mr Smith said the eight protesters from Republic detained in London have all been told no charges will be brought against them.He told the PA news agency: \u201cThe speed with which they did this demonstrates they were very quickly aware they had made a very serious error of judgment and there will be action taken again.\u201cI\u2019m obviously relieved they dropped it so quickly but very angry they even went down this road, robbing people of their liberty for absolutely no reason.\u201cThere was no evidence of any ability or intent to commit any offence and they simply decided to arrest us and that is outrageous.\u201dScotland Yard has been asked about the result of the Republic arrests.Earlier in the day, Mr Sunak defended Scotland Yard\u2019s operation and denied officers were acting under pressure from ministers.",
        "\u201cThe police are operationally independent of Government, they\u2019ll make these decisions based on what they think is best,\u201d he told broadcasters during a visit to Hertfordshire.\u201cActually, I\u2019m grateful to the police and everyone who played a part in ensuring that this weekend has gone so well, so successfully and so safely, that was an extraordinary effort by so many people and I\u2019m grateful to them for all their hard work.\u201d",
        "But Mr Smith accused Scotland Yard of having \u201cevery intention\u201d of arresting demonstrators and of having \u201clied\u201d in discussions ahead of the planned protests.The campaigner said he was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to cause a public nuisance unloading placards in St Martin\u2019s Lane, Westminster.He said police initially accused him of being equipped to \u201clock-on\u201d to an object or building, which the new Public Order Act made a jailable offence.Mr Smith denies this was his intention and believes the Met had used some straps they were carrying as a \u201cpretext\u201d to prevent their protest.He raised fresh concerns about the Public Order Act signed into law last week, which tips the balance against protest, including by lowering the definition of \u201cserious disruption\u201d. I understand the Labour Party said they wouldn\u2019t repeal this law, which is pretty disgraceful if true, this law needs to be repealed  Graham Smith, Republic  ",
        "\u201cThe whole thing was a deliberate attempt to disrupt and diminish our protest,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme.\u201cThey stopped us because the law was introduced, rushed in last week, to give them the powers to stop us on any flimsy pretext.\u201cThat law means we no longer in this country have the right to protest, we only have the freedom to protest contingent on the permission of senior police officers and politicians and it\u2019s my view that those senior police officers were under immense pressure from politicians.\u201cI understand the Labour Party said they wouldn\u2019t repeal this law, which is pretty disgraceful if true, this law needs to be repealed.\u201dLabour frontbencher Andrew Gwynne said the Act gave \u201cdisproportionate\u201d powers to the police but the party was not committing the party to repealing it if it enters government.Instead, the shadow public health minister told Sky News: \u201cI think the next Labour government will look very carefully at this legislation.\u201dMr Gwynne defended the right to protest and suggested revellers supporting the coronation should have drowned out the dissent.\u201cThat would\u2019ve been the appropriate approach, to drown out those that wanted to protest rather than maybe heavy-handed practice that some have suggested may have taken place,\u201d he said.",
        " Protesting can take place in this country but it\u2019s the level to which you want to perform that protest that we have to balance and deal with what\u2019s put in front of us impartially. That\u2019s what was done  Ken Marsh, Metropolitan Police Federation  Ken Marsh, head of the Metropolitan Police Federation representing officers from the rank of constable to chief inspector, said police were acting both lawfully and \u201cimpartially\u201d.\u201cProtesting can take place in this country but it\u2019s the level to which you want to perform that protest that we have to balance and deal with what\u2019s put in front of us impartially. That\u2019s what was done,\u201d he told Today.Westminster City Council has raised concerns that women\u2019s safety volunteers were among those arrested after rape alarms were seized.The Met said it had received intelligence that people were planning to use the devices to disrupt the procession.Caroline Russell said the London Assembly\u2019s Police and Crime Committee that she chairs will be questioning the Met over the \u201cworrying\u201d arrests.The Green politician told Today: \u201cIt felt like for someone who was trying to protest, and trying to do it by the book, it was very difficult to understand what the rules were.\u201cIt seems absolutely extraordinary that those people who were volunteering, they were out there handing out flip flops to people who could no longer walk in their high heels because they\u2019d had a bit too much to drink and handing out rape alarms.",
        "\u201cIt just seems extraordinary that they got caught up in the Met\u2019s safety net. How? It just feels very odd.\u201dIn total the Met made 64 arrests during the coronation day.Four charges have been brought, including over a religiously aggravated public order allegation and class A drugs possession.London Mayor Sadiq Khan has demanded \u201cclarity\u201d from the force\u2019s leaders on the arrests."
