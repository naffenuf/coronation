        "What's been said?Speaking after his win in Azerbaijan, Perez was asked to give his thoughts on the battle with Verstappen in Baku.\u2018It really worked out today for us. I think it was very close between us, we pushed to the maximum today, we both clipped the wall a few times,' Perez told Sky Sports.\u2018It\u2019s a track where you require a lot of confidence, a lot of corners, and you see that a lot of drivers clip walls during the race. It\u2019s all about confidence, lap after lap and making sure you\u2019re on top of your car.\u2019",

I\u2019m working towards that, there\u2019s so much you can talk about outside the car, it\u2019s important to deliver on the track.\u2018I think with all the issues we had in qualifying in Melbourne we should be leading the championship, definitely there is everything to believe we can do well this year.\u2019"
