I know on this page its more to do with my fashion, work etc. ive been more real on my @superpowerswithtasha page.'I don't often talk about the struggles that come with being deaf and wearing a cochlear implant.\u00a0",
        "'I deal with social anxiety massively, a lot of that came from the abelist comments i received and still do to this day, common thoughts that run through my head is 'what if i cant hear whoever is speaking to me' 'what if i completely misunderstand' 'what if my voice gets judged' 'what if someone comes over and takes out my implant' and so many more.\u00a0'It's something im still coping with and its a journey for sure! Most of the time i'd rather just stay in my lil flat and not face it.\u00a0'I also deal with concentration fatigue - i have to lip read, focus in on conversations, by the end of the day i suffer with migraines and headaches, i'll be completely worn out and drained to the point i can't even speak. Hence why i nap alot. napping helps me to recharge and get my energy back!\u00a0",
        "'I do have my down days - it's normal to have these days!'But at the same time im so grateful for my cochlear implant. its opened so many doors and opportunities for me. Just because I have a cochlear implant doesn't mean I'm fixed. I have my struggles behind closed doors and so does everyone.'i just wanted to share more of my reality AND everyone's reality that has a cochlear implant / deafness / hearing loss!!! for those that are going through the same thing - you're not alone! Representation is important.",
        "My podcast is coming very soon, thank you all for being patient and I can't wait to share with you all, it really is empowering.'"
