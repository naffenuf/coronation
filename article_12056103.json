        "Camilla's ivory dress which was designed by Couturier and close friend Bruce Oldfield, who also worked closely with Diana during her time as a working Royal, was made from Peau de Soie, a silk fabric.The gown was embellished with silver embroidery which was\u00a0woven by Stephen Walters in Suffolk.With an ivory, silver and gold colour palette, bracelet length sleeves, a strong shoulder and a wide V-neck neckline, the gown was in Camilla\u2019s signature silhouette, a modest neckline, and an elongated waist.The mother-of-two accessorised the gown with matching shoes made by British designer Elliot Zed, and the same necklace that Queen Elizabeth wore to her coronation back in 1953.",
