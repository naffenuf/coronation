        "Asked about Nicola Sturgeon leaving office he said: \u2018I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever met her. I\u2019m not sure that I ever met her. I dealt with Alex Salmond. And I got along great with him, actually, until the windmills started coming all over Scotland.\u2019Also, when pressed on comments made by First Minister Humza Yousaf that hinted at Mr Trump being anti-Muslim he said: \u2018I am not anti-Muslim. I have friends that are Muslim and great friends and frankly, leaders of countries that are Muslim and I\u2019ve had great relationships.\u2019He added: \u2018But I don\u2019t know him. I hope he\u2019s going to do a great job and I\u2019m sure he\u2019s going to be a lot better than Sturgeon. I just hope the new man is going to do a much better job than she did.\u2019Asked if he felt Scotland should remain part of the UK he said: \u2018I think they should. Yeah, I think they should. I think they should all work together. And you know, there\u2019s a great love of the Queen. The Queen kept it together.\u2019"
