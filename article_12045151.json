        "Police have arrested a man accused of opening fire inside the waiting room of an Atlanta medical practice on Wednesday, killing one woman and wounding four others.",
        "Authorities were in the city\u2019s midtown neighbourhood shortly after noon in search of the suspect, who fled after the shooting.Police said in a statement on Wednesday evening that the gunman, who they identified as 24-year-old Deion Patterson, was captured in Cobb County, just northwest of Atlanta.Authorities said Patterson shot five women on the 11th floor of a Northside Medical building, which is in a commercial area filled with office towers and high-rise apartments.News of the shooting prompted workers and civilians to shelter in place for hours.Patterson had an appointment at the medical practice and shortly after arriving shot the first victim, law enforcement officials said.The shooting lasted approximately two minutes before Patterson left the building and went to a Shell gas station and took a pickup truck that had been left running and unattended, authorities said.Atlanta Police chief Darin Schierbaum said a 39-year-old woman was pronounced dead at the scene of the shooting.The Fulton County medical examiner\u2019s office identified her as Amy St Pierre.The four wounded victims were also women, aged 25, 39, 56 and 71.Atlanta Police deputy chief Charles Hampton Jr said they remained in a critical but stable condition on Wednesday night.Mr Hampton declined to discuss any details of the investigation or possible motive, saying: \u201cWhy he did what he did, all of that is still under investigation.\u201d",
        "Patterson\u2019s mother, Minyone Patterson, who police said had accompanied her son to the medical office, said her son, a former Coast Guardsman, had \u201csome mental instability going on\u201d from medication he received from the Veterans Affairs health system that he began taking on Friday.She said her son had wanted Ativan to deal with anxiety and depression but that the Veterans Affairs would not give it to him because they said it would be \u201ctoo addicting\u201d.She is a nurse and said she told them he would only have taken the proper dosage \u201cbecause he listened to me in every way\u201d.\u201cThose families, those families,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re hurting because they wouldn\u2019t give my son his damn Ativan.\u201cThose families lost their loved ones because he had a mental break because they wouldn\u2019t listen to me.\u201dShe ended the call without saying what medication her son had been taking.\u201cWe are horrified and saddened to hear of the active shooter situation in Atlanta today,\u201d Veterans Affairs press secretary Terrence Hayes said in an emailed statement.\u201cDue to patient privacy, we cannot discuss the Veteran\u2019s personal information without written consent.\u201dIn a statement, the US Coast Guard said Patterson had joined the service in 2018 and was discharged from active duty in January.",
        "Atlanta mayor Andre Dickens was happy Patterson was arrested and taken into custody alive so he can be prosecuted.\u201cRight now, we\u2019ve had a successful end to a traumatic day,\u201d Mr Dickens said, while also advocating for tougher gun laws and stressing the importance of police training.\u201cI hope the city, the region, rests easy that he is in custody, but I also hope that we will stay vigilant to continue to look at a future where individuals who shouldn\u2019t have a gun in possession won\u2019t have one, and also that individuals are brought to justice, and also that we deal with these things that are mental health or easy access to guns.\u201d"
