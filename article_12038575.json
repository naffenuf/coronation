        "They will raise 'concerns' about cartoon when they talk to boss Katharine Viner\u00a0Ms Viner faces calls to resign over caricature of ex-BBC chairman Richard SharpThe UK's largest Jewish community body is to meet with The Guardian's editor-in-chief, after the newspaper was accused of publishing a 'sickening' anti-Semitic cartoon.",
        "The Board of Deputies of British Jews will raise their 'concerns' about the cartoon 'as well as other examples of questionable output' when they talk to newspaper boss Katharine Viner.Miss Viner has been facing calls to resign over the offensive caricature of ex-BBC chairman Richard Sharp which included Jewish stereotypes.The controversy comes not long after The Guardian's sister-title, The Observer, sparked fury by publishing a letter by Labour MP, Diane Abbott which suggested Jewish people do not suffer racism.It is understood the meeting with Miss Viner was proposed by the Board of Deputies.",
        "There have been concerns from people in the Jewish community that the apology from the newspaper over the cartoon in Saturday's newspaper had not been fulsome enough.Drawn by Martin Rowson, the image depicting Mr Sharp, who is Jewish, was accused of containing a series of anti-Semitic tropes.It showed the ex-Goldman Sachs banker with 'outsized grotesque features' carrying a box from the bank stuffed with a squid, Rishi Sunak's head, and what appeared to be gold coins.When complaints about his image began appearing online, Mr Rowson, 64, said in a thousand-word apology: 'What I'm feeling now is enormous regret, idiocy and deep shame.'He said he knew Mr Sharp was Jewish because they both attended the fee-paying Merchant Taylors' School in north London, but insisted that fact 'never crossed my mind as I drew him'.",
        "Mr Sharp stepped down from his BBC role at the of last week after he broke rules by not disclosing his involvement in Boris Johnson's personal finances.A statement from the Board of Deputies this afternoon, said: 'We can confirm that the editor-in-chief of The Guardian has agreed to meet us to discuss concerns regarding the cartoon in Saturday's paper, as well as other examples of questionable output.'We will update our Deputies and the wider community on this in due course.'According to a report in the Jewish Chronicle the group is also set to discuss previous drawings by another cartoonist, Steve Bell, which the newspaper had also previously published.In 2012 Mr Bell was criticised for a cartoon which showed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a puppet master, who was in control of then-foreign secretary William Hague and Middle East envoy at the time Tony Blair.Dave Rich, who is policy director of Jewish charity, the Community Security Trust told the Jewish Chronicle the cartoon of Mr Sharp 'falls squarely into an anti-Semitic tradition of depicting Jews with outsized grotesque features, often in conjunction with money and power'.A Guardian spokesman said: 'The Guardian apologises to Mr Sharp, to the Jewish community and to anyone offended. We have received a small number of complaints about the cartoon. The Guardian's independent readers' editor is considering these and will respond in due course.'"
