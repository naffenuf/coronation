'I would be so upset if something I planned to eat was gone.''I've been married for 15 years and and your take out leftovers belong to you,' another woman said. 'I would never eat my husband's leftovers, and he would get an earful if he didn't ask before finishing my food.'",
        "A third wrote: 'It's about respect - if I really want my partner's food, I have to ask first and readily accept 'no' as an answer. It's common courtesy, I think your boyfriend was being extremely rude.'"
