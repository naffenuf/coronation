        "Malik Tillman\u2019s loan spell at Rangers has ended through injury as boss Michael Beale revealed Alfredo Morelos and Ryan Kent have not been offered new deals.",
        "The 20-year-old attacking midfielder\u00a0joined the Ibrox club on loan from German giants Bayern Munich last summer with the cinch Premiership outfit having the first option to buy with the fee reported to be around \u00a35million.Tillman had to come off in last week\u2019s Scottish Cup semi-final defeat by Celtic at Hampden Park which effectively ended hopes of silverware, with the hamstring injury which rules him out of the last five fixtures.Ahead of the cinch Premiership game against Aberdeen at Ibrox on Sunday, Beale said: \u201cUnfortunately that is the end of Malik\u2019s season.\u201cHe has got a hamstring injury, he has gone back to Bayern for them to have a look at him as well.\u201cHe has had his scan. It is a hugely sad ending to the season for him because he is obviously a fine young player and he has performed well for the club so far this season.",
        "\u201cThat (talk of permanent deal) is all still on-going in the background as well.\u201cMe and Malik are in a great place on a personal level.\u201cHe\u2019s been brilliant for the club and I think brilliant for me in my time here.\u201cHe\u2019s a player I think has a really high ceiling \u2013 as high as anyone I\u2019ve worked with in my time here at Rangers.",
        "\u201cThere\u2019s areas of his game that at 20 years old he certainly has to brush up on but that\u2019s why he\u2019s come on loan.\u201cWe said we\u2019d park the conversation until the middle of May because there\u2019s a lot around it. We want to get to end of the season.\u201cAnd Malik has got a say in this as well. Obviously the two clubs have been talking back and forth and there\u2019s agreements between them.\u201cBut the most important person is Malik. If Malik wants to be here in Glasgow then it\u2019s something we can make happen.\u201cLikewise if he\u2019s unsure\u2026\u201cWe\u2019d said we\u2019d park the conversation until the middle of May and nothing has changed on that.\u201dAfter the Hoops defeat Beale promised the \u201cbiggest rebuild in years\u201d and gave a strong hint that striker Morelos and Kent, both out of contract in the summer, would depart the club.The former QPR boss said: \u201cThey have been two fantastic players for the club.\u201cWe haven\u2019t come forward with a contract offer, both have been free to speak to other clubs for a while now.\u201cBut in terms of the\u00a0next five games they are Rangers players and they will continue to be so until anything announced officially.\u201d"
