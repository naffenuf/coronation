        "David Huber was reportedly stressed after being told to leave his dog businessHe is believed to have travelled from Cumbria to target Buckingham Palace\u00a0A dog breeder who allegedly sparked a security scare at Buckingham Palace days before the Coronation has competed at Crufts in the past, it can be revealed.",
        "Neighbours of David Huber say he may have snapped and travelled to London after being told by his boss he was being kicked out of the kennels he ran in Cumbria.The 60-year-old is understood to be the man arrested after allegedly throwing items - including suspected shotgun cartridges - over the gates of the Palace in the capital on Tuesday.Mr Huber, who described himself as an 'avid hunter', breeds Hungarian Vizslas at his remote Cumbrian cottage, but one farmer neighbour revealed he had recently been told he could be evicted.Photos posted online show the dog breeder posing with one of the breed at Crufts in 2014 and holding a certificate saying 'Very Highly Commended'.",
        "Farmer Roy Ashley, 72, said Huber had recently been told to leave Banks Gate Farm which he rents from a landlord.",
        "Mr Ashley, who keeps his horses on fields belonging to Banks Gate Farm, said:'The owner had given him notice to quit the kennels. Maybe that has set him off.'He had a woman with him for a while when he first moved in about two and a half years ago, but not now,' said Mr Ashley.'There was nowt wrong with him. And he was always alright with me.\u00a0He had fanciful big plans for the kennels, building new buildings and such like. He would have the odd girl working for him, looking after the dogs.\u00a0",
        "'But he didn't like anybody else near his dogs. If I was going down to get my horses I would have to ring him and he would open the gate, but I wasn't to go near the dogs.'Sheep farmer Frank Milburn, 51, said Huber moved into Banks Gate Farm, near Kirkby Stephen, Cumbria, about three years ago.Mr Milburn said: 'He has about 50 or 60 acres, but doesn't farm the land. He just breeds dogs, he gets most of his income from selling the dogs. It is a very successful business I believe.'He lives there alone, but he does have staff working for him, looking after the dogs and so on. I'm not sure whether one or two might board there.\u00a0'He has a huge amount of dogs. They'll need looking after,' said Mr Milburn. 'Daft lad, going down to London.'Mr Milburn went on: 'We are very remote around here and we don't see much of each other.'I don't know why he's gone down to London and done what he had done. There has been no suggestion he was planning anything from what I've seen of his recent activities.'",
        "Mr Milburn said Banks Gate Farm was a stables for horses before Huber bought it, and it was a working farm prior to that.",
        "Another farmer John Lord, 64, said: 'We had the police here this morning. They had got lost looking for David's farm, because it is hard to find.'He lives alone, and just has his dogs.'I cannot believe what he's done. I thought he was a quiet fella. I know him to say hello to, but no more really.'The farm has a heavy wooden gate, with an intercom, and the entrance is covered by CCTV.But the frequent barking of dogs from inside the modern indoor kennels on his could be heard."
