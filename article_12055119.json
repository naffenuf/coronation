        "Australia\u00a0said that it would not be lighting up the sails of Sydney Opera HouseOther public buildings were, however, illuminated in royal purpleRepublican France was captivated by the Coronation of Charles III\u00a0\u2013 but Australia\u2019s approach proved more ambivalent.",
        "As in other countries around the world, all major news channels and newspapers across the Channel wiped out their usual schedules to cover the King\u2019s ascension.According to Le Monde newspaper, there was a \u2018cascade\u2019 of congratulations for King Charles from Brussels to Washington following \u2018a Christian ceremony full of pomp and solemnity\u2019. Le Parisien, the French capital\u2019s leading tabloid, carried the headline: \u2018Let the Party Begin!\u2019But Britain\u2019s former colony on the other side of the world said that it would not be lighting up the sails of the Sydney Opera House \u2013 as it did last year to mark the death of Queen Elizabeth \u2013 on the grounds of cost.\u2018The New South Wales Government believe it has struck the right balance in terms of meeting community expectations on commemorating the occasion while being mindful of public expense,\u2019 a state government spokesman said.",
        "Other public buildings, including Parliament House in Canberra, were, however, illuminated in royal purple.On the whole, Coronation coverage abroad has been both warm and extensive. As international broadcasters beamed pictures of the pageantry into televisions, most leading news outlets served up live web updates to a global audience hungry for Royal detail.In Germany, the tabloid Bild proclaimed \u2018Finally King at 74. This is the crowning glory\u2019, before describing the double Coronation for Charles and Camilla as a \u2018sweetheart moment\u2019.",
        "In the United States, the New York Post led its website with a \u2018God Save King\u2019 banner, while news channel CNN provided intensive coverage, as did Fox News. The Washington Post offered its readers, \u2018memorable moments in photos and videos\u2019, plus an account how the Royal grandchildren had charmed audiences \u2018with yawns, waves\u2019.It was left to the New York Times \u2013 well-known for bashing Britain \u2013 to try to put a damper on things, summing up the Coronation as a \u2018cringing discomfort\u2019 and claiming that the whole thing had \u2018arrived with little fanfare\u2019."
