        "The 40-year-old right-hander gave up two runs and five hits and a walkHe started the season on the injured list with a muscle strain in his upper back\u00a0DailyMail.com provides all the latest international sports news\u00a0Justin Verlander made a rather forgettable debut on Thursday for the New York Mets - and it came in Detroit, against his former team, the Tigers.\u00a0",
        "The reigning American League Cy Young winner gave up back-to-back home runs in a 2-0 loss as Detroit's Eduardo Rodriguez threw eight scoreless innings to complete the three-game sweep.In the end, though, Verlander appreciated the crowd's collective gesture at the start of his outing.'Any athlete in any situation, when they gave that much to an organization and that much of their career somewhere, it's nice to hear the ovation, hear the applause,' said Verlander, who was drafted by the Tigers in 2004 and traded by them to Houston in 2017. 'That's a fan's way of saying thank you. Of course, it means a lot.'The 40-year-old right-hander gave up two runs and five hits and a walk while striking out five in his 79-pitch outing. He started the season on the injured list with a muscle strain in his upper back.\u00a0",
        "Riley Greene and Javier Baez hit solo homers off Verlander in the first inning and that was enough offense for the Tigers, who had 18,369 fans in the stands for their biggest crowd in nearly a month.'He's really good at what he does and he's been doing it for a long time now,' Greene said. 'When there's a big crowd, we feed off it. We look up and we're like, 'Yeah, let's go,' and we give it 1 percent more.'",
        "Rodriguez (3-2) gave up just two hits and one walk while striking out nine. Alex Lange pitched the ninth for his fifth save.Verlander (0-1) settled in after his rough start, showing signs of the form that led to him winning the Cy Young Award last year for the third time and helping the Astros win the World Series for a second time.Jeff Brigham, Dominic Leone and Drew Smith combined to throw three innings of scoreless relief, but the slumping Mets could not take advantage of their good pitching or opportunities on the base paths and were shut out for the sixth time this season.Brandon Nimmo singled off Lange with one out in the ninth inning and was thrown out trying to steal second, a questionable decision down two runs.Starling Marte struck out moments later to end the game.",
        "Nimmo said the decision to go was his alone.'That isn't what beat us,' Mets manager Buck Showalter said. 'What did we hit, one ball hard all day? So that's the thing that I dwell on.'Tommy Pham, one of three Mets to have one hit, was caught stealing by catcher Jake Rogers in the second inning.'In a close game, those plays matter so much,' Detroit manager A.J. Hinch said. 'We didn't allow them to create any momentum.'",
        "New York has lost nine of its last 11 games, falling to .500 after winning 14 of the first 21 games.Detroit has won three straight and is 13-17, bouncing back from a 2-9 start.RAYS 8, PIRATES 1Shane McClanahan became baseball's first six-game winner and Tampa Bay routed Pittsburgh.McClanahan (6-0) gave up one run on five hits over six innings, striking out nine and lowering his ERA to 2.03.

Tampa Bay has outscored its opponents 207-94. The Rays lead the majors with 64 home runs.Andrew McCutchen homered for the Bucs (20-11), who have their first three-game losing streak of the season.Yandy D\u00edaz got the first Rays hit off Mitch Keller (3-1) with two outs in a three-run third with a single and later scored when shortstop Rodolfo Castro was charged with an error after misplaying Harold Ram\u00edrez's grounder. Brandon Lowe made it 3-1 with a two-run double. McCutchen had hit a solo homer in the top of the third.",
        "YANKEES 4, GUARDIANS 3, 10 INNINGSWillie Calhoun hit a tying single in the ninth inning and pinch-hitter Jose Trevino came through with a game-ending single in the 10th, lifting New York to a win in a game it had two more players get hurt.",
        "Yankees center fielder Harrison Bader, back from the injured list just a day earlier, left after a ninth-inning collision with Isiah Kiner-Falefa, and Oswald Peraza limped off after hurting an ankle as a pinch runner.Calhoun and Jake Bauers homered in the fifth off Shane Bieber as the Yankees erased an early 2-0 deficit.Pinch-hitter Oscar Gonzalez had an RBI single in the top of the ninth to put Cleveland ahead 3-2, but Calhoun's singe in the bottom half of the inning tied the score.Albert Abreu (1-0) got Josh Naylor to ground into an inning-ending double play in the 10th to get the win.With the automatic runner on second, Trevor Stephan (1-1) walked Bauers leading off the bottom of the 10th and Kiner-Falefa sacrificed. Trevino then blooped a single to center over the drawn-in infield, boosting the Yankees to 17-15.Cleveland has lost five straight series and 11 of its last 16 games.",
        "NATIONALS 2, CUBS 1CJ Abrams had a tiebreaking RBI single in the seventh inning for the second consecutive game, and Washington beat Chicago.After Marcus Stroman pitched six crisp innings for the Cubs, the Nationals went ahead on four pitches by Adbert Alzolay (1-1).
