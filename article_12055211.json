        "Premiership clash had been in doubt due to London Irish's financial problemsTwo tries from Martin Gonzalez helped the Exiles secure a scrappy victoryExeter gave their youngsters a chance but they lacked the finishing touchLondon Irish coach Declan Kidney assured supporters that the club\u2019s financial future will be resolved after ending the season on a winning note.",
        "Saturday\u2019s match against Exeter was at risk of being called off after players were not paid on time amidst an ongoing takeover bid.Kidney\u2019s squad put the clubs\u2019s problems to one side as two tries from Juan Martin Gonzalez secured a scrappy victory.\u2018You see the measure of people in adversity,\u2019 said Kidney. \u2018The players have been brilliant, but so have coaches and the off-field team because it affected everybody.\u2018There\u2019s a rich future for this club on the pitch and I\u2019m sure the people off the pitch will do the business, they just need a bit of time.",
        "\u2018We entrust in them to be able to manage something between them. It\u2019s outside our remit but if you see that out there today, I imagine there would be a queue of people.\u2019Braving the rain, one child stood on the sidelines holding a \u2018save our club\u2019 banner. And things looked bleak when Exeter took the lead via Jacques Vermeulen, capitalising on Stu Townsend\u2019s box kicking. Irish had to defend their line as the visitors dominated the first half.With the likes of Jack Nowell and Stuart Hogg stepping down, Exeter gave their youngsters a chance but they lacked the finishing touch.",
        "Having made 20 metres through a huge driving maul, the London Irish fans finally had something to cheer about when Gonzalez pumped his legs through contact to level the score.",
        "The second-half was littered with errors. Both teams lost lineouts and missed kicks to touch, and Exeter\u2019s inaccuracy came back to haunt them when flanker Tom Pearson snatched the lead for the hosts from a lineout.Pouncing on a loose ball, Tom Hendrickson briefly moved Exeter back in front but they lacked the experience to see out the game.Paddy Jackson missed a penalty but his blushes were spared when Gonzalez scored late to seal the victory for Irish."
