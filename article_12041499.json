        "Ed Sheeran's father John said the star was 'so upset that he cannot be present'Ed Sheeran missed his beloved grandmother\u2019s funeral in Ireland today because he had to \u2018defend his integrity\u2019 in his court case in New York, his father told a packed church today.",
        "The superstar singer is believed to have tuned in online to bid goodbye to 98-year-old Anne \u2018Nancy\u2019 Sheeran who inspired one of his most personal songs, Nancy Mulligan.Today, his voice breaking with emotion, Ed\u2019s father John gave the eulogy for his mother, saying: \u2018I am very sad that our son Edward is unable to be here today. He\u2019s so upset that he cannot be present \u2013 he has to be thousands of miles away in a court in America defending his integrity.\u2018I know he is comforted by the fact that he was able to spend some precious time alone with his grandma just a month ago.\u2019Ed, 32, is fighting a copyright infringement case before a Manhattan Federal jury, based on alleged similarities between Marvin Gaye\u2019s \u2018Get it On\u2019 and Sheeran\u2019s hit \u2018Thinking Out Loud\u2019.",
        "He has even vowed that if the jury does find him guilty, he will be 'done' with music.And his absence from Nancy\u2019s funeral underlined just how much fighting the plagiarism accusation means to the singer.St Patrick\u2019s Church, Monaseed, Nancy\u2019s home village, set in the rolling hills of County Wexford, was full to the brim for the service and Guards of honour were provided by local boxing and golf clubs which she was involved with.",
        "John Sheeran, 65, Nancy\u2019s youngest son, who was attending with Ed\u2019s mother Imogen and elder brother Matthew, described his mother\u2019s life as \u2018rich and fulfilled\u2019.\u2018Nancy Mulligan was a country girl with a tomboy spirit helping out on the family farm,\u2019 he said\u2018Mum was a driven woman all her life, with a strong social conscience, and an innate desire to help others less fortunate than herself.She spent the first 20 years of her life in Ireland, then the next 40 in London, followed by 40 more back in Wexford.He said she was well aware of the rural poverty surrounding her with many classmates at Monaseed National School walking miles in bare feet, adding that \u2018For the rest of her life, her instinct lay with the underprivileged.\u2019He raised a wry chuckle from the congregation when he told them: \u2018Mum was expelled as a teenager from Loretto Abbey School after writing a poem, inspired by the cruelty of the nuns.\u2019He then turned to the \u2018Romeo and Juliet\u2019 love story of his parents, who met in London during WWII, referenced in Ed Sheeran\u2019s hit song.",
        "He said: \u2018After the U-boat threats had abated in the Irish Sea, Mum travelled to London in October 1944 to study nursing at Guy\u2019s Hospital.",
        "\u2018She recalled the challenges of looking after badly injured and burned fighter pilots and bomber crews who were undergoing plastic surgery, and she herself narrowly avoided injury or death from a devastating V-2 rocket explosion.\u2018Mum said she and her fellow nurses developed a spirit of resilience and defiance and a \u201cjust get the job done\u201d attitude, which is what she did for the rest of her life -- got the job done.\u2018Mum met Dad, a dental student, at a Guy\u2019s nurses\u2019 home party. Friendship turned into love, but the Northern Ireland Presbyterian side of dad's family did their utmost to end the relationship.\u2018Their wedding was attended by only one family member \u2013 mum\u2019s twin sister Peggy. They lived above that dental surgery in South London with a growing family. Eventually five boys and three girls. Mum joked to us that she had originally wanted 11 children so she could feel the football or cricket team.\u2019Joining the Sheerans in their grief were the Irish side of the family, who included her granddaughter Laura Sheeran, who like her cousin Ed, is also a singer \u2013 in her case for an \u2018alien synth pop band\u2019 called Nanu Nanu.Joining Matthew and Laura Sheeran as pall-bearers were other grandchildren Murray and Rory Cummings and Bridget Sheeran.",
        "After the final commendation, Nancy was borne from the church to the strains of the \u2018Hawk of Ballyshannon\u2019, as a single bell pealed above.As Father Byrne sprinkled holy water over the coffin, the family followed behind for the interment a few miles down the hillside.Earlier, the priest who conducted the service said Mrs Sheeran will be missed by the entire community where she lived.Father Felix Byrne, 93, told MailOnline: \u2018Anne was a lovely woman and her late husband was a gentleman.\u2018They lived just down the road from here on a farm, but sold off a lot of the land after they retired.\u2018Anne was involved in all the community\u2019s activities, organising all kinds of groups attached to the church and the village. We will all miss her dearly, it\u2019s a great loss.\u2018I know her grandson Ed was over to see her quite a lot but I only met him once, about 15 years ago.\u2018Anne was helping me organise a service to bless all the animals in the parish \u2013 people\u2019s dogs and cats and what have you. Ed came along to that, and I found him a nice chap to deal with.\u2018Everyone around here knows the lovely story of how William melted down gold from a dentist\u2019s surgery and made Anne a wedding ring.\u2019",
        "Ed Sheeran himself recalled the inspiration for his song Nancy Mulligan, a few years ago.They were married in Wexford and Ed said \u2018nobody turned up at their wedding,\u2019 he said.\u2018My grandfather stole all the gold teeth in his dental surgery and melted them down into a wedding ring.\u2018They wore borrowed clothes to get married, and just basically had this kind of Romeo and Juliet romance, which is like the most romantic thing.\u2018So I thought I'd write a song about it and make it a jig,\u2019 Ed said.The singer\u2019s grandparents subsequently went on to have eight children and 23 grandchildren.When the song went public, a touching video emerged of Nancy listening to it for the first time back in 2017.She even made an appearance on RTE News where she spoke at length about her gifted grandchild.\u2018I will never think of him as being famous, I have to say. He\u2019s exactly the same as he always is when he visits.\u2018And it\u2019s very rare because he\u2019s always working and when you think he was working from the age of 14, you\u2019d have to feel sorry for him, you know he\u2019s so tired but he loves it,\u2019 Nancy said.Last night, the singer\u00a0sported a laid-back look while attending the premiere of his Disney+ documentary series in New York.\u00a0",
        "Ed\u00a0wore a black leather jacket over a white T-shirt, black jeans and Nike sneakers for the screening, where guests were treated to his docuseries, 'Ed Sheeran: The Sum of It All.'He also\u00a0rocked his usual scruffy beard and wore his ginger hair in a tousled bedhead style with a choppy fringe.After originally believing his four-part documentary series would follow him in the studio and writing music, the challenges in Ed's life - particularly in February 2022 - saw the show turn into a therapeutic experience, where he bares his soul to his enormous fanbase.\u00a0The series features a personal behind-the-scenes look at\u00a0Sheeran's life, including a heartbreaking moment of him crying as he recalled finding out about his wife\u00a0Cherry Seaborn's\u00a0cancer diagnosis."
