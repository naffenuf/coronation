        "Hitman Mark Fellows, 42, dubbed The Iceman, was stabbed in HMP WakefieldA 'gun for hire' who was jailed after carrying out a gangland assassination has been stabbed in the head and neck in prison.",
        "Mark Fellows, 42, dubbed The Iceman, was attacked for a second time at the maximum security HMP Wakefield on Saturday.The double murderer was treated by prison medics. He was left with a scar after a similar attack in 2019.Fellows was the hitman contracted in 2015 to take out a leading figure in a rival gang, Paul Massey, 55, using an Uzi sub-machine gun.Dressed in army fatigues, he peppered Massey with shots and then pursued his target up the driveway of his home in Clifton, Salford, to finish him off.\u00a0",
        "Known as Salford's 'Mr Big', Massey was one the city's most notorious and feared figures but he died on his own doorstep.Three years later, Fellows murdered Massey's associate from Liverpool, John 'Scouse' Kinsella, 53. The hitman cycled up to his target near the village of Rainhill in Merseyside as his target walked his dogs. The assassin shot him twice in the back and then calmly approached his stricken victim to shoot him twice more in the back of the head.Fellows was handed a rare whole-life term in January 2019 following 26-day trial which ended with him being convicted of two counts of murder.Jailing him, Mr Justice William Davis said: 'So far as is known you had no personal animus in relation to Paul Massey.",
        "'The only sensible conclusion is that you were a gun for hire prepared to kill whoever you were asked to kill by those who hired you.'He was handed a 'whole life' term, which means he cannot apply for parole and will probably die in prison. Just two weeks after he shot dead Massey, Fellows was shot in the backside outside his grandmother's house.Mark Fellows in the Great Manchester Run, 2015. The data from his Garmin watch help to convict him of Paul Massey's murder",
        "Just a month after he was jailed, Fellows was attacked with a razor blade inside HMP Whitemoor in Cambridgeshire. He ostentatiously stroked the scar he was left with when he appeared in court later in 2019 in an unsuccessful bid to challenge his whole life tariff.It is understood the latest attack on Fellows happened at HMP Wakefield in Saturday as the country was celebrating the coronation of King Charles.Local media learned he was stabbed to the back of his head and neck in the prison grounds. He wasn't in his cell.His injuries were not serious and he was treated by prison medics. He was not taken to hospital. An investigation into the attack is underway.A Prison Service spokesperson said: 'We have a zero tolerance approach to violence and will always take strong action against those who break these rules.'"
