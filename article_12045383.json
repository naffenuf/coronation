Its shares are up 12% so far this year.In Next's first quarter, store sales fell 0.6%, online sales were down 1.6%, while finance interest income rose 7.4%.Next's statement made no comment on default rates in its credit business.On Wednesday, British bank Lloyds reported early signs of stress among some borrowers.
