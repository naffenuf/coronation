        "The UK has agreed a multimillion-pound partnership with Rwanda designed to tackle the number of small boats of migrants coming to Britain via unauthorised routes.The \u00a3140 million deal will see some migrants who enter unlawfully via the English Channel sent to Kigali, if they cannot be deported back to their home country.Opening the discussions in No 10\u2019s pillared room, Mr Sunak said: \u201cRwanda and the UK are great friends and we have demonstrated that with our migration and economic partnership, which I think shows us leading the way in finding global solutions for shared international challenges.\u201dThe Conservative Party leader also praised Mr Kagame\u2019s role as chair-in-office of the Commonwealth over the past year, saying he had \u201cled the way\u201d on issues such as trade and sustainability.

Instead of pushing for much-needed human rights change in Rwanda, UK politicians from Rishi Sunak down are busily praising the Rwandan authorities and minimising the seriousness of the human rights situation in the country  Steve Valdez-Symonds, Amnesty International  A No 10 spokeswoman added: \u201cDiscussing the UK and Rwanda\u2019s migration and economic development partnership, the Prime Minister updated on the court process and reiterated his commitment to operationalise the policy and begin flights to Rwanda at the earliest opportunity.\u201dThe leaders also spoke about international security challenges, including in Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Ukraine, the readout said.",
        "Human rights charity Amnesty International said Mr Sunak should have used the talks to \u201cformally cancel the dreadful refugees deal\u201d.Refugee and migrant rights director Steve Valdez-Symonds said: \u201cOne of the many deeply regrettable things about the Rwanda refugee deal is that it\u2019s provided Kagame\u2019s authoritarian government with political cover from the UK.\u201cInstead of pushing for much-needed human rights change in Rwanda, UK politicians from Rishi Sunak down are busily praising the Rwandan authorities and minimising the seriousness of the human rights situation in the country.\u201d",
        "The British leader also spoke to the prime minister of Spain, Pedro Sanchez, over the phone on Thursday.According to Downing Street, the pair \u201cwelcomed the strong and growing economic, security and cultural ties between the UK and Spain, as well as wider co-operation with European partners\u201d.The No 10 spokesman added: \u201cOn Gibraltar, the leaders agreed on the importance of progressing negotiations on a UK-EU treaty and concluding a suitable agreement as soon as possible.\u201cThey also discussed the situation in Ukraine and reaffirmed the UK and Spain\u2019s enduring support for Ukraine\u2019s defence against Russia\u2019s illegal invasion and president Zelensky\u2019s plan for peace.\u201dMr Sunak is expected to meet with more leaders on Friday."
