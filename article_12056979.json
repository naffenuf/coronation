        "Miami Grand Prix bosses are in talks with Formula One about staging the race at night.",
        "The event which runs round the Hard Rock Stadium \u2013 home of NFL\u2019s Miami Dolphins \u2013 joined the calendar last season on a 10-year deal.Sunday\u2019s race is the first of three to be staged in the United States this year, with a debut event on the Las Vegas strip in November, while Austin\u2019s grand prix at the Circuit of the Americas has been a permanent fixture on the F1 schedule since 2012.The round in Vegas will take place under lights, and Miami Dolphins chief executive Tom Garfinkel revealed on Sunday that his race could transform to a night event.\u201cWe have had some discussions about a night race and potentially doing that and what it would look like,\u201d said Garfinkel.\u201cThere are a lot of factors that go into that with F1 and television so we have to weigh all those things up, but we are certainly open-minded.\u201d",
        "The race in Florida is set to be sprinkled with stardust. Twitter and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, actor Vin Diesel, singer Shakira, former Manchester City forward Sergio Aguero, influencer-boxer Jake Paul, former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson, and tennis greats Serena Williams and Roger Federer are just some of the names on Sunday\u2019s glitzy guestlist.\u201cThe celebrity attendance is pretty remarkable,\u201d added Garfinkel. \u201cIt shows the relevance of Formula One and how popular the sport is right now.",
        "\u201cThe sort of wealth, CEO and celebrity factor, is like nothing I have ever seen at another sporting event.\u201d"
