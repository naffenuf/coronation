        "He filmed\u00a0his feature episode back in July 2022 in Manchester, however it wasn't televised until Saturday April 29.He said: 'For the last nine months, my family had thought I\u2019d taken the \u00a310,000 because I wouldn\u2019t have been able to keep a whole secret. On Saturday, we all watched it together and when I said I would take on the question they were just going nuts.'As huge fans of the game show, Daniel's parents were elated to see their son on the big screen, especially as it was his mum's idea to apply for the show.He added that he initially had no intention of going on the show, but a surprise call back from producers settled his nerves.",
        "Daniel said he\u00a0really liked the format of the show and it's 'logic-based working out of things' but did concede that he almost succumbed to the live pressure.He said: 'I didn\u2019t know how I was going to do it. You only have 30 seconds on each question, but I just got my head in it for those 30 seconds. I remember on the day, my mum and dad both called me for half an hour separately and quizzed me, which was my revision.'He was adamant that he'd answered a few questions incorrectly, but kept his head in the game and stood strong until the end.\u00a0\u00a0",
        "The lad has sure made his family proud, after offering to take them to a number of festivals this year - with a promise to foot the costs.Daniel has also become somewhat of a neighbourhood hero, and is taken aback by the outpouring of support and positivity from the local community.He said the experience has been an incredible one, and everyone he met on the show was 'kind and lovely'."
