        "The Eta Aquariid meteor shower was forecast to peak from midnight until dawnIt is caused by Planet Earth passing through dust left by Halley's CometWhile the weather might not be on side, at least the stars have put on a show for the Coronation.\u00a0",
        "In what some may herald as a good omen, a meteor shower lit up the skies early this morning ahead of King Charles\u2019s big day.\u00a0The Eta Aquariid meteor shower was forecast to peak \u2013 with up to 50 meteors per hour \u2013 from midnight until dawn.\u00a0It will continue until May 28. It is caused by the Earth passing through dust left over from Halley\u2019s Comet, which is visible from Earth only every 76 years.\u00a0Fittingly, Halley\u2019s Comet is depicted in the Bayeux Tapestry, which tells the story of the Norman Conquest by William the Conqueror \u2013 Charles\u2019s ancestor who was crowned in 1066.",
        "Meteors are pieces of debris, sometimes as small as a grain of sand, that enter Earth\u2019s atmosphere at speeds of up to 70 kilometres per second, vaporising and causing the streaks of light that delight skygazers.The meteor show favoured the Southern Hemisphere and appeared low in the sky for northerly latitudes, such as the UK, in the early predawn hours.According to the Greeks and Romans, the arrival of comets, meteors and meteor showers were signs that something good or bad had happened or was about to happen.In Ancient Greece, an astronomer named Ptolemy claimed that shooting stars would occur when the gods opened up the sky to watch the humans below."
