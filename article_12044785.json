        "'He forcibly kissed me out of nowhere,' she told The Star.

'Like you're a child and he was trying to say \"we should be a power couple,\" and I'm like \"clearly you're out of your mind right now.'''A lawyer for Mahomes, Brandan Davies denied the allegations at the time.'Jackson has done nothing wrong,' the attorney told the outlet. 'Our investigation has revealed substantial evidence refuting the claims of Jackson's accuser including the statements of several witnesses.'We have reached out to law enforcement to provide the fruit of our investigation so that they may have a complete picture of the matter.'",
        "The younger Mahomes has been in the spotlight for viral behavior on TikTok, but has also stirred up some controversy with his antics on the sidelines at his brother's games.\u00a0In 2021, he poured water on a Baltimore Ravens fan after a Chiefs loss in an incident that was caught on video.

        "Mahomes quietly made a return to social media\u00a0last week almost two months after being accused of assault and sexual assault.Mahomes, who has a big following on TikTok and Instagram, had been unusually quiet across social media platforms in the weeks following the allegations but began posting again last week.\u00a0Last Wednesday, he posted on his Instagram story appearing to be mingling with NFL fans who came into Kansas City for the NFL Draft.He also made his first TikTok in about two months as he lip-synced the lyrics, 'I've been losing friends and finding peace.'He also posted a photo of him beaming alongside his brother Patrick to his profile on Saturday."
