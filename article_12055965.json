        "Warning - graphic language in below video.\u00a0O'Malley - 16-1 after beating Petr Yan in October and now the UFC's No 2 contender after\u00a0Merab Dvalishvili - said: 'You better hope you look better than tonight. You better hope you look better than that! You better be ready to cut weight, baby.'Sterling responded: 'You've had a whole year to work on your jiu-jitsu. Now Daddy Dana (White, UFC chief) ain't gonna babysit that a** no more.\u00a0Before O'Malley added: 'You better be ready to go again. Soon, real soon. Get ready to cut weight real soon, baby. You'd better look better than that, b****. You better look better than that.'At the same time, the New Yorker continued: 'Get your a** in the big boy players, baby,' as the pair squared up, talked over each other and shouted in each other's faces before White stepped in to separate the duo.",
        "After O'Malley insisted 'You looked like s**t', Sterling questioned why he 'ran' by turning down the title shot, continuing: 'That's what I thought.\u00a0'Because I'd drag your a** up and down this octagon. Get the f*** out my cage. Get this piece of s*** out of my cage.'\u00a0Cejudo's grand plan of a bold attempt to move up and challenge Alexander Volkanovski\u00a0at featherweight have been scuppered at the first hurdle, and he suggested he'll call it a day again.\u00a0Triple C knew he needed a huge fifth round and it was his most convincing five minutes. He pushed the pace, won the exchanges and dominated but it proved to be too little, too late for two of the judges."
