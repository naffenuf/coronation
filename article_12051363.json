        "Terry, who became the newest member of the Foxes coaching staff last month, was taking part in a passing drill when he attempted to reach a rather wayward ball from Jamie Vardy.The 42-year-old overstretched himself and proceeded to tumble over, prompting rapturous laughter from the players taking part.Maddison was particularly amused as he made sure everyone appreciated what had just happened.Leicester shared the video on their Instagram page and Terry quickly responded\u00a0saying: 'I would have got that 5 years ago.'Scroll down for video\u00a0",
        "Maddison wasn't done yet, however, as he shared a picture of Terry falling to his Instagram story with the caption: 'You okay pal @johnterry.26.'Terry shared it and placed the blame on Vardy, saying he 'wiped me out in the circle'.The former Chelsea and England captain is now working with Dean Smith and fellow first team coach Craig Shakespeare.\u00a0He had worked on a consultancy basis at Chelsea as a coach but has rejoined the pair he worked with at Aston Villa.",
