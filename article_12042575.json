        "While she had a security clearance during her time working in the Obama-Biden administration, Chung told lawmakers that she believed that any classified material or documents that would need to be collected via the President Records Act had been removed from Biden's office by the time she was packing it up.\u00a0She testified that she didn't double check the contents as she loaded file folders into the approximately 13 boxes that ended up at the Penn Biden Center.\u00a0When asked why she said, 'we didn\u2019t have the time or we didn\u2019t think that we needed to sort through them.'\u00a0'We just were tasked with \u2013 to pack up,' she added, according to CNN.\u00a0In her interview with lawmakers, she explained that some of Biden's belongings were unpacked, while other files were stowed away.'Well, there were - like those boxes with the Cancer Moonshot and some of the policy papers, I knew. You know, we unpacked those,' she said.
