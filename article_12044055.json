        "Household brands are among the names on a 150-strong letter to the ChancellorJeremy Hunt\u2019s refusal to re-introduce the scheme described\u00a0as an 'own goal'\u00a0\u00a0The King\u2019s tailor and the UK\u2019s oldest family jeweller last night warned that the controversial tourist tax is discouraging investment in the UK.",
        "Business leaders said the absence of a VAT-free shopping scheme for holidaymakers was not only deterring shoppers from spending money but influencing retailers to shun the UK too.Household brands including Burberry and Harrods are among names on a 150-strong letter to Chancellor Jeremy Hunt, organised by hotelier Sir Rocco Forte, arguing the move is an own goal for Britain.The Mail\u2019s Scrap The Tourist Tax campaign \u2013 urging the Government to bring back tax-free shopping \u2013 has also been backed by MPs from across the parties.Anda Rowland, who heads the Royal suitmaker Anderson &amp; Sheppard in Savile Row, said the tax was one of several challenges for European businesses setting up shop in the UK and she would \u2018certainly think twice\u2019 about coming to London if in their shoes.",
        "She described Chancellor Jeremy Hunt\u2019s refusal to re-introduce the scheme, ditched after Brexit, as an \u2018own goal\u2019 that could drive businesses, as well as wealthy shoppers, to Paris and Milan.Last week, footfall in the West End \u2013 including in Oxford St and Bond St \u2013 was down 23 per cent compared to the same week in 2019. Dee Corsi, boss of the New West End Company, which shared the figures, said a Covid recovery was being held back by the tax.",
        "Although international visitors were slowly returning to London, they were hesitant to go on shopping sprees to the same extent, she said, adding: \u2018The harmful impact of this tourist tax is being amplified as international visitors return in greater numbers.\u2019\u00a0Peggy Porschen said she would consider expanding her cake cafe business in countries other than Britain.She said she \u2018always imagined strengthening our foothold here\u2019 but there were \u2018too many challenges to further entertain this plan\u2019, including a dramatic drop in both European and Asian customers since the tax was scrapped.And Henry Deakin, who runs Britain\u2019s oldest family jeweller Deakin &amp; Francis, told The Mail: \u2018If I was a tourist, doing a world-wide tour, I\u2019d hold back\u2019 on splurging in the UK.",
        "He said he would \u2018100 per cent\u2019 consider opening a store in Paris over London. \u2018I certainly wouldn\u2019t want to lose my Mayfair store, but I wouldn\u2019t think about opening a second UK one.\u2019Their remarks come as John Dickie, chief executive of industry group BusinessLDN, writes in today\u2019s Mail that the Coronation will be a missed opportunity because tourists will be deterred from spending by the VAT levy.The Treasury claims that reinstating tax-free shopping would cost the nation \u00a32billion a year, but research suggests there would be a net annual gain of around \u00a3350million because of the knock-on benefits.",
        "Coronation is missed chance to make most of visitor boomBy John Dickie\u00a0\u00a0ANALYSIS\u00a0This weekend the UK will host a spectacle that will be watched by millions across the globe \u2013 the King\u2019s Coronation. It is the first time in 70 years that people have had the chance to see history being made in the capital.That\u2019s why visitors from the UK and beyond will descend on London to soak up the atmosphere.The Coronation will provide a much-needed boost for London\u2019s leisure, hospitality and retail businesses badly hit by the pandemic.\u00a0However, despite the scale of the occasion, we are not doing everything we should to attract high-spending visitors to this event or to maximise the capital\u2019s attractiveness to overseas tourism, which, in turn, will support jobs and growth.In 2019, according to Visit Britain, tourism in England contributed \u00a3106billion to the British economy and supported 2.6million jobs.",
        "After Brexit, the Government inexplicably decided to stop overseas visitors from being able to reclaim VAT on goods purchased here and then taken home. This puts us at an enormous disadvantage to the EU.American, Chinese, Indian and other visitors to continental European countries can claim back VAT when they leave. As can we Brits. But no visitors to the UK can.We are seriously losing out as a result. Figures from Global Blue show that 10 per cent of UK spending by international shoppers in 2019 has now moved to EU countries, which have kept VAT-free shopping.",
        "We are also lagging behind other European cities in attracting visitors from key markets. For example, spending by American shoppers in the UK is now back at 2019 levels, a welcome recovery from the dark days of the pandemic.\u00a0But our figure lags starkly behind France, Spain and Italy, which have virtually doubled their American spending. This is an issue that matters for the whole of the UK\u2019s flatlining economy.A week after the Coronation, Liverpool will host the music industry\u2019s biggest night \u2013 the Eurovision Song Contest. The event is predicted to be worth around \u00a325million to the regional economy.Events like this in the UK would attract even more international visitors that would help turbocharge our economy if we brought back VAT-free shopping.\u00a0By doing so, it would strongly support growth, generate \u00a34.1billion gross added value annually, and create 78,000 jobs, according to Oxford Economics.Re-introducing the scheme would boost spending from visitors and more than compensate for the short-term loss of VAT receipts \u2013 delivering an extra \u00a3350million in tax revenues for the Exchequer every year.\u00a0This would ultimately be a win-win for business, the economy and the country.Britain is competing in the global race for tourism with our shoelaces tied together.We must act now to restore VAT-free shopping so, for example, we are an attractive hop across the Channel for visitors to the Olympics in Paris next summer.",
        "The Government missed a trick by failing to seize the opportunity to bring back VAT-free shopping for international visitors ahead of the Coronation.\u00a0We need to act now to show the world that Britain is open for business.John Dickie is the chief executive of BusinessLDN"
