        "Tottenham interim boss Ryan Mason believes there are still elements of Harry Kane\u2019s contribution to the team that go underappreciated.",
        "The stadium announcer was still in the midst of declaring one minute of first-half added time when Kane connected with Pedro Porro\u2019s whipped cross and nodded in the eventual winner as Tottenham beat Crystal Palace 1-0.Kane\u2019s strike, his 209th in the Premier League, also moved him ahead of Wayne Rooney and into outright second on the all-time top scorer list.",
        "Mason said: \u201cNaturally we\u2019ll all talk about Harry\u2019s goals and Harry when he plays games of football he will continue to score goals. We know that.\u201cBut also that elite mindset, that example that he sets every day in and around the place, it\u2019s great to be around. Because when you have people like that they inspire you to be better and we appreciate Harry, we value him so much at this football club.\u201dThe England captain\u2019s 28th goal in all competitions this season leaves him 51 behind all-time Premier League leader Alan Shearer, who netted 260 in the top flight.",
        "Alan Shearer (260)Harry Kane (209)Wayne Rooney (208)Andrew Cole (187)Sergio Aguero (184)",
        "\u201cHarry is certainly one player that is focused every game to be the best version of himself every time he is out on that football pitch, whether it\u2019s the training ground or on matchday, so hopefully Harry continues to play and I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll continue to score goals.\u201d Mason remained pragmatic when asked if Kane was set to break that mark, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t really like speaking too much about the future because from personal experience I know that you can\u2019t really plan too much far ahead in football terms and in life, and you\u2019ve got to be in the moment.",
        "Saturday\u2019s victory was a subdued affair but enough to secure Mason a first victory in his second spell in charge of Spurs.",
        "Roy Hodgson\u2019s Palace, meanwhile, had a handful of chances and were kept in it by several good saves from Sam Johnstone, who has in recent weeks usurped Vicente Guaita as his boss\u2019 first-choice keeper.The former England manager was more forthcoming about 29-year-old Kane\u2019s chances at surpassing Shearer, saying: \u201cI would expect it, you know his age, he\u2019s got several good years ahead of him and he doesn\u2019t get injured very often, touch wood.\u201cI think the only thing that stands between him and the record will be is he going to avoid serious injury? Is he going to be able to get 20, 30 matches a year behind him? Is he going to get help from his team-mates and play in a good team which is what he has been playing in?",
        "\u201cIf all those things take place I expect him to break the record, absolutely.\u201dHodgson departed from Mason when asked if Kane was to some degree still viewed as an underrated talent.He added: \u201cYou\u2019re talking maybe for a body of football fans and football people that I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know who they are, I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re saying, but I can guarantee that none of us that work in football on a serious basis in what I call the football village, there\u2019s none of us that have that opinion.\u201d"
