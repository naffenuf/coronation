        "Just when everyone thought The Crown was coming to an end, Netflix insiders have let slip that there may yet be another series of the hit Royal drama to come.",
        "Officially, the streaming platform has always insisted that the sixth season, expected to air this autumn, will be the last, taking events up to the late Queen\u2019s death last year.But at a recent wrap party to mark the end of filming those episodes, producers revealed to The Mail on Sunday that an extra series could be on the cards. With a wink, one executive hinted: \u2018Just you wait until next year \u2013 maybe we will be in production.\u2019The big-budget series, which has charted the late Queen\u2019s life since her 1947 wedding to Prince Philip, has become more controversial as the events it dramatises \u2013 often with only a loose connection to the truth \u2013 become more contemporary. So if a seventh series covered King Charles\u2019s reign, it could make more headlines.Another possibility would be a prequel, focusing on the late Queen\u2019s childhood and teenage years.",
        "The last scenes of series six to be shot recreated the 2005 wedding of Charles and Camilla, played by Dominic West and Olivia Williams.Last month, WestS, 53, was visibly emotional as filming wound up in Rochester, Kent, which was standing in for Windsor. But the day ended in celebratory mood, with cast and crew dancing to a live band.West was also the last man standing at the wrap party, leaving the bash at the Natural History Museum at 3.30am. Others there included Imelda Staunton, who plays the Queen, and Jonathan Pryce, who plays Philip. Olivia Colman and Claire Foy played younger versions of Her Majesty in previous series."
