        "A performance of You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone at the Coronation Concert has amused some Twitter users, who saw it as a cheeky response to Liverpool fans who booed the national anthem on the day of the King\u2019s coronation.",
        "Thousands of people travelled to Windsor to attend the concert on Sunday, with the King and Queen sitting in the royal box to applaud the performers.",
        "One act in particular garnered a lot of reaction from amused Twitter users \u2013 Andrea Bocelli and Sir Bryn Terfel\u2019s performance of You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone.The song has a close link to Liverpool fans, who on Saturday \u2013 the day of the coronation \u2013 booed the national anthem before their team played Brentford in the Premier League.When the first notes of God Save The King began to play as both teams lined up around the centre circle, many supporters at Anfield voiced their opposition, before the Kop broke into chants of \u201cLiverpool\u201d.Many Twitter users posted pictures of Charles laughing to compliment their words, suggesting that the King chose the song as a tongue-in-cheek reaction to the football fans.",
        "\u201cNot them singing you\u2019ll never walk alone after the Scousers booed the national anthem\u201d, said one woman, alongside two images of Charles in hysterics.\u201cSinging you\u2019ll never walk alone at the #CoronationConcert oh the Liverpool and Celtic fans will love this\u201d, said another.Another user wrote: \u201cI won\u2019t lie. It is hilarious Andrea Bocelli singing you\u2019ll never walk alone at the kings concert the day after we booed the anthem.\u201d"
