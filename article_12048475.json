        "Polls in England have closed with Rishi Sunak\u2019s Tories braced for a tough night after local contests which have been marred by complications due to new photo ID requirements.",
        "Campaigners have reported \u201ccountless examples\u201d of would-be voters being turned away from polling stations on the first English elections where photo identification is mandatory.The Electoral Reform Society, which has strongly opposed the introduction, urged ministers to rethink the new law as voters went to the polls in the local elections in England on Thursday.",
        "But the Association of Electoral Administrators said the polls had been \u201crunning as smoothly as usual\u201d.The Prime Minister has already conceded it will be a \u201chard night\u201d for the Tories but insisted they were moving away from \u201cbox set drama\u201d politics after the scandal-prone tenure of Boris Johnson and the chaotic collapse of the Liz Truss administration.A Tory spokesman said: \u201cThis will be a tough night for the Conservatives. Any Government which has been in power for 13 years is highly likely to lose seats.\u201dThe Conservatives have sought to manage expectations by pointing to forecasts by academic experts Professors Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher which suggest they could lose more than a thousand seats if things go badly.The Tories will seek to portray any defeat below that scale as better than expected \u2013 although the loss of hundreds of councillors would not bode well for Mr Sunak\u2019s hopes in the general election expected in 2024.",
        "The Tory spokesman said: \u201cIndependent experts Rallings and Thrasher have said we could lose over 1,000 seats.\u201cBut if Labour want to be in with a chance of taking office after the next general election as they did in 1997, they need to be making very significant gains as they did in 1995 \u2013 the last most comparable election \u2013 anything less than that will pose serious questions for Labour HQ.\u201dThe analysis by professors Rallings and Thrasher suggested gains of more than 700 for Labour would represent Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s party\u2019s best performance for at least a decade, which could put them on the path to becoming the largest party at a general election \u2013 even if short of an overall majority in the Commons.But 250 gains or fewer would be disappointing, while under 150 extra councillors would be \u201ceffectively a step backwards\u201d, the academics said.Shabana Mahmood MP, Labour\u2019s national campaign co-ordinator,\u00a0said: \u201cWe are proud of the positive campaign we have run, focused on the issues that matter most to voters.\u201cThis is a cost-of-living election. We have set out the choices we would make to help people through the cost-of-living crisis, cut crime and cut NHS waiting lists, but the Tories have been silent on the issues that matter most.",
        "\u201cIf the Conservatives go backwards from their disastrous 2019 local election results, the voters will have sent a damning message about Rishi Sunak\u2019s leadership.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long night and the full picture of results will not form until well into Friday afternoon but we expect to make gains and show we\u2019re making the progress in the places we need to win at the next election.\u201dLiberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said: \u201cI have knocked on countless doors in recent weeks and heard real anger and frustration from voters who are sick and tired of being taken for granted by this Conservative government. Tonight, their voices will be heard.\u201cI want to take this opportunity to thank Liberal Democrat councillors, candidates and volunteers who work tirelessly for their communities. They are true local champions who stand up for their local areas, and have done the party\u00a0proud.\u201dThe council and mayoral elections are the first time in England that identification from a defined list has been mandatory to cast a vote.Labour is among those criticising the Government\u2019s move, warning that it could lock millions out of voting.Jess Garland, the Electoral Reform Society\u2019s director of policy and research, said: \u201cWe\u2019re already seeing countless examples of people being denied their right to vote due to these new laws.",
        "\u201cFrom people caught out by having the wrong type of photo ID to others turned away for not looking enough like their photo.\u201cOne voter turned away is one voter too many. The Government must take lessons from the problems we\u2019re seeing today at polling stations across the country and face up to the fact that these new rules damage our elections more than they protect them.\u201dIn the early afternoon, the Association of Electoral Administrators said that no major problems had been reported, though it would likely not hear about individual voters being turned away.Chief executive Peter Stanyon said: \u201cPolling day appears to be running as smoothly as usual, which is testament to the months of planning and hard work from returning officers and electoral administrators running today\u2019s elections.\u201cWe hope the rest of the day continues along the same lines.\u201dLayla Moran, the Lib Dem MP for Oxford West and Abingdon, said she had been told of issues in her constituency.\u201cWe\u2019ve had reports by our tellers of people being turned away at polling stations for lack of correct ID,\u201d she said.\u201cAcross the country I\u2019m worried this will be significant numbers and far more than the exactly zero people found guilty of fraud last year.\u201dConservative MP for Southend West, Anna Firth, said she had to go back to the car to retrieve her ID so she could vote as she reminded people not to forget their documentation.",
        "The Electoral Commission, which was given \u00a35.6 million to carry out a public awareness campaign, has tasked councils with recording how many would-be voters are turned away.",
        "No record will be made if greeters deployed outside polling stations turn people away.The watchdog plans to publish its initial findings into how the ID mandate affected voting in the coming weeks.The Government has estimated that about 4% of Britain\u2019s population \u2013 or two million people \u2013 were unlikely to have a valid form of photo ID to vote.Passports, driving licences and blue badges are among the IDs permitted, as are the free certificates that could be applied for ahead of the vote.Photo ID will be required in England during future general elections under the policy.On Thursday, more than 8,000 council seats were being contested across 230 local authorities, while mayors were being selected in Bedford, Leicester, Mansfield and Middlesbrough.No votes were taking place in London and Birmingham, along with other areas including Cornwall, North Yorkshire and Cumbria.The last time the same council seats were contested was in May 2019, when the Tories performed poorly under Theresa May as she struggled with Brexit.The Conservatives lost more than 1,300 council seats and majority political control of 44 councils, meaning they had less to lose on Thursday than they might have done.",
        "About a quarter of the votes are expected to be counted overnight, with the rest counted during the day on Friday."
