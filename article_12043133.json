        "Royal enthusiasts often go to great lengths and travel long distances to make sure they get the best view of major ceremonial events at Buckingham Palace.",
        "But not many will have made a decision like 34-year-old Bartley Graham, who arrived at The Mall on Wednesday after discharging himself from hospital.He has joined dozens of people gathered in front of the Palace ahead of the King\u2019s coronation, with tents set up to enable them to get a prime spot.",
        "Mr Graham, from County Durham, said: \u201cI should have been here earlier, but the hospital scenario made it impossible.\u201cI self-discharged this morning purely so I could be here.\u201cIt\u2019s important I\u2019m here to get a good view of the procession, as I did for the Jubilee.",
        "\u201cI came out for Prince Phillip\u2019s funeral even though there was a risk I might be fined at the time.\u201cI queued for 30 hours at Balmoral to see the Queen\u2019s coffin a first time, and I queued 30 hours a second time at the Houses of Parliament.",
        "\u201cThen I passed out and had a stroke, and all I could blame was exhaustion.\u201cIf it happens again, I\u2019m in the right place, London\u2019s hospitals are the best in the country.\u201cI love being out here.\u201dMr Graham came wearing a suit printed with Union Jacks and carrying a cardboard cut-out of Charles, who he thinks will be \u201ca fantastic King\u201d.\u201cI like King Charles, and I definitely like Lady Camilla,\u201d he said.",
        "\u201cCharles will be a fantastic King and will do a great job, he has some really strong values, and I think Lady Camilla has fallen into the role very well.\u201dKerry Evans, 58, from Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, who also arrived at The Mall on Thursday said she \u201cwould rather die\u201d than miss the King\u2019s Coronation.\u201cI can\u2019t camp out like I used to, I\u2019ve got a heart condition and small vessel disease,\u201d she said.\u201cEvery time I come out to an event like this I end up in casualty, because I just exhaust myself, but I\u2019ve really paced myself this time.\u201cNothing would stop me, I would rather die supporting the Royal Family than not be part of all this,\u201d she continued.\u201cI\u2019ll probably suffer for three or four months after an event like this.\u201d",
        "Ms Evans, who is a writer and a full-time carer, says that she hopes the King will be a champion for diversity.\u201cThe King is being very quiet at the minute, I think he\u2019s waiting to see what people want,\u201d she said.\u201cI hope he\u2019ll be a strong King in terms of change and diversity, race, disability.\u201dOther fans of the Royal Family have travelled from further afield to see the coronation.Carol Bush, 62, who comes from California but now lives in London, and Ardis Ryburg, 61, from Arkansas, came out to The Mall together \u201cto support\u201d the late Queen.",
        "\u201cWe loved her, and she wanted her boy to do this, so we want to support her,\u201d Ms Bush said.\u201cThe Queen just gave and gave and gave, and really took her job as a monarch seriously.\u201cWe\u2019re going to come back in 20 years for her grandson, we\u2019ll be old in our wheelchairs and we\u2019ll be here for William,\u201d she continued.\u201cI can\u2019t wait for the carriage, I want to see the golden carriage come back out again.\u201d",
        "Celebrations for the King\u2019s coronation will take place over the course of this weekend.The ceremony itself will take place in Westminster Abbey on Saturday, with the Coronation Big Lunch and Coronation Concert happening on Sunday.Members of the public have been encouraged to take part in The Big Help Out on Bank Holiday Monday by volunteering for organisations in their local areas."
