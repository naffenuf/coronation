        "The boss of pharma giant GSK has confirmed the group is hunting for more acquisitions as it looks to boost its pipeline of new drugs.\u00a0",
        "On a call discussing the FTSE 100 firm\u2019s first quarter results, chief executive Emma Walmsley said the company had \u2018more in the hopper\u2019 as it scoped out new takeover targets.\u00a0The comments followed a swoop by the pharma firm earlier this month on Bellus Health in a deal that valued the Canadian drugmaker at \u00a31.6billion.\u00a0It was the largest takeover since GSK spun out its consumer health arm Haleon last summer as part of a strategy by Walmsley to focus on new and profitable medicines to treat cancer and other illnesses, after years of criticism about the company\u2019s performance.\u00a0The takeover of Bellus also followed the purchase last year of cancer drug maker Sierra Oncology and vaccine maker Affinivax for \u00a31.5billion and \u00a32.7billion respectively.\u00a0\u2018We are absolutely delighted with the deals we have announced in the last couple of months, we do intend to do more,\u2019 the chief executive said.\u00a0\u2018There is more in the hopper, but obviously we cannot share details on that.\u2019",
