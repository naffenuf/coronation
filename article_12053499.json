Then gradually it begins closing in, and it\u2019s a bit more formal, then suddenly it\u2019s like we\u2019ve stepped over the threshold into a mediaeval ceremony, something so extraordinary and uplifting, very religious, it was extraordinary.\u201d",

        "\u201cIt was very moving and the King looked vulnerable, which all monarchs do when they\u2019re being crowned. They\u2019re being encumbered with all these symbols and all this heavy cloak and this sceptre, the orb, the heavy crown, which means he can barely move.\u201cAnd in a strange way, I\u2019m sure not deliberately originally, but it\u2019s kind of symbolic of the encumbrances in life that you have if you\u2019re a monarch, so it\u2019s a very touching ceremony.\u201cHe\u2019s quite lonely somehow \u2013 as the queen was if you watch the 1953 coronation \u2013 but I feel very lucky to have been there.\u201d2.10pm More than 60 aircraft from the Royal Navy, British Army and Royal Air Force had been due to take part in the flypast at about 2.30pm.But the event will now only involve helicopters and the Red Arrows aerobatic display team, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said.The King and Queen are expected to watch the flypast from the balcony of Buckingham Palace.",
