        "Mack ran into Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes at the Kentucky Derby Saturday, and used it as a chance to joke about his own wagering misfortunes.Mack reportedly put $1million on the Texans to beat the Chiefs in the divisional round of the playoffs following the 2019 regular season.And despite Kansas City erasing a 24-0 deficit to win 51-31, Mack doubled down in the AFC Championship, wagering the same amount that the Titans would oust Mahomes.The Chiefs, winning 35-24, proved Mack wrong again and it's clear he still feels the financial pain Mahomes inflicted upon him.",
        "'You cost me millions betting against you,' Mack, whos real name is Jim McIngvale, told Mahomes as they shook hands.'I appreciate it. Sorry about that one,' Mahomes responded.'You gotta be with me next time.'McIngvale would get some payback the following season as he correctly predicted the Bucs to beat the Chiefs in the Super Bowl.He won $2.75million on that bet after wagering $3.46million.While Mack has endured some big losses at the hands of Mahomes and others, he won a record $75million on the Astros winning the 2022 World Series.\u00a0"
