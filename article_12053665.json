I didn't know what exclusive meant.'",
        "The podcast host said it's a very new relationship, and didn't reveal her new partner's name.\u00a0Despite appearing single since she broke up with Konrad last year, Abbie did confirm that something romantic happened between her and US rapper Yung Gravy when he was in the country.\u00a0Talking about rumours that they slept together, Abbie said in a sarcastic tone: 'I certainly didn't spend two nights at his hotel.\u00a0'Nothing happened, we just had Maccas.'\u00a0",
        "Abbie's relationship news comes weeks after she opened up about maybe being a lesbian.\u00a0\u00a0The radio host is bisexual, but last month questioned her sexuality as she likes to think about women while having sex with men.Speaking on her It's A Lot podcast, the 27-year-old asked: 'So I actually have not come just from feeling except for with women, I have to literally disassociate with men.",
        "'There is still sometimes a man involved in what I'm thinking about, but in my mind I am thinking about the woman and her enjoying the gang bang.'So, my question is, am I just gay?'",
        "Abbie then said that her friends who are lesbians said this is not a normal thing for a bisexual person to do, so she is probably gay.However, the podcast host then wondered if it's down to her ADHD.She added: 'I feel like also it could be an ADHD thing? Where your brain is trying to latch onto something else?'I bought a Cigarettes after Sex record to listen to during sex so that my brain is distracted but there's not many lyrics.'\u00a0"
