        "The 68-year-old Yellowstone star's absence was 'hard' for\u00a0Christine, 49, who wanted him to spend more time at their family home in Santa Barbara.'During filming, Kevin is not around very much. His absence has been very hard for her,' a source told People\u00a0on Monday.The insider added that though the Hollywood veteran was aware that\u00a0Christine was unhappy, her divorce filing after 18 years of marriage was still an 'unpleasant surprise.'\u00a0As\u00a0Costner's revived career continued to pick up more steam amid the popularity of Yellowstone, his wife was concerned about his new projects, including his upcoming Western epic, Horizon.\u00a0The epic final instalment of Yellowstone returns this November, only on Stan.\u00a0",

He has been in demand.''All of this success and excitement over the new project probably took his attention away from his family more than he realized. Since it didn't look like that would change and likely could get worse, it caused tension at home.'",
        "Costner was seen for the first time since his marital strife emerged as he hit the golf range last Tuesday\u00a0in St. George, just hours after news of his divorce surfaced.Kevin's wife Christine, whom he was been married to since 2004, filed for divorce last week, citing 'irreconcilable differences.'The couple have three children together: Cayden, 15, Hayes, 14, and Grace, 12.Costner was previously married to Cindy Silva from 1978 to 1994 and they share three children - Annie, 39, Lily, 36, and Joe, 35.

We ask to be allowed the dignity of sorting through this more painful part of our lives in private,' a statement from the couple read in 1994.\u00a0Costner and Silva met while they were both students at California State University - Fullerton.They would go on to have three children together.The pair split amid multiple reports that Costner had been having an affair with a celebrated hula dancer named Michele Amaral while he was filming his multi-million dollar flop Waterworld in Hawaii.Eventually, Silva was awarded around $80 million in the divorce settlement.In a 1995 interview, The Bodyguard star took responsibility for his role in the demise of his marriage, but did not go into detail.'A series of events conspired to happen at the same time. I know it hurt some people that I had failed in my marriage. And the marriage was my own failure,' he said.Costner said in a 1995 interview with Parade Magazine that he never even spoke to Amaral on the phone.He also listed off the other women he was supposedly linked to including Playboy model Angie Everheart and the daughter of casino magnate Steve Wynn.'It was hard on Cindy and our children. It didn't help things. The only thing it did was hurt. The collapse of my marriage was the hardest thing of all for me,' the Dances With Wolves star said.Costner went on to express his love for his first wife: 'You can put this on the record. Through all the pain, Cindy's been what I always thought she was a real lady. I still have love for Cindy.'Silva supported Costner when he was a struggling actor, taking on odd-jobs that included performing as Snow White at Disneyland.Short-lived fling Bridget Rooney",

        "Costner allegedly had an affair with a celebrated hula dancer named Michele Amaral while he was filming his multi-million dollar flop Waterworld in Hawaii.\u00a0Amaral was also married as well as being a mother-of-two when she met Costner.A report at the time in the New York Daily News said that the pair met at the Mauna Lani hotel and shortly afterwards Amaral was 'spotted creeping out of his $4,500-a-day villa.According to a Departures Magazine feature, Amaral has taught hula across the world and is known as the island's premier soloist.The Daily News report said that Silva was alerted to the affair by someone who was working on Waterworld and was fired.The same article accused Costner of multiple infidelities during his marriage.At the time Costner strenuously denied the allegations saying that he was merely interviewing Amaral for a job.During an interview where Amaral was brought up, Costner became infuriated.'This woman has done nothing wrong and yet has had to share the harsh light of celebrity with me. I feel embarrassed, and I don't think there's one thing I can do to make her life better.''This woman has a name and to make her a thing is the worst part of all. It's wrong for her and her husband,' Costner said.Second wife Christine Baumgartner\u00a0",
        "Costner and second wife\u00a0Baumgartner\u00a0first began dating in 1998, having met around 1996 while Costner was filming his movie Tin Cup.The Bodyguard star said that at the time he first met her, he wasn't ready to fall in love again.\u00a0Both are graduates of California State University - Fullerton. Baumgartner graduated with a degree in business.\u00a0They married in 2004 in Aspen, Colorado, where Costner has long maintained a 160-acre ranch, known as The Dunbar. Rooms can be rented on the property for as much as $36,000 per night.The reason for the long courtship was because Costner was not sure if wanted more kids. The uncertainty even led them to break up for a period prior to their engagement.'Fear kept me from marrying Christine. [She] wanted a child, but I was afraid I couldn't be an effective father.''I woke up and thought, 'Am I going to lose a beautiful woman who is willing to be with me to my very last breath because I am afraid to say yes to a child?' That's all it took. Sometimes you learn the thing you're most afraid of will save your life,' he told Closer Weekly in 2018.Costner told the Daily Telegraph in 2011 that the reason for his four year hiatus from making movies was because of his new family.As a recently as 2020, Costner spoke glowingly about how the couple's relationship strengthened during the Covid-19 pandemic. He told People: 'Our partnership has really come into focus about what we do for each other and how we deal with our family.'",
        "In 2022, Radar Online reported that Costner was given an ultimatum from his wife. The report said that she was demanding that he quit his hit show Yellowstone due to the fact that he was gone from home so often.'The show is such a mega-hit, producers want it to go on forever!
