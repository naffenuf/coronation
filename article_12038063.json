        "Amber Hill has admitted she will never get over the moment she discovered her dream of competing at the Tokyo Olympics had been dashed due to a positive test for coronavirus.",
        "The 23-year-old skeet shooter had her bags packed and had bade farewell to her family when she received the news just two days prior to the opening ceremony in the Japanese capital.All the stars had seemed to align for Hill, who was to have gone into her second Games as the reigning world number one and one of Team GB\u2019s strongest hopes to stand on top of the podium.Instead, she found herself isolating at home where her mental health deteriorated and she spent sleepless nights seriously considering quitting her sport.",
        "\u201cIt was one of the hardest moments of my life and it\u2019s something I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ll ever get over,\u201d Hill told the PA news agency.\u201cWhat I found really hard was that I was at the best point of my career, my training was perfect, and I was genuinely feeling as happy as I ever had.\u201cThe disappointment of not knowing how that Olympic journey was going to end for me was heartbreaking. I had resentment towards the sport, I was bitter towards it all. I\u2019d lie awake at night worrying about everything.",
        "\u201cI didn\u2019t realise at the time, but I was going through a traumatic experience. I got into a very dark place with it all and I was ready to quit.\u201d",
        "Hill, a precocious junior who became her sport\u2019s youngest winner of a World Cup series at the age of 15 in 2013 and had made her debut at the Rio Olympics, soon realised she required more than just the support of her family and friends to help her through.Working with a psychologist recommended to her by British Shooting, Hill learned to take a step back from the sport to which she had devoted most of her life since the age of eight, and began to prioritise her life away from the range.She married her long-term partner in February this year \u2013 something she admitted she would have previously struggled to schedule \u2013 and is also spending more time pursuing business interests that remain, for the time being, under wraps.Quietly, Hill\u2019s shooting career began to flourish again. In 2022, she won three medals at the World Championships in Osijek, European gold in Nicosia, World Cup golds in Nicosia and Changwon, and a trio of European golds in Larnaca.She said: \u201cI began to understand that as much as I believed that I was putting myself first, I really wasn\u2019t. Everything was put on hold because of my shooting schedule. I realised I had to start focusing on the things that make me happy in daily life.",
        "\u201cI wasn\u2019t in a great place with the sport, but I knew I had people who relied on me. I went to competitions with no expectations again, like I had when I first started competing, and that\u2019s where the success really came from.\u201cIt was totally unexpected, but last year was my most successful to date. I\u2019ve had some massive low points and I\u2019m surprised I\u2019ve managed to push through. But I feel like I have a much healthier relationship with my sport.\u201d",
        "Arguably the most significant of Hill\u2019s sporting achievements in 2022 was her European title in September that confirmed a quota place for Paris \u2013 meaning she has effectively spared herself the potential insecurity of qualifying going down to the wire for what will be her second Games.She is likely to go the French capital as a gold medal favourite but confesses to still struggling to come to terms with her gruelling ascent to the summit of her sport \u2013 and much better equipped should she come up short against those inevitable external expectations.\u201cRegardless of what the outcome is, I realise now that there is so much more to my sport than just a medal around my neck,\u201d Hill added.\u201cIt\u2019s got to fit in with what I want to do and what makes me happy. If the day comes when it doesn\u2019t, then it\u2019s clearly not for me any more.\u201d"
