        "Liam Gordon is adamant St Johnstone will not panic after being dragged back into a relegation battle.",
        "The Perth men looked comfortable just a couple of months ago as they chased a place in the top six while other teams near the bottom struggled for form.But after failing to win any of their last seven games, they go into the post-split fixtures having allowed 10th-placed Dundee United and 11th-placed Kilmarnock to close to within two points of them, while they are just six points clear of last-placed Ross County.Captain Gordon \u2013 whose side needed a relegation play-off to survive last term \u2013 is adamant he and his colleagues will not allow the renewed threat to their cinch Premiership status to spook them.\u201cIt\u2019s not rocked us at all,\u201d he said ahead of Saturday\u2019s showdown with United at McDiarmid Park. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously a position we didn\u2019t want to find ourselves in because of the position we were in (recently) but these things happen in football.\u201cWe had a couple of poor weeks and we find ourselves in this situation and it\u2019s up to ourselves to get out of it but I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019re rocked at all.",
        "\u201cWe know the task at hand, we\u2019re all prepared and we\u2019re ready to do it. The pressure is always high at any stage of the season but obviously it is coming to crunch time.",
        "\u201cWe\u2019ve got five cup finals left, and it\u2019s not just us who will be looking at it like that. But if we apply ourselves the way we know we can and keep to the level of performance we put in against Hibs (in the recent 1-1 draw), we should be good.\u201dGordon has been impressed by the manner in which his former team-mate Steven MacLean has handled himself since stepping up to become interim manager following the sacking of Callum Davidson last month.\u201cHe\u2019s been really good,\u201d said the defender. \u201cHe\u2019s obviously been in a coaching role for a while so he\u2019s got that experience under his belt but he\u2019s always been very knowledgeable, you could see that from the way he played the game himself.\u201cHe had a great understanding of the game, he was a very clever player. He\u2019s obviously his own man and he\u2019s putting his own ideas across, and the players are really buying into it and enjoying it.\u201cWe\u2019ve had a couple of good training weeks and the Hibs game was a good performance, so it\u2019s been all positive. The boys are upbeat and we\u2019re ready for the fight.\u201d"
