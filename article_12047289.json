        "A group of 14 Republican senators wrote a letter Wednesday to Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del ToroThey wanted to know why the Navy enlisted a 'TikTok drag queen' to beef up recruitment numbersYeoman 2nd Class Joshua Kelley, known as 'Harpy Daniels,' was one of five Navy 'Digital Ambassadors,' in a pilot program that ran through March\u00a0\u00a0A group of 14 Republican senators wrote a letter Wednesday\u00a0to Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro asking why the Navy enlisted a 'TikTok drag queen' to beef up recruitment numbers.\u00a0",
        "Sens. Ted Cruz, Rick Scott, Marco Rubio and others told Del Toro that 'we are concerned about both the promotion of a banned app and behavior that many deem inappropriate in a professional workplace.'\u00a0Their letter follows media coverage this week of how\u00a0Yeoman 2nd Class Joshua Kelley had been named a 'Digital Ambassador' for the Navy as part of a pilot program that started in November and ran through March.\u00a0Kelley goes by stage name\u00a0'Harpy Daniels' and has a strong following on social media, including TikTok, with 60,800 followers and 1.3 million likes. Kelley is also on Instagram\u00a0with nearly 9,000 followers.\u00a0In the videos, Kelley often starts out in uniform, and then reappears as Harpy Daniels. The non-binary drag queen dances and often shares an inspirational message about being an LGBTQ+ sailor.\u00a0",
        "In the letter, the Republicans first took issue with the Navy seemingly endorsing TikTok, with the choice of Kelley as a 'Digital Ambassador.'\u00a0They pointed to the\u00a0No TikTok on Government Devices Act, which President Joe Biden signed into law in December, and which bars the app from being downloaded onto U.S. government devices due to its Chinese owner.'The bottom line is that the Navy should not be promoting use of TikTok, an app banned on Department devices, on the personal devices of servicemembers or its \"ambassadors,\"' the letter stated.\u00a0",
        "The Republicans then moved on to the Navy's choice to make a drag queen a 'Digital Ambassador.'\u00a0'At a time when our nation's military is facing a recruiting crisis, it is as important as ever to reach broader swaths of the eligible population - but not at the cost of privacy, security, or professionalism,' the Republicans argued.\u00a0In the letter, they ask Del Toro if the Navy endorses drag shows.'Would the Navy enlist burlesque dancers or exotic dancers to reach possible recruits?' the senators ask. 'Such activity is not appropriate for promotion in a professional workplace or the United States military,' they add.The senators then ask Del Toro a number of questions about the ambassador program, including whether any federal funds were spent.\u00a0They gave the Navy secretary until May 24 to respond.\u00a0",
        "Kelley joined the Navy in 2016 and gave a drag performance for the first time as a sailor during a deployment in 2018.\u00a0In a post from November, when Kelley was named a 'Digital Ambassador,' the drag queen wrote that sharing drag with fellow sailors 'has been a blessing.'\u00a0'This experience has brought me so much strength, courage and ambition to continue being an advocate and representation of queer sailors!' Kelley wrote.\u00a0'Thank you to the Navy for giving me this opportunity! I don't speak for the Navy but simply sharing my experience in the Navy! Hooyah, and let's go Slay!' the drag queen added.\u00a0",
        "LGBTQ+ members of the military have fought for decades to serve openly.\u00a0In 1993, President Bill Clinton signed 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell,' which barred gay and lesbian Americans from serving openly, but was supposed to prohibit discrimination.\u00a0That policy got overturned by President Barack Obama and Democratic majorities in Congress in 2010.\u00a0In 2016, under the Obama administration, the ban on transgender service members was lifted.\u00a0However, in July 2017, then President Donald Trump reintroduced the ban via tweet.\u00a0President Joe Biden reversed the ban on his fifth day in office in January 2021.\u00a0More broadly, Republicans have continued to target the LGBTQ community with new laws.\u00a0In 2023, the American Civil Liberties Union tracked 471 anti-LGBTQ bills being pushed around the country.\u00a0"
