        "Some of Australia's biggest social media influencers have become victims of tall poppy syndrome simply due to their success and privilege.\u00a0",
        "Popular Instagram account Influencer Updates urged their followers to anonymously submit controversial opinions for them to post, and the results revealed a petty jealousy among many of the account's followers.One fan complained that influencers Sammy Robinson and Bella Varelis 'don't acknowledge that they come from rich privileged families'.As evidence, they pointed out that Sammy's family home overlooks the Sydney Harbour Bridge and that Bella once asked her father to send her money to buy a Dior bag after she was scammed by a dodgy ATM while on vacation in Italy.\u00a0Bella, who became an Instagram influencer after appearing on The Bachelor, made headlines last year after being scammed in Europe.",
        "The star had planned to splurge overseas, but wasn't able to splash out at a Dior store after a dodgy cash machine stole her holiday savings.But her daddy 'came to the rescue' by wiring over some emergency funds, which allowed her to 'spoil herself', she proudly explained to her online followers at the time.'I saved up so much before I left so I could spoil myself with something special on the trip, and then I got scammed by an ATM the other day and ended up feeling pretty disheartened,' she explained.",
        "'But dad ended up coming to the rescue so I decided to still spoil myself! And today is the day,' she added.\u00a0",
        "Elsewhere, another troll blasted teenage TikTok star Sophia Dopha for making a mistake while booking tickets for a holiday, claiming that it was insensitive to people who have less money than her.'Sophia is out of touch with reality,' the fan raged. 'Complaining about how she booked wrong dates for Europe and lost so much money whilst a lot of people are struggling to buy food and pay rent.'",
        "Another claimed that Brittany Hockley and Laura Byrne's Life Uncut podcast is 'flopping' now, despite it being one of the most downloaded podcasts in the country.'Life Uncut is flopping!' they wrote. 'People still love Laura but struggle to relate to Brittany. She's insufferable.'In January, due to the enormous success of Life Uncut, Brittany and Laura landed their own weekday radio show on KIIS FM called The Pick Up.\u00a0"
