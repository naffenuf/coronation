I will be pressing charges against this individual in order to uphold the civility our community deserves. Thank you to the Walton County Sheriff\u2019s office for taking swift action,' Gaetz said, first speaking about the incident on his podcast.\u00a0Defense attorney Matthew A. Karp said in an email that his own investigation has revealed that Gaetz and his group were engaged in a verbal altercation with a group of women at the South Walton Beaches Food &amp; Wine Festival.",
        "'This investigation has initially shown Rep. Gaetz to have been both an aggressor and agitator, and we look forward to taking his deposition,' Karp said. 'My client, Selena Chambers, maintains her innocence in this matter, and we intend to vigorously defend against the allegations of Rep. Gaetz.'Chambers pleaded not guilty.\u00a0\u00a0'We cannot allow an environment where you can throw things at elected officials because you don't like them,' Sheriff Michael Adkinson said in a statement. 'No matter your political affiliation, this is not the way to conduct yourself and will not be tolerated in Walton County.'",
        "Miramar Beach is about 50 miles east of Pensacola and is part of Gaetz's Florida Panhandle congressional district.The Associated Press found that this was not the first time Gaetz has had a drink tossed his way.\u00a0\u00a0In 2019, another woman was previously sentenced to 15 days in federal custody for\u00a0throwing a sports drink\u00a0at Gaetz.\u00a0",
        "Amanda Kondrat'yev was part of a group protesting outside a town hall meeting at a Pensacola restaurant.\u00a0A cup struck Gaetz in the back as he left the meeting, and several witnesses identified Kondrat'yev as the person who threw it.Gaetz, first elected to Congress in 2016, is known for his strong support of former President Donald Trump and his membership in the arch-conservative Freedom Caucus in the House.\u00a0He was among the group of Republicans who held up now House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's speakership vote as the GOP took over the chamber in January.\u00a0Things got so heated then that fellow Republican Rep. Mike Rogers had to be restrained from attacking Gaetz on the House floor.\u00a0\u00a0Earlier this year, Gaetz announced that the\u00a0Justice Department had decided not to file charges against him following a long-running sex-trafficking investigation."
