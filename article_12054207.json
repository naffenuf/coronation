        "Lewis Hamilton has described Mercedes\u2019 form as a \u201ckick in the guts\u201d \u2013 but team principal Toto Wolff insists his superstar driver will still sign a new contract.",
        "Hamilton heads into Sunday\u2019s Miami Grand Prix 45 points behind championship leader Max Verstappen after just four rounds of the season.The British driver\u2019s Mercedes team have endured a turbulent campaign.Hamilton finished second in Australia at the beginning of last month to raise hope of a Mercedes\u2019 fightback, but the 38-year-old, whose contract with the Brackley team expires in just over six months, was a distant sixth in Azerbaijan last weekend.And, despite an encouraging opening practice session at Miami\u2019s Hard Rock Stadium, with George Russell leading his team-mate in a Mercedes one-two, Hamilton ended the day\u2019s concluding running in seventh, nine tenths back from Verstappen.Asked for his assessment of Mercedes\u2019 speed in the Sunshine State, Hamilton replied: \u201cIt is the same as every weekend.\u201cWe are a second down. We are just not particularly quick. It is a struggle out there.\u201cWe are trying different things. First practice looked good and then we got to second practice and the true pace came out. It is a kick in the guts. It is difficult to take sometimes.\u201dMercedes are due to introduce an upgrade at the next round in Imola in a fortnight\u2019s time, but Wolff has already warned Hamilton that he will not have the speed to fight with Red Bull.",
        "Hamilton added: \u201cI am going to stay optimistic, but it feels like we are racing the same car as last year. We desperately need those upgrades, that is for sure.\u201cWe have to keep our heads down for one more race and hopefully we will start a new path at the next race.\u201dHamilton\u2019s future with Mercedes, and indeed in Formula One, continues to hang in the air. It\u2019s a work in progress, bouncing emails back and forth, and eventually we\u2019re going to sign it  Toto Wolff on Lewis Hamilton's contract  But Wolff believes Mercedes\u2019 failure to provide the Briton with a championship-winning machine will not prevent him from extending his stay with the team he joined in 2013.Wolff said: \u201cWe have been together for 11 years, and every single time when we talk about Lewis\u2019s contract, it\u2019s six months of, \u2018Where are we and what is happening?\u2019 And we keep seeing the same thing, that we\u2019re just rolling on.\u201cThe contract negotiations are not difficult. It\u2019s just putting a different timeline and a few different numbers in there. That is what we are doing and that is what we are working on.\u201cIt\u2019s a work in progress, bouncing emails back and forth, and eventually we\u2019re going to sign it.\u201d"
