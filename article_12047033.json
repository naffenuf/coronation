        "The current budget will \u201cdecimate public services\u201d in Northern Ireland, the Alliance Party leader has warned.",
        "Naomi Long also said Secretary of State Chris Heaton-Harris\u2019s hands were not clean in creating the current financial problems in the region.At the Alliance local election manifesto launch on Thursday, Ms Long responded to Mr Heaton-Harris\u2019s claim that: \u201cNorthern Ireland politicians got the budget into the state it\u2019s in, Northern Ireland politicians need to get us out of it.\u201dIn the absence of a devolved government Mr Heaton-Harris was responsible for setting the budget for Northern Ireland.",
        "The Stormont Executive is not currently functioning due to the DUP\u2019s ongoing protest against post-Brexit trading arrangements.Several Stormont departments have already warned they are facing significant challenges, with the PSNI citing a funding gap of \u00a3141 million and the Department of Health looking at a shortfall of \u00a3470 million.The Department of Infrastructure has warned that its budget pressures may result in streetlights being turned off and roads not being gritted in winter.Ms Long said: \u201cIn terms of the budget, and in terms of the Secretary of State, I have to say, I listened carefully to his throwaway remark yesterday that the budgetary problems in Northern Ireland are as a result of Northern Ireland\u2019s politicians.\u201cIt\u2019s almost as though Chris Heaton-Harris didn\u2019t support government austerity cuts, it\u2019s almost as though he didn\u2019t champion Brexit, which has caused much of the disruption that we\u2019re facing at the moment, it\u2019s almost as though he didn\u2019t back Boris Johnson and Liz Truss who damaged our economy immeasurably.",
        "\u201cThe idea that all of the challenges we face are simply down to local politicians, and that his hands are clean, is frankly laughable.\u201cWhat Chris Heaton-Harris needs to do if he really wants to be a Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is work with local politicians to work on the strategy.\u201d",
        "In her opening remarks Ms Long referred to the budget as a \u201cpunishment budget\u201d and said it would \u201cdecimate public services\u201d in Northern Ireland.\u00a0She also said the impact of the cuts will still be felt when the Stormont Assembly is eventually restored.\u00a0\u201cThe first is the budgetary constraints, and yes, they are significant and there is a punishment element to that budget, I think everyone acknowledges that,\u201d Ms Long said.\u00a0She added: \u201cAnd to be really clear, some of the changes that are being made, some of the cuts that are being imposed, are cuts that will not be able to be redressed in weeks or months if an Assembly is restored, which is why it\u2019s critical that we have an Assembly now.\u00a0\u201cTo actually send our executive ministers, not party leaders but executive ministers, to Treasury to talk about what\u2019s required in terms of having an invest to save strategy for Northern Ireland, a way of reforming our public services to make them sustainable, but also the pot of money that\u2019s needed to do that properly, and not by salami slicing what we already have.\u201d"
