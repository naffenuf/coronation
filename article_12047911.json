        "Here comes the Coronation Eclipse: a moment of potential breakthroughs. Eclipses are often considered to be bad omens for royalty, but this celestial event links to the Sun in Charles\u2019s birth chart, so it could play into his hands positively.\u00a0",
        "For everyone (not just the royals), success depends on how much control we feel the need to exert. The skies are promoting faith and optimism. By showing kindness, progress can be made.\u00a0Aries\u00a0Mar 21 - Apr 20\u00a0Although we\u2019re not supposed to look at life through rose-tinted spectacles, it\u2019s what we all do. How else can we explain our odd choices? We\u2019re all wearing invisible self-designed glasses. Which is why what looks rosy and exciting to one person looks pale and insignificant to someone else. This weekend, if you find yourself looking at something unacceptable, try adding an extra pink filter to your frames. It will make things easier to deal with, and you might find it changes your views. How will the Coronation Eclipse transform your life?\u00a0There\u2019s inspiring news in your latest forecast.

        "Taurus\u00a0Apr 21 - May 21\u00a0The idea of spending a night under the stars seems romantic. What could be more evocative than watching the constellations and marvelling at the enormity of the cosmos? Yet, most of the time, we sleep surrounded by bricks and mortar, sheltered from the rain, wind and cold. We want to feel safe, especially when we\u2019re asleep. Your ability to enjoy life doesn\u2019t depend on the actions of those around you (or on your material circumstances). You have a warm and welcoming place to retreat to whenever you wish. It\u2019s in your heart.\u00a0",
        "Let the power of the Coronation Eclipse inspire you. Call your four-minute forecast: 0906 751 5602.Gemini\u00a0May 22 - June 22\u00a0Although there\u2019s a difference between \u2018acting without thinking\u2019 and \u2018thinking without acting\u2019, it\u2019s difficult to say which is better (or worse). There are times when we have to trust our instincts and let impulse take us where intellect won\u2019t go. There are times, too, when it\u2019s better to ruminate than to rush. Ideas that don\u2019t lead to action can be better left in our imaginations. If something doesn\u2019t work as planned this weekend, it\u2019s because there\u2019s something better in the offing. Maximise the energy available to you.\u00a0The Coronation Eclipse can transform your world. Call 0906 751 5603.Cancer\u00a0June 23 - July 23It\u2019s hard to avoid nostalgia when looking back at the past. Our memories are selective: we forget the bad bits and struggles, and paint the rest with a golden hue. If you find yourself reminiscing this weekend, remember that you\u2019re embellishing the good and overlooking the not-so-good. Which is anxiety-producing. It makes it look as if the future is an ocean of doubt dotted with islands of uncertainty. Yet you\u2019ve sailed across such seas before. The Eclipse brings positive change. Just trust. The path ahead is right and good.\u00a0",

Since the lyrics don\u2019t contain any astrological references, it seems unlikely that it refers to a specific sign of the zodiac. But I mention it because it\u2019s a great example of how negative thinking can affect our lives. Under the influence of the Coronation Eclipse, you\u2019re able to see how something that seemed negative is transforming. Think positive and watch how the weekend evolves and gives you reasons to sing!\u00a0The Coronation Eclipse can change your life for the better.

        "Virgo\u00a0Aug 24 - Sep 23\u00a0Picture yourself as a rocket waiting to be launched. The countdown has begun. If you\u2019re feeling tense, it\u2019s only because you\u2019re aware of the enormity of what\u2019s about to happen. But tension isn\u2019t the same as fear. Anticipation only proves how much you want this. It\u2019s a moment to relish.

        "Aquarius\u00a0Jan 21 - Feb 19Our cosmos is so vast it defies understanding. We trust astronomers who say that some stars are 4,000 light years away, but that doesn\u2019t mean we can wrap our heads around the facts.
