        "Aberdeen manager Barry Robson has urged his players to show no fear at Ibrox on Sunday.",
        "The Dons have earned the right to be confident after winning their last seven matches, the most recent of which was a 2-0 victory over Rangers at Pittodrie before the cinch Premiership split.Former Inverness, Dundee United, Celtic and Aberdeen midfielder Robson, who started his career in the Rangers youth ranks, said: \u201cI have a few memories over the years as a player there.\u201cMy biggest thing as a player, as a person or as a manager is to go down there with no fear. Go and enjoy it, enjoy the cauldron of atmosphere.\u201cWhen you\u2019re a young player, and you\u2019re coming into the game, that\u2019s where you want to play, in the big arenas. The arena where the pressure is on. Where it\u2019s hostile, where they will come after you and that\u2019s what the game is.\u201cThat\u2019s where you need to be as a player, your mindset as a player. Don\u2019t fear it.",
        "\u201cYou might come up against better players whatever league you are in but you\u2019ve got to try and embrace it.\u201cMyself, when I played with different teams, coming up against big teams, we always enjoyed it and stayed in the fight.\u201cThat\u2019s what my message is, clear to the players: be brave, be brave with the ball and also be brave without the ball.\u201d"
