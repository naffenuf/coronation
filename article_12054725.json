        "REPORT:\u00a0Frank Lampard FINALLY gets his first win as Chelsea's interim bossDominic Solanke struggled after leaving Chelsea but he's now thriving againKante was involved around Bournemouth area every bit as much as his own halfChelsea secured their first win under Frank Lampard's second reign at the club after beating Bournemouth 3-1 at the Vitality Stadium.\u00a0",
        "The Blues took the lead after just nine minutes through Conor Gallagher's header following a cross from N'Golo Kante.\u00a0Bournemouth got back on level terms in the 21st minute, with Matias Vina scoring a stunning curler from the edge of the box.\u00a0But it was two late goals from January signings Benoit Badiashile and Joao Felix that ensured Chelsea picked up their first three points since March 11.\u00a0Mail Sport's Riath Al-Samarrai takes a look at some of the things you may have missed.\u00a0",
        "DOMINIC SOLANKE'S RESURGENCE\u00a0Chelsea\u2019s loss has been Bournemouth\u2019s gain in the slowly evolving fortunes of Dominic Solanke.\u00a0It\u2019s been tempting for many years to think back to his time as one of the very brightest stars in the academy at Cobham, and of course that has been followed by a prolonged period of mediocrity, including decent chunk of his spell at Bournemouth.He seems to have turned that corner now, having been shortlisted for April\u2019s player of the month gong (three goals and three assists) and delivering another solid shift here.\u00a0There\u2019s no great argument to be made for Chelsea needing him, but he has certainly been integral to Gary O\u2019Neil\u2019s resuscitation act on the south coast.",
        "CHELSEA FANS' WHIRLWIND AFTERNOON\u00a0\u00a0An interesting day to observe the Chelsea supporters at a time of crisis for their club. Initially their contributions nosed on the gallows humour of their predicament and it was quite amusing.\u00a0",
        "When Conor Gallagher headed them in front in the ninth minute, it prompted the chorus: \u2018We are staying up, we are staying up.\u2019 A moment later: \u2018How s*** must you be, we\u2019re winning away.\u2019\u00a0Over the course of the game, that evolved to more questionable chants for Roman Abramovich, which would seem to be a selective appreciation of his history, before the booing of a couple of Frank Lampard\u2019s substitutions, including the introductions of Raheem Sterling and Hakim Ziyech.\u00a0By the end, we were deep into \u2018Super Frankie Lampard\u2019 territory.",
        "HOLES IN SOCKS\u00a0\u00a0The peculiar trend for players cutting holes in the backs of their socks is nothing new, but Gallagher takes it to a bizarre extreme with two huge incisions in each.\u00a0As one press box observer put it, they looked like badly laddered tights.",
        "JOHN BROOKS DISPLAYS HIS AUTHORITY\u00a0\u00a0John Brooks, who was the victim of Jurgen Klopp\u2019s little outburst as fourth official for Liverpool\u2019s win over Tottenham a week ago, was referee here.\u00a0Perhaps it was in sympathy for those of his profession that he took Enzo Fernandez to task for mouthing off to assistant referee Matthew Wilkes in the first half. Brooks politely told the Chelsea midfielder to zip it.KANTE IMPRESSES IN ATTACK\u00a0\u00a0The deployment of N\u2019Golo Kante in more attacking positions is often a divisive topic among Chelsea\u2019s support.\u00a0",
        "In this game and several others it has been a recurring theme to see him get forward and, as the touch map will show, he was involved around the Bournemouth area every bit as much as his own half. His cross for Gallagher\u2019s opener was excellent."
