        "David Warner was run out for two as Delhi collapsed against GujaratThe Aussie opener was victim of a calamitous call from Priyam GargWarner averages 34.2 in the IPL this season but Delhi have won just two games\u00a0David Warner's IPL struggles continued overnight on Wednesday (AEDT) with the Aussie batter run out off a no ball as his Delhi Capitals collapsed against the Gujarat Titans.",
        "Mohammed Shami removed Phil Salt with the first delivery of the match and the veteran opener soon joined him back in the sheds after a calamitous run out, but through no fault of his own.\u00a0Priyam Garg pushed Hardik Pandya's delivery to midwicket and took a couple of steps forward before suddenly changing his min\u00a0 and retreating back into the crease.Already down the wicket by the time he realised Garg wasn't running, Warner was left stranded as Rashid Khan nonchalantly removed the bails at the bowler's end.Adding insult to injury, as Warner walked off replays showed the delivery to be a no-ball as Pandya had overstepped.",
        "The 36-year-old departed with just two runs to his name and worse still was to come for his team, as Delhi lost five wickets within the first five overs with Shami finishing with figures of four for 11 in his four overs.\u00a0After making four 50s in his first six IPL games this season, Warner has struggled for form over the past week.\u00a0He made 21 off 20 balls as the Capitals beat\u00a0Sunrisers Hyderabad by seven runs last Monday, but was\u00a0bowled for a duck by Mukesh Kumar as Delhi lost the reverse fixture by nine runs on Saturday.The Aussie opener averages 34.2 with a 118.46 strike rate in nine IPL innings this season but Delhi are rooted to the bottom of the table with just two wins in eight games.\u00a0",
        "Last week Warner was heavily criticised by former Indian spinner Harbhajan Singh, who lambasted the Capitals skipper as the chief reason for the team's poor performances.Warner's slow scoring rate has come under scrutiny in the IPL this season and\u00a0Harbhajan singled it out as the Aussie's biggest issue.\u00a0\u00a0'I don\u2019t think they can make a comeback, and the entire reason for that is captain,' he said in a video on his YouTube channel.'He didn\u2019t lead the side well, and then his form was an issue.'It has been very disappointing. Warner was dismissed earlier on Saturday [against Sunrisers] , which is why Delhi came so close.\u00a0'If he had played 50 balls, that would\u2019ve been 50 balls wasted and the Capitals would\u2019ve lost by 50 runs. [...]\u00a0Warner hasn\u2019t really done justice to his stature this year. His 300 runs are of no use to Delhi.'\u00a0"
