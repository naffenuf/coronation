        "Plymouth manager Steven Schumacher made their League One title success about everyone but himself following a 3-1 victory over Port Vale on the final day.",
        "Argyle had to come from behind as Vale were determined to spoil the party by taking an early lead through James Plant.Goals from Adam Randell and Joe Edwards fired Plymouth in front before Finn Azaz put Vale out of sight.Schumacher said: \u201cThis means the world to us, we\u2019ve fought so hard week in and week out since the last day last season when we just fell short in the play-offs.\u201cThe work has been going since then and we felt we could mount a challenge.\u201cAll the staff, all the players, everybody has just given everything they\u2019ve got and we managed to become champions. We\u2019ve deserved it.",
        "\u201cThe game was a good game, credit to Port Vale. I thought they had a great spirit and played the game the right way.\u201cThey took a great goal to score but our lads showed brilliant character to come from behind and win the game.\u201cThe bus journey back is going to be very lively. Everybody should be really proud and now it\u2019s time to get the party started.\u201dInterim Vale boss Andy Crosby felt his side had a good first half but that they have a lot of work to do in the summer ahead of next season.He said: \u201cFirst of all I have to say congratulations to Plymouth.",
        "\u201cTo reach the points they have in a 46-game season is a massive credit to them \u2013 the whole football club, from the owner to the manager and the players.\u201cI was delighted with how we started the game but then we couldn\u2019t maintain possession for long enough periods of time.\u201cIt\u2019s a really big two months for the football club to recruit to the level required at League One football.\u201cThere\u2019s a massive difference between League Two and if you can\u2019t do the basics of the game you\u2019re going to really struggle.\u201cWe were a play-off winning team and had a great first half of the season.\u201cWe plateaued and the signs have been there, it\u2019s a big summer ahead. Recruiting players to play the way we want to play is vital.\u201cMy future will become clearer over the next few days. I\u2019ve been a player, an assistant manager and now I think I\u2019m ready.\u201cThere\u2019s no guarantee in any appointment for any football club, there\u2019s always a risk and we will see what happens.\u201d"
