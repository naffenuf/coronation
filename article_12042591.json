        "WASHINGTON, May 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury's estimate that it could run short of cash to satisfy all U.S. payment obligations as early as June 1 is its \"best estimate\" based on recent tax receipts, Treasury Assistant Secretary for Financial Markets Joshua Frost said on Wednesday.",
        "He told a news conference after Treasury's quarterly refunding announcement: \"Receipts and outlays are just inherently variable, and the actual date will depend on realized receipts and outlays, and the date on which we have exhausted our resources could be a number of weeks later than those estimates.\" (Reporting by David Lawder; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)"
