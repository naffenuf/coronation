        "Presenter Melanie Sykes has revealed she avoided sex for a year after using it as a \u2018Band-Aid\u2019 to patch up problems in her relationships.",
        "The former model, 52, also spoke about having a string of toyboy lovers, and said that her despite a period of celibacy, her libido remains \u2018high\u2019.\u2018I\u2019ve been written off as some predator for young men,\u2019 she told The Shift, a podcast for women over 40.\u00a0\u2018I don\u2019t have an age, I\u2019m just spirited. And I meet spirited people that I want to whirl around with for a while, while it feels good.\u2018When it doesn\u2019t, I\u2019ll whirl around with somebody else.\u2019",
        "Last year, Mel ended her romance with gondolier Riccardo Simionato, who was 22 while she was 50.Before that she had been married to Jack Cockings, who was 16 years younger than her, and she also dated German golf pro Martin Kaymer, who was 14 years her junior.\u2018It got to a point where I had a few boyfriends on the bounce that were 27,\u2019 she said. \u2018So what? I like the energy of a certain age.\u2018It\u2019s very rare to meet a man of my age with the energy that I\u2019ve got. And I don\u2019t mean for marathon sex sessions, I mean like life.\u2019The TV star, who has two children with her first husband, actor Daniel Caltagirone, said she found more \u2018respect\u2019 for herself after she endured a period of celibacy.",
        "\u2018I\u2019ve always had a high libido,\u2019 she said. \u2018Because I wanted to have sex with someone, I would. But it wasn\u2019t necessarily good for me, or they weren\u2019t particularly nice people.\u2018But if you\u2019re driven by your libido, which men are notorious for and women not so much - which I think is bull**** because I think loads of women just want to get f***** sometimes and there\u2019s nothing wrong with it \u2013 but I also realised that I needed a connection.\u2018It\u2019s like putting a Band-Aid on something. If you can resolve an argument with a really great session of sex, it doesn\u2019t mean the problem has gone.",
        "\u2018And I thought if I withdraw the sex, then the problems I can just avoid.\u2018And so I\u2019ve just avoided. And after a year I was so much more understanding of myself and had more respect for myself.\u2018I won\u2019t lay with anyone that isn\u2019t my equal ever again. It\u2019s as simple as that because I don\u2019t like casual sex. I tried it, I don\u2019t like it.\u2018But it doesn\u2019t stop me wanting to have sex because that\u2019s just me being a full-on woman who likes it. What\u2019s wrong? There\u2019s nothing wrong with it.\u2019She also defended Leonardo DiCaprio over his reported penchant for dating women under 25, claiming it is \u2018normal\u2019.",
        "\u2018He\u2019s got a type. He likes them that age,\u2019 she added.Melanie, who also revealed she is \u2018turned on by smart women\u2019, was on the podcast to promote the release of her autobiography, Illuminated: Autism &amp; All The Things I\u2019ve Left Unsaid."
