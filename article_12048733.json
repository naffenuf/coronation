        "(Muswell Press \u00a39.99, 368pp)With the violent death of a private tutor to the mega rich, Inspector Garibaldi is pitched into the world of hothouse parenting.

Even so, he is convinced they are holding something back. Likewise their parents, whose priority is to protect their fa\u00e7ade of upper-crust gentility.While Garibaldi struggles to make sense of what appears to be a motiveless crime, the complications multiply with a succession of knife-point threats against the victim\u2019s friends and fellow tutors.As the secrets of the sheltered life of entitlement begin to emerge, the twists and turns of an exceptionally clever plot make for compulsive reading. In this, the second of the Garibaldi mysteries, Bernard O\u2019Keefe proves to be a star turn.Murder in Dublinby Christina Koning",
