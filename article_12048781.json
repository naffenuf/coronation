        "Hailey Bieber was seen with her close friend, Lori Harvey, as they stepped out wearing comfy, black and white outfits while enjoying an outing in Beverly Hills on Thursday.\u00a0",
        "The Rhode founder, 26 - who was chic running errands in LA earlier Tuesday after choosing to skip the MET Gala for the first time in eight years - strolled through a parking garage with the model, also 26, by her side.\u00a0The wife of Justin Bieber donned a long-sleeved, black hooded sweatshirt that was zipped up towards the base of her collarbone.\u00a0She additionally slipped into a pair of black, gym shorts that easily showed off her toned legs.\u00a0The star completed her casual ensemble for the day by adding white crew socks and white, Nike sneakers that were tightly secured with laces.\u00a0",
        "Hailey's short locks were slicked back into a ponytail to prevent any loose strands from falling onto her face.\u00a0She accessorized her look by adding a flashy, gold-chained necklace along with a pair of dainty, gold-hooped earrings.\u00a0The model threw on a pair of rectangular-shaped, black shades for a stylish flare and to protect her eyes when stepping out into the bright sunshine.\u00a0The businesswomen, who recently opened up about her mental health\u00a0and going through a 'hard time,' opted to not carry any purses or handbags for the outing, and instead simply carried her smartphone in her right hand.\u00a0Lori also opted for casual comfort wearing a pair of fitted, black and dark gray camouflage leggings and flashed her toned midriff in a long-sleeved, white cropped top.\u00a0",
        "The daughter of Steve Harvey slipped into a pair of white sneakers that contained a light blue stripe.\u00a0The media star slung a sleek, black purse over her left shoulder to hold a few items she needed during the day. Similar to her friend, Lori also threw on a pair of fashionable, black shades.\u00a0Her locks were slicked back and styled into a tight bun at the back of her head, revealing a pair of small, dangly gold earrings.\u00a0\u00a0",
        "Hailey was absent from the MET Gala that was held earlier this week on Monday after opting to not attend for the first time in eight years.\u00a0The star has recently been vocal about having a 'hard time' throughout 2023 in a message she uploaded on Instagram late last month.\u00a0'I like to make jokes about how I feel because sometimes it's easier than admitting I'm having a hard time. But truthfully since 2023 started I have had some of the saddest, hardest moments in my adult life and my mind and emotions have been fragile to say the least...'\u00a0She continued, 'And I know so many other people feel the way I feel, so just know you're not alone.'\u00a0In conclusion, the Rhode founder added, 'That being said, let's keep being there for one another. Let's be there for loved ones and friends and family and strangers. Let's be there for people...let's keep showing up for each other even when it's hard. We're better together.'\u00a0",
        "Not long after the post was uploaded, a source told Us Weekly that Justin Bieber was heartbroken over his wife's situation. 'It breaks Justin\u2019s heart to have seen Hailey struggling emotionally the way she has been these past few months.'\u00a0\u00a0The insider added, 'He loves his wife more than anything\u00a0and knows she has a heart of gold.'\u00a0Earlier this year in January, Hailey and Kendall Jenner posted a since-deleted TikTok video as they lip-synced, 'And I\u2019m not saying she deserved it, but I\u2019m saying God\u2019s timing is always right.'\u00a0",
        "Fans of Selena Gomez quickly speculated that the lyrics were in reference to the Justin's ex.\u00a0However, in March, the Only Murders In The Building actress jumped to her Instagram stories to call for peace and broke silence on the drama.\u00a0'Hailey Bieber reached out to me and let me know that she has been receiving death threats and such hateful negativity.'\u00a0'This isn't what I stand for. No one should have to experience hate or bullying. I've always advocated for kindness and really want this all to stop.'\u00a0Although Hailey was absent at the star-studded MET Gala this year, she still made her way to the Big Apple and attended the Tiffany &amp; Co. grand re-opening in NYC earlier last week.\u00a0"
