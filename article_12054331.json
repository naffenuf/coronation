        "Fashion designer Victoria Beckham and her husband, former England footballer David, also paid tribute on social media to Charles and Camilla as the royal couple were crowned at Westminster Abbey on Saturday.Fry, who was among the more than 2,000 guests at the ceremony, told the PA news agency: \u201cI thought the service was magnificent.",
        "\u201cI mean truly wonderful. The music to start with was just inspiring, both the real kind of hammer-blow classics, the principal one I suppose has to be Handel\u2019s Zadok The Priest at the time of the anointing because it quotes a passage of the Bible, which is exactly consonant with this idea of anointing.\u201cAnd it just has this power that only Handel could muster \u2013 it\u2019s similar to his Hallelujah Chorus, you know, just has this phenomenal sort of depth and force to it.\u201dHe added: \u201cIt was very moving and the King looked vulnerable, which all monarchs do when they\u2019re being crowned, they\u2019re being encumbered with all these symbols and all this heavy cloak and this sceptre, the orb, the heavy crown, which means he can barely move.\u201cAnd in a strange way, I\u2019m sure not deliberately originally, but it\u2019s kind of symbolic of the encumbrances in life that you have if you\u2019re a monarch, so it\u2019s a very touching ceremony.",
        "\u201cHe\u2019s quite lonely somehow \u2013 as the Queen was if you watch the 1953 coronation \u2013 but I feel very lucky to have been there.\u201dTV presenting duo Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly spoke about how \u201cfantastic\u201d it was to witness the coronation.\u201cThe view was very good by the way, we were here, and then there was only one row, then he (the King) walked past, they all walked past,\u201d McPartlin told ITV News as he left Westminster Abbey.McPartlin said that the most amazing moment of the ceremony was \u201cwhen the crown went on\u201d.\u201cThe crowning, the whole thing, just a fantastic day,\u201d added Donnelly.Beatles star Sir Paul posted a picture on Instagram of him and Charles on stage together, writing: \u201cEnjoy this special day in our country\u2019s history\u201d.Music veteran Sir Elton shared a photo of the King donning royal regalia as he congratulated him in an Instagram post.It was previously confirmed to Rolling Stone magazine that Sir Elton had been asked to play at Sunday\u2019s coronation concert but could not \u201cdue to scheduling issues\u201d, with the musician on his Farewell Yellow Brick Tour.Welsh actress Catherine Zeta-Jones also offered her love and support to the royal couple on the historic day.Alongside a series of images of her meeting Charles, she wrote: \u201cGod Save the King. God bless the Queen. All my love to King Charles and Queen Camilla.",
        "\u201cRight now I am here in Britain, in my best robe, eating scones with clotted cream and drinking copious amounts of English breakfast tea as I await history being made.\u201dVictoria Beckham recalled \u201cfond memories\u201d of Charles over the years, describing him as \u201cso supportive and kind\u201d.The former Spice Girl posted a number of images of the British girl group meeting the King as she wrote: \u201cFrom then to now! I have so many fond memories of meeting His Majesty throughout my career, and he is always so supportive and kind.\u201cToday is a truly historic day and I\u2019m incredibly humbled to celebrate King Charles III and Queen Camilla as they embark on their new roles. VB\u201dThe Spice Girls\u2019 official Instagram account also remembered the group\u2019s famous encounter with Charles in 1997 where they broke royal protocol as Melanie Brown and Geri Horner gave him a kiss.\u201cToday marks the coronation of HM King Charles III. Here\u2019s the first time we met at the Royal Gala in 1997\u201d, they wrote alongside an image of the moment.David Beckham wrote on Instagram: \u201cToday our country comes together to celebrate the coronation of Their Majesties King Charles III and Queen Camilla.\u201dFormer I\u2019m A Celebrity winner and podcaster Giovanna Fletcher, who is an ambassador for the Prince\u2019s Trust, the charity founded in 1976 by the now King, wrote on Instagram: \u201cAs an ambassador for @princestrust I\u2019ve seen first hand the impact King Charles has had through his work, and I look forward to seeing his passion to help others grow in the future.",
        "\u201cHaving met the King a couple of times in the past, I have to say I\u2019ve found him very driven in what he believes in, and a little bit cheeky! #kingcharles\u201d."
