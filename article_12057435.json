        "Jamie Lee Komoroski, 25,\u00a0is being represented by\u00a0Nathan S. Williams \u2014 a former federal prosecutor who put South Carolina church-shooter Dylan Roof on death row \u2014 and former New Jersey county prosecutor Christopher J. Gramiccioni, court records obtained by DailyMail.com showed.Komoroski, who grew up in New Jersey but recently relocated to South Carolina, is accused of drunkenly driving into a golf cart carrying Samantha Miller, 34, and Aric Hutchinson, 36 on April 28 as they were being driven from their wedding.Miller was killed at the scene and Hutchinson was left seriously injured.Komoroski was taken into custody after the accident and charged with three counts of felony DUI resulting in great bodily harm or death and one count of reckless homicide.Williams and Gramiccioni confirmed to the DailyMail.com they would be representing Komoroski and said: 'We cannot fathom what the families are going through and offer our deepest sympathies.",
        "'We simply ask that there not be a rush to judgment.\u00a0'Our court system is founded upon principles of justice and mercy and that is where all facts will come to light.'\u00a0With Williams and Gramiccioni in her corner, Komoroski has assembled a formidable defense team.Williams gained national attention in 2015 when he successfully prosecuted Roof, who murdered\u00a0nine parishioners during a bible study session at the\u00a0Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in a racially motivated attack.",
        "The prosecution secured a guilty verdict and death sentence for Roof in 2017.He also prosecuted banker Chris Latham and his mistress Wendy Moore in 2014, who conspired to have Latham's wife murdered. Moore was sentenced to 15 years in prison and Latham to 10.In 2015 he prosecuted Dorothy Barnett for abducting her 10-month-old daughter 20 years prior, according to Legal Newswire, and he secured the death penalty for Brandon Council, who executed a pair of bank employees during a brazen bank robbery in Conway, South Carolina.Gramiccioni served as the top prosecutor in Monmouth County, New Jersey, for nine years, according to the Asbury Park Press, before opening a private firm with his wife in 2021.One of his prominent cases was the prosecution of\u00a0Liam McAtasney, who was found guilty of strangling his 19-year-old childhood friend Sarah Stern to death.\u00a0McAtasney was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\u00a0",
        "Miller and her new husband were leaving the scene of their wedding at Folly Beach in April and were heading to their rented Airbnb when the fatal crash happened.It was supposed to be 'a quick journey from the venue to their Airbnb for their wedding night,' Mandi Jenkins, Miller's sister, told ABC4.But when Komoroski's rented Toyota Camry slammed into their low-speed vehicle \u2014 which authorities say was equipped with headlights, brake lights, turn signals, seat belts, an advanced braking system and reflectors \u2014 the vehicle rolled over several times.",
        "By the time the first officer arrived, he described in a sworn affidavit how there was 'a large\u00a0crash scene with a golf cart on its side' and several victims laying among the wreckage.'He said his priority was treating the new bride, but when his efforts failed, he also rendered aid to Hutchinson and another member of their bridal party, Garrett Hutchinson.Another officer said he was unsure if the groom would 'make it through the night' following the crash.\u00a0",
        "Once the first officer was done triaging the injured parties, the officer said he then turned his attention to Komoroski, who was not injured in the collision.The officer said the 25-year-old Logistics Account Executive smelled of alcohol and was unsteady on her feet.\u00a0She had trouble standing, the responding officer described, and when asked to rate her impairment on a scale of one to 10, she replied that she was at a level eight.But, the officer said, Komoroski told\u00a0cops at the scene that all she had to drink was one beer and one tequila about an hour before.And when asked to perform a field sobriety test, the officer wrote 'she strongly refused and became uncooperative.'\u00a0By the time police arrested Komoroski, they wrote in an affidavit she told hospital staff that she 'wanted to kill herself', before she was put into Charleston County Jail.",
        "Komoroski is now said to be on suicide watch, and is due back in court in June.She could face up to 25 years in prison for the death of the bride, as well as a fine of up to $25,100, and an additional 15 years and $10,100 for the serious injury caused to the men in the buggy.For the reckless homicide count she could be handed a sentence of 10 years in prison, and a fine of up to $5,000 \u2013 as well as having her license revoked for five years on her release.",
        "She had previously been charged with speeding on May 31, 2018 in Horry County, South Carolina - home of Myrtle Beach and Coastal Carolina University, where Komoroski attended school.The 25-year-old was accused of speeding less than 10 miles per hour over the speed limit, to which she pleaded guilty and paid a $76.50 fine.Later that year, Komoroski pleaded guilty to a count of driving a vehicle at a speed that is unreasonable road conditions. She was arrested in November during a rare freeze warning in the popular tourist area.In 2019, Komoroski was again charged with speeding 10mph or less over the speed limit, to which she again pleaded guilty and paid another $76.50.",
        "More recently, she was cited for failure to use a turn signal or stop signal, to which she pleaded guilty on April 5, 2023, and paid a $25 fine.",
        "A review of Komoroski's social media also found that she once\u00a0proudly posted a note she was given for parking in an 'inconsiderate and rude' way.She received the letter after bragging about 'battling for a parking spot', and was branded an 'entitled b****' after the incident in 2017.Posting the angry note online with the caption 'this b*** got p*ssed', the author of the message said: 'I'm sorry your mother didn't raise you to be a considerate person.'Hope you made it to whatever was so important to cause you to be that rude, hopefully you're not always like that. Have a wonderful day you entitle b***h.'Other pictures posted on her social media show her asking for 'plan B' with the hashtag 'getting that d***'.And another shows what appears to be marijuana in 2017. The drug is illegal in both New Jersey, where she grew up, and South Carolina, where she attended school.\u00a0Komoroski could also be seen in social media posts pouring alcohol into her friend's mouth before swigging it herself when she was underage.",
        "Another post appeared to show her making a joke about crashing her white jeep on the beach, captioned 'I almost veered off into the ocean #oops'.",
        "It comes after DailyMail.com revealed images of the alleged drunk driver dressed as a bottle of Bud Light in 2018 \u2013 when she was underage.She had Bud Light logos strapped to her wrists and legs and the word 'year' scrawled on her T-Shirt.The outfit appears to have been a boozy Halloween pun on Toy Story character Buzz Lightyear, with Komoroski also wearing a makeshift pair of wings, similar to those seen on the toy spaceman.That snap is one of many on Komoroski's Instagram that refer to alcohol, or show her enjoying a drink.Her most recent photo - uploaded to Instagram last Tuesday - show her posing on a beach in a white bikini, with the caption 'Did someone say tequila?'Another uploaded on May 22 shows her clutching a can with the caption 'Chin up, butter cup!'.And in October 2018, Komoroski was snapped holding up a bottle of what appeared to be sparkling wine to her mouth, with the caption 'Tailgate Queens.'Hauntingly, Komoroski uploaded a photograph of herself on Folly Beach on March 28 - the same spot where her victims held their nuptials before Friday's tragic crash.",
        "Meanwhile, Hutchinson and one of his friends are continuing to recover at a local hospital.'He's laid up with gravel stuck in his head, stuck in his legs, stuck in his arms,' Jenkins told ABC4. 'He's going to be recovering too. And he said to me today they were having so much fun on my [LSV].'And Miller's family is also preparing for her funeral.'If she's cremated, we're going to bring her to Folly Beach,' her mother, Lisa, said. 'That's where she wants to be.'"
