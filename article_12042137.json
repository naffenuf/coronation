I don't care if he was here legally. I don't care if he was here illegally. He was in my county'Honduran flags are seen decorating a tree where the five people were shot and killed, as the Foreign Ministry prepares to repatriate their remains.'He discovered that some of the people escaped and came back to finish them off and shot them in the head.
