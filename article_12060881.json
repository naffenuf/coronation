        "Simon tweeted from the picket line as he revealed HBO 'called\u00a0to suspend my deal after 25 years of writing television for them'. He said the suspension was because he'd joined the action.Posting a video from the strike at\u00a0Silvercup Studios in Queens, New York, Simon quipped: 'I was doing the write thing.'The Wire is one of HBO's most successful shows and was a springboard for the careers of several of its stars, including Idris Elba and Dominic West.Simon has also written on many other shows, including Generation Hero, We Own This City and The Plot Against America.",
        "Thousands of Hollywood film and TV writers have hit the picket lines after the Writers Guild of America called its first strike in 16 years.An estimated 11,500 members have downed tools after talks with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers over pay fell apart.The strike is expected has impacted running order of late night television shows and, depending on the length of strike, could affect planned TV series and movies.At the center of the row is the rise of streaming - with the guild claiming that even as budgets have increased, writers' share of that cash has consistently shrunk.Simon said his contract suspension was due to the 'strike response and not unexpected'.",
        "Striking Writers Guild of America members have received support from celebrities such a Drew Barrymore, who pulled out of her hosting duties at the MTV Movie and TV Awards, and Pete Davidson, who passed out pizzas on Friday to those walking the picket line in New York.However, several show runners, the executives with creative control over a program, say they have received letters from Warner Bros/Discovery owned HBO, Disney, and Paramount owned CBS requiring them to fulfill their non-writing obligations.'If you are a WGA member, HBO/HBO Max respects your membership in the WGA, and we will not do anything to place you in jeopardy of WGA rules,' read a May 2 letter from the network.'However, we believe certain services, such as participating in the cast process and/or contributing to non-writing production, and post-production work are clear examples of non-WGA required services that should continue to be rendered during this time,' the letter stated.'Under the National Labor Relations Act, the WGA is not permitted to interfere with an employer's right to designate employees to perform certain supervisory functions.'The document then listed those duties, followed by a caveat in the FAQ portion which read, 'If you fail to provide contracted services due to the strike, HBO/HBO Max will not be obliged to continue your salary.'",
        "The letter added yet another warning. 'Further, if production is interrupted by the strike, even if you offer to continue to work, HBO/HBO Max will not be obliged to continue your salary, nor the salary of the cast and crew.'Disney, which owns ABC and 20th Century Television, sent out a similar letter the following day, which included 'Studio intends to stay in production during the WGA strike and we are legally entitled to do so.'Pete Davidson passed out free pizzas to picketers in New York City on Friday as he continued to support the Writers Guild strike that has brought Hollywood to a standstill.The 29-year-old comedian delivered a stack of authentic pizza pies from the landmark Brooklyn eatery Spumoni Gardens.In footage uploaded to Twitter, Davidson strolled up in a black hoodie and matching sweatpants as hungry picketers greeted him with open arms and grateful smiles.'You got Spumoni's!?' marveled one picketer, to which Davidson replied: 'I got Spumoni for everyone. You gotta support the writers, man. No shows without the writers.'"
