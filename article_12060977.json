        "LA Superior Court Judge David Herriford on Tuesday denied Tory Lanez's motion for a new trial, saying he didn't see a reason for a do-over\u00a0'Even if there were errors at trial\u2026.they were small errors and there would not have been a different result,' the judge said\u00a0It comes after rapper's new lawyer, Jose Baez, who represented Casey Anthony, argued that the guilty verdict in December was a 'miscarriage of justice'A Los Angeles Judge has thrown out Tory Lanez's bid for a new trial after the rapper was convicted of shooting his former lover and fellow hip-hop star Megan Thee Stallion last year.\u00a0",
        "The 30 year-old's new defense team had argued that the guilty verdicts on the three felonies brought against him in December were a 'miscarriage of justice,' that prosecutors at had 'painted Lanez as a gun-wielding career criminal,' and that his trial attorney was 'ineffective.'But on Tuesday, LA Superior Court Judge David Herriford denied the motion for a new trial, telling the court he could see no reason for a trial do-over and dismissing the defense's several objections to the manner the original trial was conducted.'Even if there were errors at trial\u2026.they were small errors and there would not have been a different result,' he said.",
        "The judge also shot down the accusation from the singer's new defense team that his lead lawyer during the trial, George Mgdesyan, did a poor job defending his Lanez.'Mr. Mgdesyan presented a very vigorous and robust defense of his client,' said Judge Herriford.Earlier Tuesday, Lanez's Florida-based attorney, Jose Baez, tried to prevent Judge Herriford from issuing his denial of a new trial\u00a0 by filing a motion to disqualify the judge from the case.'We are objecting to the court issuing a ruling,' Baez said. 'It is our request that the proceeding (the ruling on the new trial) be stayed till the issue now disqualification is resolved.'",
        "But the judge turned down his request, telling the court that there was nothing in California statutes preventing him from making a ruling Tuesday and dealing with the disqualification motion later.He noted that if he was later disqualified from the case, his ruling Tuesday to deny the motion for a new trial, would be voided.Later Tuesday, after Lanez\u2019s attorney Barthoma lodged a formal objection to Judge Herriford\u2019s denial of the motion for a new trial, the judge dismissed as \u2018untimely\u2019 the defense motion to disqualify him from the case.The judge scheduled June 13 for sentencing of Lanez.In several heated exchanges during a hearing Monday, Judge Herriford clashed with Baez and his other new lawyer Matthew Barthoma over how the attorneys would present their motion for a new trial.And Monday's proceedings ended abruptly with Lanez begging the judge, 'Please don't ruin my life sir.'",
        "Appearing in the downtown courtroom Tuesday, handcuffed and in orange prison overalls, Lanez \u2013 currently Los Angeles Men's Central Jail inmate number 6523038 \u2013is facing up to 22 years in jail, plus possible deportation to his native Canada, for shooting Megan in the feet during a drunken 2020 argument that also involved Megan's best friend and assistant Kelsey Harris.Lanez's attorney at trial, Mgdesyan, presented a defense claiming that it wasn't Lanez but Harris who fired the gun in a fit of jealousy and anger at Megan when she found out the singer had 'backstabbed' her by sleeping with Lanez, whom Kelsey had also been involved with.",
        "That defense was seriously undermined, insisted Lanez's new attorney, Jose Baez \u2013 who represented Casey Anthony at her trial for the death of her daughter \u2013 when Judge Herriford 'erroneously allowed' jurors to see a post on the musician's personal Instagram account in which Lanez supposedly said that Harris was not the shooter.That posting was not actually made by Lanez himself, say his lawyers, but by his content creator who was managing Lanez's account.Deputy District Attorney Alex Bott countered Monday, dismissing the Instagram post as a ' minor piece of evidence' and saying that the prosecution used it alongside 'multiple witnesses who identified the defendant as the shooter.'The defense argued that it was wrong of prosecutors to allow jurors to hear Megan's statement to police right after the shooting in which she said that Tory told her, 'Please don't say anything because I'm on probation.'But Bott responded, 'We believe that testimony was fully admissible. It was in the context of him (Lanez) trying to buy their (Megan and Harris) silence.'Another reason for his motion for a new trial, said Baez Monday, was his objection to DNA evidence introduced at trial which 'did not comply with industry standards.And he also accused Lanez original lawyer, Mgdesyan, of being 'ineffective counsel.' 'He didn't even meet with his own DNA expert before he tool the stand,' said Baez Monday.\u00a0",
        "In earlier written arguments, Baez also pointed out that while jurors listened to an 80-minute taped interview Harris gave to cops in which she blamed Lanez for the shooting, on the witness stand later at trial, she recanted much of what she said in that interview.And he blasted Mgdesyan for not objecting stronger to the tape being played to the jury.'I don't know how an attorney sits idly by and allows that to happen,' said Baez, who described the case as a 'jumbled, bungled mess.'Lanez's legal team claimed the District Attorney violated California's new 'Decriminalizing Artistic Expression Act' which restricts prosecutors' use of song lyrics and other forms of 'creative expression' from being used as criminal evidence against a defendant.Baez accused the prosecution of breaching that new law \u2013 even though it was only enacted after Lanez was convicted \u2013 by letting jurors see a photo of a shirtless Lanez showing the tattoo of an AK-47 gun on his chest and also by threatening to reveal some of his violent rap song lyrics if he chose to testify in his own defense.Lanez did not take the stand, a decision he now, reportedly, regrets.Prosecutors 'painted defendant as a gun-wielding career criminal leading jurors to 'improper consideration of criminal propensity based on his 'gansta' rapper persona', Baez maintained.",
        "A third defense attorney, Christine Benavente, lashed out at prosecutors for introducing at trial the photo showing Lanez's gun tattoo and testimony from Megan Thee Stallion about seeing a Lanez video in which he is seen 'butchering a horse leg.''The picture places racial bias into the proceeding,' she said Monday, adding that prosecutors were trying to create the impression among jurors that 'because he's a black rapper, he's guilty of the crime.'DDA Bott, who successfully prosecuted Lanez at trial, countered, saying the use of the photo showing Lanez's gun tattoo was only for identification purposes.\u00a0",
        "In a written challenge to the motion, Bott scoffed at Lanez's plea for a new trial, describing the evidence against him as 'overwhelming' and saying that the defense has 'failed to cite a single instance of error in the trial court.'On December 23 last year, the last day of Lanez's 10-day trial, there was chaos in the packed LA courtroom when the verdict was announced,Amid raucous protests \u2013 particularly from Lanez's father, Sonstar Peterson \u2013 he was found guilty of all the charges he faced over the shooting of Megan.After a day and a half of deliberations, the jury of seven women and five men unanimously convicted Lanez of three felonies: assault with a semi-automatic firearm, shooting a firearm in a grossly negligent manner and carrying a concealed firearm in a vehicle.",
        "The assault carries a penalty of up to nine years in jail, the conviction for negligently shooting a gun up to three years and the concealed gun count three years.But because the jury also found that Lanez caused 'great bodily injury' \u2013 Megan had three bullet fragments surgically removed from her feet \u2013 the assault and negligent shooting felonies carry enhanced penalties that could add up to six years to his sentence.The musician had pleaded not guilty to all three charges.In her emotional testimony during trial, Megan, 28, told the jury that she and Lanez \u2013 with whom she'd been having a sexual relationship \u2013 had been to a pool party July 12, 2020 at the home of Kylie Jenner and were in his SUV in the Hollywood Hills with Kelsey Harris when an alcohol-fueled argument erupted.Megan \u2013 real name Megan Pete \u2013 asked the driver to stop the car and she got out \u2013 which was when she said Lanez yelled 'Dance b\u2014ch' and fired a gun five times at her, injuring her feet so seriously that she needed surgery.She testified in court that Lanez offered her and Harris a million dollars to keep quiet about the shooting and asked them not to report him because he was already 'on probation.'Megan also said that Lanez later apologized to her, saying he was drunk at the time of the shooting."
