She has not yet addressed her daughter's sentence.'Last night, my daughter was arrested in Boston, Massachusetts,' Clark wrote on Twitter.\u00a0'I love Riley, and this is a very difficult time in the cycle of joy and pain in parenting. This will be evaluated by the legal system, and I am confident in that process.'\u00a0About 20 protestors surrounded cops while Dowell was arrested with some shouted profanity through megaphones.The protest led to traffic coming to a complete stop as participants created a scene on the sidewalk, police said.\u00a0",
