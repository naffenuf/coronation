        "Small business will be able to claim green energy on taxThis is starting the day after generous ute tax break ends\u00a0Australians who run a business will soon be able to claim a $20,000 tax break if they buy more efficient fridges or link their heating and cooling to solar energy.",
        "This looks set to replace\u00a0the instant asset write-off scheme where a tradie can buy a ute worth up $64,741 and claim it back on tax in one year rather than eight.With this program - known as 'temporary full expensing program' set to end on June 30 - Treasurer Jim Chalmers, Climate Change Minister Chris Bowen and Small Business Minister Julie Collins have announced a new tax break beginning on July 1.Small businesses will be able to link their heating and cooling to solar energy, upgrade to more energy-efficient fridges and induction cooktops and install batteries and heat pumps.H&amp;R Block director of tax communications Mark Chapman said the small business energy incentive\u00a0would allow firms to claim $20,000 on tax but depreciate it over the life of the item.'Based on current law, expenses on these kinds of items will need to be depreciated over a number of years,' he told Daily Mail Australia.",
        "The green energy would have to be installed or first used between July 1, 2023 and June 30, 2024.\u00a0This program is expected to cost $314 million over three years and help 3.8million small and medium-sized businesses.Small businesses with a turnover of less than $50million will also be eligible for an additional 20 per cent deduction for spending on energy efficiency and electrification, where there is a switch to renewable energy.",
        "'This scheme gives businesses \u2013 in addition to the usual write-off of the cost of the assets \u2013 the chance to claim an extra 20 per cent tax deduction in relation to the cost,' Mr Chapman said.'Therefore, if you spend $10,000 on the asset, you can actually write off $12,000.'",
        "Businesses can already claim items like computers or machinery as a tax deduction, provided they claim it over the life of the item.The outgoing instant asset write-off program - known as temporary full expensing - debuted in October 2020 during the early months of the pandemic.Former Liberal treasurer Josh Frydenberg extended it until June 30, 2023 in the 2021 Budget, allowing the cost of a ute to be claimed over one year rather than eight.The threshold was initially set at $59,136 but that rose to $64,741 with inflation.EXCLUSIVE: The huge tax blow that's going to see tradies and small businesses across Australia pay more ... and why it's going to spark a rush on utes: 'Paying a lot more'Tradies will soon lose the right to instantly write off their utes as small businesses pay more tax under a significant Budget change due to kick in within weeks.\u00a0Treasurer Jim Chalmers has given no hint the former Coalition government's instant asset write-off measures will be extended in the May 9 federal Budget.\u00a0Under those measures - formally known as 'temporary full expensing' - tradies can claim the whole cost of a work ute or van on tax in one year, rather than over eight.",
        "The cost of a vehicle is now capped at $64,741 - which covers Australia's two bestsellers, the Toyota HiLux and Ford Ranger.\u00a0The tax arrangements also allowed businesses with a turnover of up to $5billion a year to claim the cost of office equipment like furniture and computers upfront in one year - with an unlimited threshold.That also applied to tools and machinery.\u00a0",
        "Tradies who buy a ute or a van for work by June 30, 2023 can claim the entire cost on tax in one year rather than eight.The instant asset write-off - also known as 'temporary full expensing -\u00a0 was extended in the May 2021 budget under former Liberal treasurer Josh Frydenberg.The threshold stands at $64,741 for a work-related vehicle until the program ends.The instant asset write-off also also a business with a turnover of up to $5billion to claim the cost of office equipment like computers and furniture in one year rather than over the life of the asset.\u00a0From July 1, small businesses with a turnover of up to $10million will only be able to instantly claim in one year items worth up to $1,000.\u00a0",
        "H&amp;R Block director of tax communications Mark Chapman said the end of the instant asset write-off arrangements on June 30 would see small businesses pay a lot more tax.",
        "'Many businesses are going to be paying much more tax upfront - they'll still get the tax relief but it will be spread across several years,' he told Daily Mail Australia.'It will make an enormous difference to cash flow - going forward, if you acquire a capital asset, you need to write that off over the course of its effective life.'The temporary full expensing program would revert to a 'far less generous instant asset write-off'.'It's due to expire on 30 June, 2023 and there are no indications that the Treasurer plans to extend it, let alone make it permanent - as many business groups have called for,' Mr Chapman said.Instead, under current plans, from July 1,\u00a0small business owners with a turnover of less than $10million will be able to immediately write off the cost of assets costing less than $1,000.\u00a0Above that level, items have to be claimed over the life they are used in the business, which can range from three years for a computer to several decades for major production machinery.'A big comedown from all businesses being able to write off all asset purchases,' Mr Chapman said.But with gross government debt approaching $1trillion in 2023-24, and inflation on the high side, Dr Chalmers would be unlikely to continue the generous provisions of the instant asset write-off in the May 9 Budget.",
        "'The level of government debt, absolutely, is a factor,' Mr Chapman said.\u00a0'With the focus on challenging inflation and keeping the domestic economy in robust shape to deal with a worldwide downturn, the focus is likely to be on targeted spending to help the most vulnerable groups.'Shadow treasurer Angus Taylor called on Labor to keep the instant asset write-off arrangements.'The instant asset write off has supported hundreds of thousands of businesses to invest in productivity, helped new businesses find their footing, and existing businesses to ride out tough times,' he told Daily Mail Australia.'Labor flagged its plan to end these tax measures which support investment, innovation, and small businesses at a time when they need it most.'Mr Chapman said the instant asset write-off scheme was a lifeline during the worst days of the pandemic.\u00a0'In terms of helping small businesses during the pandemic, the temporary full expensing write-off was absolutely vital - from an economic perspective, it was tremendous at keeping all businesses really afloat during the pandemic,' he said.Ute sales have been increasing during the past year, despite 10 interest rate rises from the Reserve Bank of Australia that have taken the cash rate to an 11-year high of 3.6 per cent.\u00a0The Toyota HiLux was Australia's No. 1 seller in March, with 4,583 ordered, followed by\u00a04,508 for the Ford Ranger and\u00a02,789 for the Isuzu D-MAX.",
        "Mr Chapman said the $64,741 threshold was designed to stop small business owners from buying a luxury car.",
        "'That threshold\u00a0is there to stop taxpayers going out and buying lavish vehicles for their business\u00a0 - they didn't want to encourage people to go out and buy a BMW when a Ford or a Honda would do,' he said.From July 1, the vehicle threshold would be indexed to inflation - taking it to $69,144 under the present 6.8 per cent inflation rate for February - but this would have to be claimed back over eight years rather than one.\u00a0Small business owners hoping to buy a ute for work purposes, so they can claim it back on tax, had to contend with longer waiting times due to car production delays, but these delays have eased during the past year.Dr Chalmers did not respond to a request for comment last week.\u00a0But Mr Taylor on March 28 said the lack of certainty was bad for small business.'Australians are right to be wondering what Labor will do next,' he told the House of Representatives.'Small-business owners were shocked to see it buried in last year's budget when those opposite were ending the extension of the instant asset write-off.\u00a0",
        "'This is a big deal for small businesses. If that is the government's version of refining the tax system, we should all be deeply worried.'In the 2021-22 Budget, Treasury put the cost of the instant asset write-off and the loss carry back provision - where a business could claim losses against profits in previous financial years - at $20.7billion over three years.\u00a0In his May 2021 Budget speech, Mr Frydenberg had declared the extension of the tax measures until June 30, 2023 meant 'a tradie can buy a new ute, a farmer a new harvester and a manufacturer expand their production line'.William\u00a0Laird, a Toowoomba-based agribusiness specialist and a director of accounting group RSM Australia, said supply constraints had made it hard for farmers to have taken advantage of the instant asset write-off.'The sector was hopeful of an extension to the instant asset write-off, however the Budget failed to address this measure and so it is likely to finish up in 2023 as planned,' he told Farmonline."
