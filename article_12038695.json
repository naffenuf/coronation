She knew!'.Explaining how her friend had designed the dress, Mel said: 'It was quite embarrassing, actually, because I didn't realise the medal goes here on your chest.She continued: 'Victoria [Beckham] designed my dress for the occasion. And she put a big slit right there.\u00a0 And I was like \"Oh, sorry!\"'",
        "Mel was awarded her MBE (The Most Excellent Order of the British Empire) for services to charitable causes and vulnerable women.\u00a0The singer also revealed how Prince William had begged her for a Spice Girls reunion.She said: 'He asked, \"Will you get the Spice Girls back together?\".

        "Mel added that her and Prince William had chatted about her work on domestic violence, with her calling it a 'very special moment for me'.\u00a0"
