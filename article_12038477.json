        "Police are investigating after a Just Stop Oil protester appeared to have been injured by a car which ran over their foot.",
        "The incident happened at the latest slow march by the group, which has been happening every day for two weeks across London.In a video posted to Twitter, an activist holding a Just Stop Oil banner and wearing an orange high-vis jacket is seen standing in Holloway Road in Islington, north London, in front of a grey Renault, before falling down on to the street.Two other activists are seen helping the injured campaigner, with one repeatedly asking \u201care you all right?\u201d and the other saying \u201cit\u2019s gone over her foot, it\u2019s gone over her foot\u201d.A fourth Just Stop Oil supporter then calls out the driver\u2019s licence plate using a megaphone.A spokesman for Just Stop Oil told the PA news agency that they received \u201ca lot of support and encouragement\u201d from people who witnessed the incident.",
        "\u201cAfter weeks of inflammatory language from politicians and right-wing media personalities, a car has finally rammed into a peaceful protester,\u201d the group said.\u201cWe understand that the supporter in question is doing OK, and as far as we know has not required medical assistance.\u201cWe will get off the road when the Government makes a meaningful statement to end new oil and gas.\u201dDeputy chairman of the Conservative Party Lee Anderson clashed with Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley over the force\u2019s handling of the protests when he appeared before the Commons Home Affairs Committee on Wednesday.",
        "Mr Anderson told Sir Mark to \u201cleave his ivory tower\u201d to deal with protesters in Westminster, and he wrongly said the activists could be arrested for obstructing the highway.Sir Mark said he was \u201cmaking selective comments based on a partial understanding of the law\u201d, adding: \u201cThe law is very clear that protest is disruptive, and to a certain extent, that is allowed.\u201dScotland Yard said in a statement: \u201cPolice are appealing for witnesses and dash cam footage after a person was involved in a collision with a vehicle on Holloway Road, Islington, whilst engaged in a protest, at around 10am, today Tuesday May 2.\u201cThe incident was brought to police attention after being circulated on social media and shows the person being involved in collision with a grey Renault Megane.\u201cIf you were the person or have any information about the incident please report by calling 101, tweeting @MetCC or online at www.met.police.uk.\u201dSlow marches are a disruptive but legal form of protest that the police have little power to break up.However, a number of marchers were removed from roads near Parliament Square on Tuesday after police issued Section 12 conditions, which allows officers to stop public processions where there is a risk of \u201cserious public disorder\u201d.Metropolitan Police Commander Karen Findlay, who leads the force on public order policing, earlier tweeted: \u201cWe are aware of a further two groups of Just Stop Oil protestors slow marching in Parliament Square (different group to previous one) and Grosvenor Square. Police are on scene. Sec 12 conditions and directions to get immediately onto the pavement issued.\u201d",
        "Just Stop Oil has been obstructing roads in central London as part of its slow march campaign, launched on Monday April 24, to \u201cdemand an end to new UK oil and gas projects\u201d.The Met Police said there have not been any arrests in connection with these protests.The force said it \u201cattended several sporadic demonstrations across central London by Just Stop Oil\u201d on Tuesday, adding that \u201cpolice continue to monitor the situation and are ready to act should further protests by Just Stop Oil occur\u201d."
