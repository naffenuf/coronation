        "Mail Sport understands that Jurgen Klopp was keen on keeping the 37-year-old as he rebuilds his midfield.The veteran has featured in 27 Premier league games this season but only six of those have been starts.His minutes have dwindled as the season has gone on and his last top-flight start came over two months ago at Crystal Palace.",
        "Speaking in January, Klopp signaled his intention to keep working with Milner beyond the summer.'We have different plans for Milly but Milly wants to keep playing,' said Klopp. 'When you see him play the other night I think everyone understands that. You can't judge him normal for his age. He is 37, doesn't look a day like this when he is in training.",
        "'He is an incredibly important player and in this game (Wolves) you saw on the pitch as well. It is not that Milly expects to play 64 games a season but in 64 games a season Milly could be extremely important. That is how it is. Milly has reached 600 games and most of them for Liverpool.'There might be more fancy players out there but no one with a similar mind-set and that makes him incredibly valuable for us. And it is not because I am too loyal. It is just a fact.'\u00a0"
