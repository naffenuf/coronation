        "Another positive factor for the peso is the refusal by lawmakers to move forward with a tax overhaul devised by the government of President Gabriel Boric to finance reforms in pension and health care systems.Similarly, technical and political challenges could postpone for years any advance in Boric's idea to nationalize the Chilean lithium industry, which holds the world's largest reserves of the metal.The central bank's move last month to start reducing its forward dollar sales operations program \"is quite gradual in nature, and we think it should have limited impact once the news is absorbed,\" Barclays said.In contrast, the outlook for Argentina's peso continues to worsen, facing an additional 50% depreciation to 450 per U.S. dollar in one year in the heavily-regulated official market as the economy teeters on the edge of a deeper crisis.In Brazil, sentiment towards President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's fiscal plans remains broadly neutral, with the Brazilian real seen trading 2.0% weaker at 5.14 per dollar in one year compared to 5.04 on Tuesday.In Mexico, the peso is set to drop 6.7% in 12 months to 19.25 per dollar from 17.96 this week, reflecting a correction for inflation. Year-to-date it has gained 8.4%, while the real is up 4.9%, the Chilean peso 4.6% and the Argentine peso down 21%.",
