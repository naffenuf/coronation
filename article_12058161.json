        "The Eurovision Song Contest is widely known for its fiendishly complex voting system.",
        "To make things more complicated, the European Broadcasting Union, which produces the competition, has made some tweaks for the 2023 edition.\u2013 Here is how it works:Viewers from all participating countries will be invited to vote for their favourite songs on the night of the grand finale on Saturday May 13.Fans can vote over the phone, by text or via the Eurovision app.Each person can vote up to 20 times but voters will be unable to select their own country\u2019s entry.",
        "The public votes make up 50% of the total vote, with the other half determined by a professional jury in each participating country.The experts\u2019 scores are based on the Friday night jury final performances, which are not usually televised.After viewers have cast their votes, a national spokesperson from the participating countries will be called in to present the points of their professional jury \u2013 which range from the maximum \u201cdouze points\u201d (12) to zero.After the presentation of the scores from the juries, the public points from all participating countries will be combined, providing one score for each song.\u2013 What has changed this year?As of 2023, only viewers\u2019 votes will decide which countries qualify onwards from the semi-finals stage.This means that acts will not have to face the judges until they reach the grand final stage.",
        "For the first time in the competition\u2019s nearly seven-decade history, people from countries outside the contest will be able to vote online and on the app.Their votes will be converted into points that will have the same weight as one participating country in both of the semi-finals and the grand final."
