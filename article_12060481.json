        "Carlos Corberan expressed his pride at turning around West Brom\u2019s season despite a 3-2 final-day loss at Swansea as they fell short of the Sky Bet Championship play-offs.",
        "West Brom had started the final day of the regular season as play-off outsiders, needing to beat Swansea and hope for favourable results elsewhere.The Baggies ultimately finished ninth, as Sunderland and Coventry claimed the final two play-off places, after Corberan took over in October with the club second bottom of the Championship.\u201cThe target we had was difficult, to change the momentum of the season,\u201d said Corberan, whose side won only three of their final 10 games.\u201cIt was very uncomfortable. We moved fast, we focused on the possibilities and I feel very proud.\u201cIt\u2019s a pity we didn\u2019t achieve the play-off positions, but the team has put in a lot of effort.",
        "\u201cWe arrived to the last moment of the competition and the players did not stop to believe, to try and make their best.\u201dOn summer squad strengthening, Corberan added: \u201cI do not know the limitations or the situation (of the club), but from tomorrow I will guarantee to work as in football there is no time to waste.\u201cAs fast as we know our possibilities and resources the better for us to play the team that West Bromwich needs to have.\u201dCorberan was unhappy with Swansea\u2019s stoppage-time winner, Joel Piroe curling home a free-kick for his 20th goal of the season.",
        "He said: \u201cI am very disappointed that we didn\u2019t get something from the game, at least a point.\u201cI don\u2019t think we deserved a defeat with all the things we have done well, especially in the second half.\u201cWe should avoid a foul where we concede the free-kick but there was a foul on (Jayson) Molumby. That increases the frustration.\u201dSwansea, for whom Luke Cundle and Olivier Ntcham cancelled out goals from Okay Yokuslu and Semi Ajayi, finished below West Brom on goal difference in 10th.Fresh investment is arriving at the Welsh club this summer and new chairman Andy Coleman\u2019s in-tray will include tying manager Russell Martin down to a new contract.Martin, appointed Swansea manager in August 2021, has one year left on his current deal and has been linked with a potential summer vacancy at Leicester.\u201cHe (Coleman) said he likes what we\u2019re doing,\u201d said Martin. \u201cThere\u2019s maybe other priorities at the moment but we\u2019ll see.\u201cHe\u2019s said the ownership group have expressed an interest in trying to extend the contract.\u201cWe\u2019ve got guys out of contract, so that\u2019s got to be a real priority.\u201cWhatever comes first, I don\u2019t know. We\u2019ll just have to wait and see.\u201d"
