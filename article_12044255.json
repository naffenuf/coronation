        "Pep Guardiola said \u201cspecial striker\u201d Erling Haaland richly deserved the guard of honour by his Manchester City team-mates after breaking the Premier League single-season scoring record.",
        "The 22-year-old has made a mockery of those doubting whether he could repeat his goalscoring feats after last summer\u2019s switch from Borussia Dortmund to the Etihad Stadium.Haaland took his tally to 51 in all competitions on Wednesday night, when his cool finish moved his Premier League haul on to 35 and broke Andy Cole and Alan Shearer\u2019s competition record.The Norway international scored between Nathan Ake and Phil Foden\u2019s efforts in a 3-0 win against West Ham that was followed by what Guardiola says was a pre-planned guard of honour.",
        "\u201cIt was (special), I think he deserved it,\u201d the City boss said. \u201cAll the team deserved it because without the team he couldn\u2019t do it, but he is a special striker.\u201cWe are very pleased for him because he is a joy, not just to work with him as a manager. I think everyone is happy to have him with us.\u201cOf course this record will be broken sooner or later, maybe by him in the future or maybe another one but they\u2019ll have to score a lot of goals because he scored a lot.\u201cOf course (we planned the guard of honour). We thought about that and in football when there is a special occasion, we have to show how special it is.",
        "\u201cToday it was with Erling. Another one, another day will happen but of course to score and overcome the position of Andy Cole and Alan Shearer \u2013 incredible, top, top strikers \u2013 is special.\u201d",
        "Guardiola said \u201cwe cannot achieve many things without a good striker\u201d, namechecking previous City frontmen like Sergio Aguero, Gabriel Jesus, Edin Dzeko and Mario Balotelli.But this night was all about Haaland, who still has five Premier League matches to increase his eye-watering record even further.\u201cAt the end when you buy a player in Erling we know he score goals everywhere and we thought he could do it (here),\u201d Guardiola said.\u201cBut at the end we don\u2019t know. You have to work and see the process.\u201cHe understands what we want to do, the players understand his movement and whatever, so a question of time.\u201cThe impact or how he adjusted to the league was so quick.\u201cThe first two goals was against West Ham. It\u2019s a coincidence as he breaks the record against West Ham when he scored the first goals against them.\u201cImmediately we saw he is a guy when you provide him with balls, he scores in all situations \u2013 except free kicks, but maybe in the future.\u201cBut penalties, crosses, combinations and transitions, he is a guy who can do many, many things. That\u2019s why he scored a lot of goals.\u201d",
        "Haaland\u2019s latest goal helped calm any nerves at the Etihad Stadium, with Wednesday\u2019s victory seeing title favourites City usurp Arsenal and reclaim top spot.\u201cI said after Arsenal (last week) when everybody said it\u2019s over, I said it was not over in my press conference,\u201d Guardiola said of the 4-1 win last midweek.\u201cYesterday Arsenal proved it. They will not give up. I know quite well Mikel (Arteta), how competitive he is and I know a few players.\u201cArsenal is one of the historical teams and they will be there. I said to the players.\u201dAs for West Ham, the 3-0 defeat came on a night when illness ruled out Declan Rice, Nayef Aguerd and Tomas Soucek on the day of the game.David Moyes, whose side face Manchester United on Sunday, said: \u201cI have got to hope they are (back).\u201cTwo of them we\u2019re not sure if it\u2019s maybe a bit of food poisoning they\u2019ve picked up whether at the training ground or hotel.\u201cOne of them we think has got a virus, so, I\u2019m not a doctor, whether antibiotics fix that not quickly or how you work it I\u2019m not quite sure.\u201cSo, hopefully they\u2019ll have a chance for the weekend but I think the biggest thing I have to praise the players who came in and did such a good job.",
        "\u201cFor long periods against a really good team we made it quite difficult\u201d"
