        "\"It is safe to say the last 10 months have been difficult as I dealt with a recurring injury to a bone of both hands,\" Raducanu said on Twitter.\"I'm having a minor procedure done on both hands to resolve the issues. I'm disappointed to share that I will be out for the next few months and while I am at it will have another minor procedure that is due on my ankle.\" (Reporting by Simon Jennings in Bengaluru, editing by Mitch Phillips)"
