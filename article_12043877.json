        "At a sponsorship event for the luxury watch company, Hamilton was spotted on a branded court with a large sign of the driver behind one of the hoops.Joining him at this event were other IWC-sponsored celebrities - including Hollywood actors James Marsden and Simu Liu.The event took over\u00a0Jungle Plaza in the Florida city, inviting basketball fans to participate in a clinic with professional basketball coaches and then compete in our Free Throw Challenge.The Mercedes driver appeared to be participating in a challenge of his own as he teamed up with Marsden and NFL star\u00a0Antrel Rolle to take on skateboarder Jagger Eaton, Brandon Okpalobi and\u00a0Liu.\u00a0",
        "Hamilton is preparing for the 2023 Miami Grand Prix - the second year that the race has been held at the Miami International Autodrome.It's been a season of struggles for the seven time World Champion - who remains steadfast in his search for an eighth crown - as he's failed to finish atop the podium so far.Hamilton's last victory in Formula One came all the way back at the 2021 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix - before a controversial decision at the final race of the season in Abu Dhabi cost him an eighth crown.While he couldn't find wins last season, he still managed multiple podium finishes - including five P2 results and four P3 finishes. That led to him finishing the year in sixth position.",
        "This season looks on track to be more of the same for the British racing legend - with only the only podium finish to his name so far coming with a P2 in Australia.He finished P5 in the first two rounds of the season at Bahrain and Jeddah in Saudi Arabia before finishing P6 in Azerbaijan.",

        "Additionally, Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff said that Ferrari's golden boy Charles Leclerc is 'on [our] radar'. But Wolff has also said that he isn't willing to speak to other drivers or form a 'Plan B' if Hamilton departs.Unlike Hamilton's current deal, Leclerc's contract runs until the end of the 2024 season.",
        "The pair will face off against the rest of the field in Miami Gardens this weekend - with Hamilton sitting fourth in the driver's championship and Leclerc in sixth.It's an event that Leclerc won pole at last season, but he only managed a P3 finish behind Perez and Verstappen.\u00a0"
