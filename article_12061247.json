So I've been full pelt training with that. I've just been knuckling down with my training, and hopefully get a fight date soon.",
        "'I love the training so that's half the battle. But the discipline, obviously I'm eating clean, cutting out the alcohol, and not going out, but that's just part and parcel - you just have to get on with it. Once I have my first fight, I'll be allowed to then.'",
        "And could Liam see himself fighting fellow former Love Island star Tommy Fury in the future?\u00a0'If he came up loads and loads of weights, he said: 'We are different weights, but that's the thing for me now, finding an opponent my size.'Tommy is a lot lighter than me, but yeah, one day if he wants to crack on, then great. Tommy is doing well, so fair play to him. He had a great fight with Jake Paul.'We've never actually spoken before. I've never actually met Tommy, but he seems to be doing well, so fair play to him.'"
