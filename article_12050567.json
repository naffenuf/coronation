        "Eddie Howe has admitted Newcastle will have to unearth future superstars before they hit the headlines after playing down links with Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar.",
        "The high-flying Magpies have found themselves at the centre of speculation over big-money moves ever since Amanda Staveley\u2019s Saudi-backed consortium completed its takeover at St James\u2019 Park in October 2021.Newcastle, in which Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund holds an 80 per cent stake, have invested in excess of \u00a3250million in new players in the last three transfer windows, but have been touted as contenders to land both Portuguese giant Ronaldo and Brazilian counterpart Neymar in recent days.",
        "Asked about the prospect of some of the best players in the world one day plying their trade on Tyneside, head coach Howe \u2013 who has persistently cited financial fair play as a limiting factor on the club\u2019s recruitment plans \u2013 said: \u201cIt is best to discover them before they explode onto the world scene.\u201cWe could not be able to come close to affording those players as they are the best players in the world.\u201cWe are never going to be in a position currently to afford those transfer fees and wages, so we need to go underneath and find them young and develop them into the players they can be.\u201dThe Magpies\u2019 business to date has been shrewd with the likes of Nick Pope and Kieran Trippier having arrived for relatively modes fees before more sizeable investment in Bruno Guimaraes, Sven Botman, Alexander Isak and Anthony Gordon.",
        " Financially, we can't recruit that way at the moment, but also we have to bring the right people and the right players into the group.  Newcastle head coach Eddie Howe  But, having guided the club into third place in the Premier League table ahead of Sunday\u2019s showdown with title-chasing Arsenal, Howe knows it is inevitable they will be linked with bigger names.Asked about Ronaldo and Neymar, he said: \u201cThat kind of speculation has been there from day one since the takeover, really. Naturally everyone has then assumed the biggest names in world football will be going to Newcastle.\u201cNow we\u2019ve not recruited that way. Financially, we can\u2019t recruit that way at the moment, but also we have to bring the right people and the right players into the group.\u201cI will say the transfer market is such a complex decision, you can\u2019t just pick a name and bring them in. There\u2019s got to be a lot of thought going into what we\u2019re doing both financially and looking at the players.\u201d",
        "\u201cThose two players are unbelievable players. We are linked with different names.\u201cI know what direction I want to take the team in and what we can and can\u2019t do in the transfer market.\u201dHowe\u2019s comments came amid reports that Lionel Messi could command a \u00a3320million a year package \u2013 \u00a315million more than Staveley and her partners paid for Newcastle \u2013 if he opts to move to Saudi Arabia\u2019s Pro League this summer."
