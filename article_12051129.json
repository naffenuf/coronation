        "ROME, May 5 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank's interest rates may be nearing the level required to control inflation, a policymaker said on Friday, adding that the peak expected by markets \"is an important reference point\" for the central bank.The ECB raised its key deposit rate by 25 basis points on Thursday, bringing the benchmark for borrowing costs in the 20-country euro zone to 3.25%.Asked what level the central bank wants to reach before stopping the rate hikes, Ignazio Visco, the governor of the Bank of Italy, said: \"It is perhaps not too far from where we are today.\"Visco, who is a member of the ECB's governing council, was speaking at a presentation of his latest book in Rome.Money market prices show investors expect another 25-basis-point increase in the deposit rate next month, which would take it to 3.50%, but are less convinced the ECB will hike again after that.The interest rate peak, or \"terminal rate,\" is currently priced in at 3.65%, likely meaning that most investors expect the ECB to raise the deposit rate to 3.75%, though a sizeable minority see it peaking at 3.50%.The ECB is then expected to start cutting rates as soon as early next year.On Thursday, all ECB policymakers except Austria's Robert Holzmann agreed to slow the pace of rate increases while signalling more hikes ahead, sources told Reuters, with some seeing two or three further rises in borrowing costs.",
        "\"In the future, monetary policy can only be going towards higher rates with caution,\" Visco said, adding that it was currently being transmitted into the economy in an \"energetic way\". (Reporting by Giselda Vagnoni; editing by Gavin Jones, Alvise Armellini and Paul Simao)"
