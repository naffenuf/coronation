        "When asked on the red carpet about their relationship status, Diddy simply said she was his date for the night.'She's my date for the night. \u2026 We don't put titles on it. Everybody wants us to put a title on it, we don't put titles,' he said.'This like my best friend in the world, one of the most beautiful people God has blessed me with. And I'm blessed that she's my date tonight,' he added.'We were f***ing with each other hard. We were together every day at one point. He supported me, I supported him. I'll let the internet call it whatever they want to call it,' she added."
