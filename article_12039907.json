        "A new Bill proposes a pilot scheme that aims to drive up the conviction rateLord Uist called the plans a 'serious attack upon independence of the judiciary\u2019Plans for juryless rape trials and moves to allow judges to be summarily sacked are \u2018repugnant\u2019 and potentially unlawful, a former judge has said.",
        "Lord Uist warned that the proposals \u2013 published by Justice Secretary Angela Constance last week \u2013 were a \u2018serious attack upon the independence of the judiciary\u2019.A new Bill proposes a pilot scheme of juryless rape trials as part of changes aimed at driving up the conviction rate, including abolishing the not proven verdict.Writing in Scottish Legal News, Lord Uist said: \u2018The work of the pilot courts is to be subject to review by the executive [Government] and a report of that review is to be submitted to the legislature. This amounts to politicians treating the courts as forensic laboratories in which to experiment with their policies.\u2019Lord Uist said the SNP Government had said the \u2018main purpose of the review is to consider whether the work of the court has been acceptable to the executive in the percentage of convictions returned by it\u2019. He added: \u2018A court with a limited lifespan working under such constraints could not be considered an independent tribunal within the meaning of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights.\u2019",
        "The former judge attacked the power the Bill provides for the Lord President to dismiss judges from the proposed Sexual Offences Court \u2013 without giving a reason. Referring to both proposals, Lord Uist wrote: \u2018It is shocking that they were ever included in the Bill. Consideration should be given to removing them from the Bill.\u2019",
        "Scottish Tory justice spokesman Jamie Greene said: \u2018Lord Uist has delivered the latest damning verdict on the SNP\u2019s plans for juryless trials from within the legal sector. Any reforms must have the buy-in of the sector.\u2019Ms Constance said: \u2018The Bill will be debated in detail and of course scrutinised \u2013 I hope \u2013 to the very highest of standards.\u2019The Scottish Government said: \u2018The evidence that jurors are subject to preconceptions about rape is overwhelming.\u2019"
