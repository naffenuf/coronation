        "TSB has issued a warning on the scale of social media scams taking place through services such as Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, as the bank says a significant proportion of the cases it sees have been coming through these platforms.",
        "The bank said that its own internal data indicates scams that come through these Meta-owned companies account for around 80% of fraud cases within the three biggest fraud categories at TSB.TSB analysed its customer fraud data from January 2021 to December 2022 to make the findings. The data relates to cases where the platform has been recorded.Purchase, impersonation and investment fraud are the three biggest fraud categories at TSB by case load/volume.TSB fraud experts are urging people to watch out for unsolicited messages claiming to be from family, or close friends. They advise contacting the person directly, if possible, before ever sending a payment.They are also urging potential investors to stick to recognised investment platforms and to steer clear of social media \u201cget-rich-quick\u201d schemes.",
        "TSB launched its own fraud refund guarantee in 2019 and it said 97% of fraud cases it sees are reimbursed through this.The guarantee covers customers who are innocent victims of fraud on their TSB account. Under the guarantee, customers are not reimbursed if, for example, they are found to have been involved in the fraud themselves or deemed to have abused the guarantee.Paul Davis, director of fraud prevention, TSB, said: \u201cSocial media companies must urgently clean up their platforms to protect the countless innocent people who use their services every day.",
