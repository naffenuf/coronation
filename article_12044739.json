It will be a wonderful and historic day.\u201d",
        "Mr Valei follows the royal family from Sao Paulo but considers them as part of his own family as he \u201cloves the legacy they carry\u201d.\u201cI like the royal family because first of all, they are a family,\u201d he said.\u201cI just love the legacy they carry \u2013 the royal genealogy, the history, the tradition, and I also enjoy following their lives and work.\u201cThey are like an extension of my own family.\u201cI\u2019ve followed them all these years, I celebrate the important dates and I\u2019m saddened by the deaths and family fights.\u201dMr Valei has \u201calways loved British history\u201d and first became interested in the royal family after the birth of Princess Charlotte, saying \u201cit was love at first sight\u201d.",

        "Among his favourite memorabilia pieces is a framed picture of a handwritten card and bouquet of white roses, placed in Hyde Park by his friends who live in London after Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s death last September.His message read: \u201cDear Queen Elizabeth, thank you for everything. Rest in peace. With love Savio Valei.\u201dThe card and flowers were a gift from Mr Valei and he asked his friends to capture a picture of them among the other tributes so he could hang the image on his wall to remember the late Queen.His bedroom is decorated from floor to ceiling with an array of memorabilia from magazines to dolls.Despite this dedicated space in his home, he admitted there is now little room to display everything.\u201cI have approximately 2,000 pieces, including books, magazines, mugs, dolls, tea tins, photos, replicas,\u201d he said.\u201cThe most expensive memorabilia I own is probably a Kate Middleton wedding doll \u2013 it\u2019s 50cm long and I still haven\u2019t found a suitable place to display it.\u201d",
        "As well as admiring the King, the lawyer also has great respect for the Queen Consort and said she is \u201can excellent Queen\u201d.\u201cCharles has been preparing for many years to be King, so I\u2019d say he is more than fit for this supreme role,\u201d he said.\u201cCamilla will also make an excellent Queen, she has earned my respect and admiration during these years of working for the royal family.\u201d"
