        "Arsenal have been hit by yet another long-term injury blow with defender Laura Wienroither confirmed as having ruptured her anterior cruciate ligament against Wolfsburg on Monday.",
        "After coming off the bench midway through the second half of the Women\u2019s Champions League semi-final leg at the Emirates Stadium, Wienroither then had to be substituted due to injury in the 82nd second minute.A statement from Arsenal on Thursday said the Austria international had suffered a ruptured ACL, adding: \u201cLaura will undergo surgery in due course and will be sidelined for an extended period.\u201cEveryone at the club will now be supporting Laura and working hard to support her recovery and return to action.\u201dIt is Arsenal\u2019s fourth ACL injury of the season \u2013 after Leah Williamson, Beth Mead and Vivianne Miedema \u2013 and skipper Kim Little was ruled out for the rest of the campaign in March by a hamstring issue.",
        "Miedema later shared a message of support for her fellow injured team-mates, posting on Instagram: \u201cAt least we will all be in the gym together. PS the ACL group is full now. Please no more.\u201dWienroither herself wrote on Instagram: \u201cI\u2019m going to miss every single second of not being on the pitch with this special team.\u201cI\u2019ll fight like hell to return as soon as I\u2019m ready to get back to following my dream in red and white. Until that time, I\u2019m Arsenal and Austria\u2019s biggest fan.\u201d",
        "At a press conference ahead of Friday\u2019s Women\u2019s Super League clash with Leicester, Arsenal boss Jonas Eidevall said the news was \u201ca tragedy for the player and for us as a team\u201d.Asked why he thought Arsenal had had so many ACL injuries this season, Eidevall said: \u201cThat\u2019s what we need to look into, obviously, and I\u2019m afraid there\u2019s not just one single answer.\u201cIt\u2019s a multi-faceted injury, and we need to look at the complete picture and to see what factors in this can we control, what can we learn and what can we do better. Of course we need to look at that internally, and hopefully we\u2019ll be better in the future.\u201cThen there are things that we need to have external co-operation with \u2013 for example, the playing schedule, or the co-operation between clubs and national teams, or how and when the competitions are played and how the international match calendar is. That requires governing bodies, football associations, clubs and national teams working together.\u201cSo there are bits I think clubs can solve themselves internally, but there are also a lot of things that require the whole world of football to co-operate. So we need to do both.\u201dRegarding the internal side of things, he added: \u201cWe\u2019ve done it the last three years \u2013 this is an ongoing process, where we are constantly reviewing our injuries and benchmarking that. We continue to do that and that reflection, it\u2019s making us better for the future, I\u2019m sure of that.\u201d"
