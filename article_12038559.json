        "Artist Andrew Jamieson designed the official Coronation invitation, but he hasn\u2019t received one himself.\u00a0",
        "\u2018I don\u2019t see why I should,\u2019 he says. \u2018Many more deserving people have done amazing things for this country. I hope they have an incredible day.\u2019He says he was \u2018stunned\u2019 his design had been chosen by Buckingham Palace, and the result (top) was so impressive we asked him to design an exclusive handpainted version for Daily Mail readers \u2013 the glorious cover of today\u2019s Weekend magazine (inset).\u00a0The initial phone call came from the Art Workers\u2019 Guild \u2013 eight members had been asked to submit designs \u2013 and so began a month\u2019s painstaking work in secret at his home studio in Fife.Andrew, 61, grew up on a council estate in London, and recalls being excited as a boy when he saw illuminated manuscripts on visits to the British Museum.\u00a0",
        "He went on to study heraldic art, calligraphy and manuscript illumination at Reigate School of Art.His concept for the royal invitation included a wildflower meadow and a Green Man motif \u2013 a pagan symbol of spring and rebirth \u2013 to mark the new reign.\u00a0\u2018It seemed to go down well and Their Majesties gave me free rein.\u2019Like the King\u2019s, our illustration is packed with flowers. \u2018The rose, thistle and shamrock are all royal plants and make up the royal badge of the King,\u2019 says Andrew.\u00a0",
        "\u2018Normally a leek is shown as the emblem of Wales but I thought the daffodil more colourful and appropriate.\u2019\u00a0Also in the meadow border are dog roses, cornflowers, bluebells, violets, forget-me-nots and wild strawberries.He made a few tweaks for us. The architectural arch suggests the abbey \u2013 it\u2019s crowned with a lion crest, has two weather vanes with the letter \u2018C\u2019 on them, and a robin and a skylark sit on two of the pinnacles.\u00a0",
        "Through the window is Windsor Castle and at the bottom the two shields lean in towards each other, as is a custom in heraldry for marital shields.Playing among the flowers are a lion, a unicorn, a boar and a dragon, as well as a bee, a butterfly and a gold swallow.\u00a0Andrew has also included a sparrow \u2013 \u2018a tongue-in-cheek reference to my being a Cockney\u2019.So what will he be doing today? \u2018My wife and I will watch it on TV like everyone else,\u2019 he says. \u2018Being an American she\u2019ll turn it into a huge celebration!\u2019"
