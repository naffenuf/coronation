        "Follow all the latest royal news and updates on Coronation events on MailOnline's live blog here\u00a0Five-year-old Prince Louis operated a digger with his father today - while his older brother and sister watched with a hint of nerves - as the they led the nation on a day of volunteering to mark the Coronation.",
        "The young prince missed the Coronation\u00a0Concert last night because it was past his bedtime, but on his first ever official royal engagement he was operating a mini JCB as the family spruced up a Slough scout hut to support the Big Help Out.When the Prince of Wales took control of a digger, Louis jumped into his father's lap as William moved the mechanical arm and grabbed a bucket full of soil before dumping it on a heap. He looked fascinated as William worked the controls of the excavator.And it didn't end there, Kate was seen pushing a wheelbarrow while her youngest son shoveled in sand. He then took control, steering it expertly as his mum supported its weight. Louis also did some painting for a mural.When his work was done he devoured several toasted marshmallows.\u00a0Charlotte opted for a s'more - a gooey marshmallow in between two chocolate digestive biscuits.\u00a0When Louis spotted one going spare his father was heard declaring: 'You've made his day - you won't hear a peep out of him now' as he chomped away on the treat.Kate then revealed her affectionate nickname for her youngest son, calling him 'Lou-Bugs'.Charlotte was seen delightedly running to help prepare a new path while George, a future king himself, was spotted learning how to use a power drill. ",
        "All three young royals had a crack at archery - as did their parents - but while George did grab the controls of the digger, Charlotte appears to have declined.\u00a0The couple and their three children were out and about again to mark the third day of the King\u2019s Coronation, and Charles III's life of service.The Princess of Wales has been Joint President of the Scouts since 2020 and the royals joined volunteers resetting a path, digging a new soakaway, sanding and revarnishing the front door, adding planters to the front of the building and adding a mural to create a lasting legacy of the Big Help Out\u2019s work.\u00a0William and Kate, who were casually dressed, wore scarfs from the 3rd Upton Scout Group as they mingled with scouts and leaders taking part in The Big Help event \u2013 one of thousands across the country to mark the end of the coronation.Louis, five,\u00a0tried his hand at archery accompanied by his elder brother George, nine, and sister Charlotte, eight.Each fired an arrow tipped with a rubber suction pad at a target.Volunteer Beatriz Andrade said the junior members of the royal family all hit the target.William and Kate also took part in the mini archery contest.'They were very good, and seemed to have good fun,' she said.",
        "The three young royals were happy to toast marshmallows over an open fire while William and Kate chatted to scouts from several troops in the Slough area.Daniel Madigan, from the 1st Chippenham scout troop, said George, Louis and Charlotte joined in all the outdoor activities that had been laid on.\u2018I saw them toasting some marshmallows. They seemed to enjoy it,\u2019 he said.\u00a0\u2018Louis also helped move sand into a wheelbarrow.\u2019",
        "He said the Big Help Out event was to make improvements to the scout hut, including building a ramp at the rear of the scout hut to make it more accessible.As the Princess of Wales left she stopped to talk to local resident Donna Robinson who was standing by a barricade with her seven year old daughter Ciara.The Princess, casually dressed in a blue top and dark coloured trousers, held on to Louis\u2019s hand as she stopped to say hello and asked Donna how old her daughter was.Donna said:\u2019 She asked what year Ciara was and was lovely.\u2019William and Kate attended in support of the Big Help Out along with other senior royals including the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh, the Princess Royal and the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester.\u00a0Princess Anne and her husband, Vice Admiral Sir Timothy Lawrence, are at a civic service recognising local volunteers at Gloucester Cathedral, which will be followed by a special reception for invited volunteers and charity representatives from across Gloucestershire.\u00a0",

        "The 3rd Upton Scouts Hut was built in 1982 and is used by a variety of community groups in the area, including the local mosque, a senior citizens contact group for members of the Asian community and the Scout group themselves.\u00a0The building is also used by \u2018Slough All Nations,\u2019 a group with heritage spanning across St. Kitts &amp; Nevis, and which provides recreation and leisure activities to improve health and wellbeing and promote community cohesion. \u00a0Among other planned events, the Royal Parks is holding a drop-in session in Green Park in central London, close to Buckingham Palace, where volunteers can plant wild flowers in the same spot where the public laid floral tributes to the late Queen.The Duke of Gloucester, the late Queen\u2019s first cousin, and his wife Birgitte are meeting young volunteers at a Coronation party at St Mark\u2019s Coptic Orthodox Church in Kensington, west London.Meanwhile, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is helping out at a lunch club, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer will hit the phones with the NHS Volunteer Responders scheme, Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford is volunteering at a local charity shop, and Scotland\u2019s First Minister Humza Yousaf is volunteering at a local community larder.",
        "Mr Sunak said: \u2018The Big Help Out is not only a chance for everyone to come together to mark His Majesty\u2019s Coronation, it\u2019s also a reminder of how each and every one of us can help make a change for the better.\u2018It is this community spirit that binds us and makes us stronger as a country, and I hope that as part of the legacy of this historic moment of national unity, people will be inspired for years to volunteer, to help out and to make a difference to others around them.\u2019Chief Scout and adventurer Bear Grylls is the star at a huge taster session for potential recruits in Wembley, north-west London.Would-be volunteers will be able to try out Scouting activities including climbing, archery, marshmallow toasting and parachute games.",
