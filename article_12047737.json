        "In a cover story for Ebony, Halle revealed that playing Ariel,\u00a0'...is all a part of God's plan for me.'Halle has been a star since she was a teenager. She's also one half of the R&amp;B singing group Chloe x Halle with her sister Chloe Bailey.Landing the role of Ariel allowed her to spread her wings and explore her individuality.\u00a0'It was the first thing I did by myself, independently,' Halle revealed to the outlet. 'I had to move across the world. Suddenly I was in London, and I was by myself. It really forced me to grow up.'\u00a0",
        "'The whole filming experience was insane. It was the most intense, excruciatingly beautiful experience of my life. I mean, physically, mentally\u2014all of the above,' the actress admitted.\u00a0'But once I got through it, I was like, wow. [I was] really impressed with myself, because I'd never done something like that before.'\u00a0'I pushed myself as far as I've ever pushed myself in life,' she recounted to Edition magazine. 'And I feel like the message from her was to know that you've always had it in you.'\u00a0The movie filmed at London's iconic Pinewood Studios for almost a year.\u00a0",
        "'I'm really excited for my version of the film because we've definitely changed that perspective of just her wanting to leave the ocean for a boy,' Halle said.'It's way bigger than that. It's about herself, her purpose, her freedom, her life and what she wants.'Halle added, 'As women we are amazing, we are independent, we are modern, we are everything and above.'And I'm glad that Disney is updating some of those themes.'"
