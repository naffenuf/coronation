        "The actress - who made a comeback earlier this year with her\u00a0memoir Love, Pamela and her tell-all Netflix documentary Pamela: A Love Story\u00a0- had on a skimpy scarlet red bikini that made the most of her shape.\u00a0The string two piece consisted of a tiny triangle top and little briefs with not much material on the back.'The collection captures the true essence of her heart,' shared the swimsuit company on Insta Stories.\u00a0This suit is debuting just days after the\u00a055-year-old blonde bombshell, who was seen in a yellow bikini on Tuesday, posed in a red one piece suit that strongly resembled the one she wore on her TV show Baywatch which aired from 1989 until 2001.\u00a0The actress' new Frankies Bikini line goes on sale Thursday.\u00a0",
        "The icon looks just as good as ever in the skimpy swimwear as she has stayed in fantastic shape.She posed on Paradise Cove beach in Malibu, where she lived after her divorce from rock star Tommy Lee of Motley Crue.The blonde bombshell made red swimsuits popular in the 1990s thanks to her hit TV show Baywatch.\u00a0Anderson played\u00a0cute lifeguard CJ Parker on the action-drama show starring David Hasselhoff and Dave Charvet.Last week Pam shared her first swimsuit collaboration image on Instagram.\u00a0'It\u2019s about time - I have been so excited to share this with you - I\u2019m horrible at keeping a secret - Time went so slowly\u2026 But today after a long year - I can tell you All my favorite ideas and tricks of the trade - All mixed into my swimwear collaboration with @frankiesbikinis,' she wrote in her caption.",
        "'A dream come true - And who better to do this with than the sweetest girl from Paradise Cove (@francescaaiello),' she added.",
        "'She grew up before my eyes, with my boys - our story is authentic and unique. Raw, fun &amp; timeless\u2026 Available May 4th Early access link in bio \u2728,' added the star.\u00a0\u00a0In February she revealed that she has kept one of the famous red garments she wore over the course of five seasons.And the beauty - who has said she doesn't get good residuals from the show - said she likes to slip it on every so often.'I had a couple back then. Now I only have one and it fits,' shared the mother of two, who is promoting her new memoir and documentary.'I put it on every once in a while,' she told Entertainment Tonight.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The former Playboy model - who has used her celebrity status to front numerous animal rights campaigns over the years - left the series in 1997.But she returned to the role in 2017 for a cameo appearance in the movie spinoff.However, Anderson admitted she only agreed to take on the part once more\u00a0after 'a lot of bullying.'",
        "The ex of Tommy Lee also shockingly claimed bosses had expected her to do it for free.",
        "She said: 'It was becoming really, really awful. They said they wanted me to do it as a favor.\u00a0'I said, \"I do favors for animals, not for Paramount.\"\u00a0'There was just so much bullying to do it. They wanted me to do it for free, as an homage or something. I said, \"Come on, guys. I mean, really?\"'Pam reminded fans of her red Baywatch suit when she attended the\u00a0Los Angeles premiere of\u00a0her tell-all Netflix documentary Pamela: A Love Story in January.The actress showed off her incredible form and toned arms in a red hot floor-length gown that clung to her famous figure.The beauty was also joined by her sons\u00a0Brandon Thomas, 26, and Dylan Lee, 25, whom she shares with ex-husband Lee, 60.It was only fitting for the superstar to don red at the event, as she rose to fame playing lifeguard CJ Parker on Baywatch, where she wore an iconic red one-piece swimsuit.\u00a0The Canadian star wore her blonde tresses in a voluminous updo, with a few strands framing her face.She accessorized the red carpet ensemble with dangling silver earrings."
