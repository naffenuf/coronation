        "Police have been heavily criticised over the \u201cincredibly alarming\u201d arrests of Republican protesters ahead of the King\u2019s coronation.",
        "Campaign groups said Saturday\u2019s arrests, including that of the chief executive of anti-monarchy group Republic, were \u201csomething you would expect to see in Moscow, not London\u201d.",
        "The Metropolitan Police confirmed four people were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to cause a public nuisance on St Martin\u2019s Lane and that lock-on devices were seized \u2013 a move described by human rights organisation Liberty as \u201ca dangerous precedent for us as a democratic nation\u201d.Just after 7am, footage of Republic chief executive Graham Smith was posted on Twitter which showed him among the demonstrators apprehended on St Martin\u2019s Lane near Trafalgar Square.In one video an officer said: \u201cI\u2019m not going to get into a conversation about that, they are under arrest, end of.\u201dJust Stop Oil told the PA news agency approximately 13 protesters were arrested on the Mall ahead of the coronation.A spokeswoman for the campaign group said five demonstrators were also arrested at Downing Street and one at Piccadilly.Footage from the Mall showed the Just Stop Oil protesters being handcuffed and taken away by a heavy police presence.The force also said they made a number of breaching-the-peace arrests in the area of Carlton House Terrace and a further three arrests in the Wellington Arch area on suspicion of possessing articles to cause criminal damage.",
        "Animal Rising said a number of their supporters were apprehended on Saturday while at a training session \u201cmiles away from the coronation\u201d.Nathan McGovern, spokesman for the campaign group, described the arrests as \u201cnothing short of a totalitarian crackdown on free speech and all forms of dissent\u201d.Human Rights Watch labelled the arrests \u201cincredibly alarming\u201d, adding: \u201cThis is something you would expect to see in Moscow, not London.\u201dAmnesty International\u2019s chief executive Sacha Deshmukh also raised concerns after police were reportedly given instructions to apprehend people with megaphones.Outside London hundreds of people joined a march through Cardiff city centre in protest against the monarchy as the King was crowned.Demonstrators walking down Queen Street shouted \u201cDown with the Crown, not my King\u201d and \u201cGod save the poor\u201d.Nick Wall, member of campaign group Republic and chairman of the Labour For Republic organisation, addressed crowds at a Not My King rally in Cardiff where he called the arrests of protesters in London \u201cdisgraceful\u201d.\u201cI felt compelled to say a few words because one of Republic\u2019s co-ordinators, his name is Ben and he\u2019s only 21 years of age, and he\u2019s been arrested. It\u2019s appalling.\u201dAfter the King was officially crowned, the Met tweeted to say: \u201cWe swear that we will pay true allegiance to his Majesty, and to his heirs and successors according to law.\u201d",
        "One Just Stop Oil protester Ben Larsen, 25, said he was there to see the coronation and peacefully protest.Grinning at police officers, he told them: \u201cYou\u2019ve searched me and haven\u2019t found shit.\u201d",
        "A police officer told him: \u201cYou need to educate yourself on what peaceful protest is.\u201dOn Wednesday the Met said they would have an \u201cextremely low threshold\u201d for protests during the coronation celebrations, and that demonstrators could expect \u201cswift action\u201d.Under the controversial new Public Order Act, protesters who have an object with the intention of using it to \u201clock on\u201d are liable to a fine, with those who block roads facing 12 months in prison.Critics previously hit out at plans from the Met to use facial recognition software on crowds to assist their policing operations.An official letter warning of the new powers was sent to Republic, which said its campaign around the coronation would proceed as planned.Just after 7.30am on Saturday, one woman in a Republic T-shirt was carried away by officers during an interview with the PA news agency.Before being arrested, she said: \u201cWe had a delivery of placards ready for the protest and then the tactical support unit questioned us as to how we had got through the road closures.\u201cThey questioned whether what we were doing was a delivery.",
        "\u201cThey then said they found evidence of means of locking on, of items that could be used to lock on, and they arrested us.\u201dAnother protester, Symon Hill, 46, who was previously arrested for shouting \u201cwho elected him?\u201d during a proclamation ceremony for the King, said he hoped he would not be arrested again.Mr Hill had charges against him of using threatening or abusive words or disorderly behaviour likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service.He told PA: \u201c\u2018I very, very much hope I will not be arrested. I am joining peaceful, lawful protest and I am worried there will be more arrests on spurious grounds.\u201d"
