        "She posed for pictures with Brunello's daughter Carolina Cucinelli and fashion writer Pippa Vosper.\u00a0Also in attendance were Mark Strong, Martha Ward, Federica Benda and Liza Marshall for the swanky evening out.\u00a0\u00a0Emma's father-in-law Alexander Thynn died from Covid-19 in April 2020, making her husband the Marquess of Bath in April, and inheriting the estate Longleat, which is famous for being the first drive-through safari park outside of Africa.Emma has been married to Viscount Weymouth Ceawlin Thynn, 48, since June 2013, with the couple sharing sons John, six, and Henry, four.\u00a0The boys' official titles are The Honourable John Alexander Ladi Thynn and The Honourable Henry Richard Isaac Thynn.On her wedding day, Emma became the first black marchioness in British history.",

        "In the interview she said she had a 'responsibility' to maintain the estate.She added: 'I aspire to a future where [my skin colour] is not a defining characteristic.'In the past, Emma has also talked about raising her sons on the Longleat estate which contains an enormous wildlife Park.In 2014 she told Hello!\u00a0Magazine that her eldest son John was getting a varied education from living around animals.She said: 'He's learned to roar from being around the Longleat safari park lions and the animatronic dinosaurs. He can make monkey noises, too.'"
