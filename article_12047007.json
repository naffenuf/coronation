        "Former boss Javier Gracia says he and his children will be cheering Leeds on from Spain as they watch Saturday\u2019s game at Manchester City on television.",
        "Gracia has returned home to Malaga after being sacked on Wednesday, just 10 weeks and 11 Premier League games after succeeding Jesse Marsch as head coach.Director of football Victor Orta departed Elland Road by mutual consent on the same day.In a desperate late bid to retain top-flight status, Leeds have appointed Sam Allardyce with just four fixtures remaining.Gracia told The Athletic he will be watching the former England boss\u2019s first game in charge at the Etihad Stadium.\u201cI will be with my children, who will have their Leeds jerseys on and chanting \u2018Up the Whites\u2019,\u201d Gracia said.",
        "The 53-year-old said he had been informed of Leeds\u2019 decision on Monday \u2013 his birthday \u2013 via a phone call from chairman Andrea Radrizzani.\u201cIt was a call to explain the situation. It was all handled correctly by the club. I have to accept the decision from the club\u2019s owner and that\u2019s it,\u201d Gracia said.\u201cI can honestly say my time at Leeds has been an enriching experience, and the human qualities of Victor Orta have been an authentic pleasure to be around.\u201cIt was one of the places in my career where they have made me feel good and comfortable in myself.\u201cIt\u2019s been a very intense period. It hurt me a lot to lose my job, but I have to say Victor\u2019s exit is just as difficult for me, if not more.\u201d",
        "Gracia had collected 10 points from his first six games in charge before a second-half collapse in a 5-1 home defeat to Crystal Palace sent them on a vicious downward spiral.A 6-1 loss to Liverpool at Elland Road followed in their next match, while in five defeats from their last seven matches in April they conceded 23 goals, a top-flight record for a calendar month.Leeds fans will point to their side\u2019s collapse against Palace as the beginning of the end for Gracia.\u201cIt was incredible to me that we went in at half-time drawing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were balanced in our play. Then the situation that followed was hard to understand. The second half was very tough to take.\u201dThe former Watford boss cited injuries to players Tyler Adams, Luis Sinisterra and Max Wober as key factors in Leeds\u2019 loss of form and that being on the wrong end of \u201cfine margins\u201d also contributed.\u201cI had the feeling that the players felt a little like a boxer who had been hit, who is down for a few moments and wants to get up but he is not able to,\u201d he added.\u201cA player can enter subconsciously into the vicious circle from which they cannot escape.\u201cAnd we did not have that moment go our way with the fine margins. In the last minute against Leicester, Patrick (Bamford) had a chance just wide and Marc Roca came close to scoring a winner.\u201d"
