        "Social media users were blown away by Prince Louis' work ethic this morningRead More:\u00a0\u00a0Watch as Princess Charlotte forgets to curtsy to Queen Camilla at the Coronation concert (and her step-grandmother had the sweetest reaction!)Prince Louis sent royal fans wild as he happily got stuck into some shovelling while participating in the Big Help Out initiative in Slough with his family.",
        "The Prince, 40, and Princess of Wales, 41, delighted volunteers this morning when they arrived at a local Scouts headquarters with their three children Prince George, nine, Princess Charlotte, eight, and Prince Louis, five.Following on from the Coronation concert last night, the family spent hours renovating some Scouts huts for local members to use.Footage posted on Twitter by the fan account @RoyalllyBelle shows the couple's youngest son filling a wheelbarrow with sand.The young royal - who didn't attend the concert last night as it was past his bedtime\u00a0-\u00a0 was dressed in a light blue polo, navy shorts and black Adidas trainers.",
        "While Louis got stuck into the task at hand, two volunteers supervised the royal as he shovelled the sand.\u00a0The 16-second clip shows one of the older Scouts testing out the wheelbarrow to see how heavy it was - as a devoted Louis didn't pause for a second.The adorable clip ends with Louis looking over in the direction of other volunteers - where his big sister Charlotte was happily repainting some of the wood for the huts.\u00a0The clip has amassed over 1,500 'likes' since it was uploaded earlier today - and royal fans were impressed by Louis' work ethic.One replied: 'He definitely knows how to use a shovel, you can tell it's something he's done before!\u00a0",
        "'He's not mucking about with little loads either, really getting stuck in.'Another gushed: 'I could use him in the garden. Impressive!''He's done that before,' a third said. Meanwhile, a fourth added: 'Wonderful to see him enjoy himself.'",
        "What's more, Kate was seen pushing a wheelbarrow while her youngest son shoveled in sand as they helped spruce up a Slough scout hut.\u00a0He then took control, steering it expertly as his mum supported its weight.Charlotte was seen delightedly running to help prepare a new path while George, a future king himself, was spotted learning how to use a power drill.\u00a0The couple and their three children were out and about again to mark the third day of the King\u2019s Coronation, and Charles III's life of service.The Princess of Wales has been Joint President of the Scouts since 2020 and the royals joined volunteers resetting a path, digging a new soakaway, sanding and revarnishing the front door, adding planters to the front of the building and adding a mural to create a lasting legacy of the Big Help Out\u2019s work.",
