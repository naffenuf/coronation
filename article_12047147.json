        "The Scottish Government\u2019s plans for an independent Scotland are \u201clightweight\u201d, Joanna Cherry has said.",
        "An outspoken internal critic of the party, the Edinburgh SNP MP said she is unaware of what the strategy is for achieving independence, as she attacked the prospectus for Scotland after separation.Under Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish Government published three in a series of policy papers that laid out the plans for an independent Scotland.The first \u2013 described as a scene setter \u2013 made comparisons between Scotland and other independent countries in Europe, while the subsequent publications discussed the economy, currency and democracy.",
        "Speaking to the Holyrood Sources podcast, Ms Cherry said: \u201cThese policy papers that have been produced are absolutely lightweight stuff.\u201cI know there are a lot of successful, small, independent countries in Europe and I think most of us know that, but what I think voters, what people in Scotland, want to know is how are we going to get from where we are now \u2013 enmeshed in the United Kingdom \u2013 to being one of those successful countries?\u201cThat\u2019s where the difficult questions lie in relation to questions to do with currency, to do with pension payments, to do with cross-border trade, to how long will it take us to get back into the EU? Do we sit in an association agreement while we do so?",
        "\u201cI think there\u2019s answers to all these questions \u2013 in politics there\u2019s never a right answer, there has to be an answer that can be justified and an argument that can be made, but the party\u2019s not put enough energy into doing that.\u201dShe went on to say that she and her activists have not been given the required \u201cammunition\u201d to persuade voters to come over to the independence side.In the hour-long podcast, Ms Cherry hit out at former leader Ms Sturgeon a number of times, including suggesting that her administration did not further the cause of independence, and claimed the \u201cparty is intellectually dead from the neck up\u201d because it \u201chas not been allowed to have an intellectual debate for years\u201d.",
        "She also accused the former first minister of increasing the \u201ctoxicity\u201d of the debate around controversial gender reforms.Ms Cherry has been a vocal critic of allowing trans people to change their gender without a medical diagnosis \u2013 in a process known as self-ID \u2013 in recent years, which has caused run-ins with the party\u2019s hierarchy.In January, Ms Sturgeon told the News Agents podcast that opponents of the legislation \u2013 which was blocked by the UK Government with the Scottish Government looking to overturn the move in court \u2013 are using women\u2019s rights as a \u201ccloak\u201d.",
        "Ms Sturgeon said: \u201cThere are people who have opposed this Bill that cloak themselves in women\u2019s rights to make it acceptable, but just as they\u2019re transphobic you\u2019ll also find that they\u2019re deeply misogynist, often homophobic, possibly some of them racist as well.\u201dMs Cherry described the language from the former first minister as \u201cintemperate\u201d and \u201cgrossly irresponsible\u201d, claiming it \u201cfed the toxicity of the debate\u201d."
