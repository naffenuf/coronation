        "The Royals enjoyed the glamour of the Coronation, so I can\u2019t help but wonder if comments by the mother of Princess Beatrice\u2019s stepson are a little pointed.\u00a0",
        "Dara Huang, who shares son Wolfie with Beatrice\u2019s hubby Edoardo, had some choice words about privilege during her Channel 4 design show, The Big Interiors Battle.\u00a0Dara, 40, says: \u2018It makes me happy that none of the contestants are spoiled or come with a silver spoon in their mouth. They are kind and come from hard-working families like myself.\u2019\u00a0",
        "Jamie has a Lottie on his plate...\u00a0After being described by Prince Harry in his memoir Spare as \u2018the finest product of military training\u2019, I have no doubt Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton kept himself on a sharp schedule yesterday.Not only did the former SAS man, who was William and Harry\u2019s private secretary for a number of years, keep a watchful eye over his godson Prince George and Princess Charlotte, right, at one of the rehearsals, but he was on hand to usher the pages into their carriages at Buckingham Palace yesterday.He then hotfooted it over to the ITV studio to provide expert analysis alongside presenter Tom Bradby.",
        "SpongeBob's Royal coup\u00a0They showed The Emoji Movie during the Queen\u2019s funeral, so how did Channel 5 mark the Coronation? By screening cartoon favourite SpongeBob SquarePants.\u00a0The decision didn\u2019t faze Dan Walker, who hosts the channel\u2019s flagship news bulletin. \u2018That\u2019s classic Channel 5,\u2019 he joked at the Stratford Literary Festival.\u00a0",
        "However Dan, 46, was glued to the ceremony rather than SpongeBob: \u2018As a student of history, I love all the pomp.\u2019\u00a0",
        "Don't worry if you missed out on an invitation to yesterday\u2019s pomp, because I can reveal there is another way to get a glimpse of the newly crowned King soon enough \u2013 pay \u00a31.1million for a four-bedroom house at Sandringham.The Grade II-listed Station House is back on the market after a proposed sale fell through. The former station master\u2019s house is next to the now-defunct Wolferton station, which the Royal Family used until the late 1960s when visiting their Norfolk retreat. It\u2019s not a palace but does come with a turret and some very famous neighbours at Christmas\u2026Julie's a treasure\u00a0Perhaps the peers who moaned about not being invited to the Coronation should have followed the example set by Julie, Viscountess Hinchingbrooke.The American-born socialite \u2013 whose husband Luke Montagu is heir to the Earl of Sandwich \u2013 took the opportunity to dig out some heirlooms at her family\u2019s home, Mapperton House in Dorset. As well as finding her predecessors\u2019 Coronation invitations from 1937 and 1953, she discovered robes worn by the Earl of Sandwich, stashed away in bin bags for decades. That would make a good episode of Cash In The Attic!"
