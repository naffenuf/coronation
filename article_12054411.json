        "US singer Katy Perry appeared to lose her footing as she departed the King and Queen\u2019s coronation service.",
        "The pop star, who was wearing a bespoke lilac skirt suit by Vivienne Westwood, was supported by other guests from the ceremony after she nearly took a tumble on her way out of the service which took place at Westminster Abbey on Saturday.Perry, who is an ambassador for The British Asian Trust, a charity founded by the King when he was prince of Wales, will also perform at Sunday\u2019s Coronation Concert at Windsor Castle.",
        "The service was attended by more than 2,000 guests with TV presenters Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly, Dame Emma Thompson, Lord Lloyd-Webber, Dame Judi Dench and Stephen Fry among the host of famous faces.Australian musician Nick Cave, British Vogue\u2019s editor-in-chief Edward Enninful, BBC director-general Tim Davie, actress Dame Joanna Lumley, TV host Jay Blades and singer Lionel Richie, who is also on the bill for the coronation concert, were also on the guest list.Dame Joanna described the coronation as an \u201cextraordinary\u201d occasion during an interview with Sky News after the service.\u201cIt was just an extraordinary feeling, first of all it was a bit like a cocktail party because you seem to know everybody who\u2019s coming in,\u201d she said.\u201cThe music\u2019s playing, it\u2019s adorable, we\u2019re looking around.\u201cThen gradually it begins closing in, and it\u2019s a bit more formal, then suddenly it\u2019s like we\u2019ve stepped over the threshold into a mediaeval ceremony, something so extraordinary and uplifting, very religious, it was extraordinary.\u201d",
        "TV duo McPartlin and Donnelly attended the ceremony in their capacity as goodwill ambassadors for the Prince\u2019s Trust, a role they took up in 2021 after two decades working with the charity.Before the service, McPartlin told Good Morning Britain that the Prince\u2019s Trust is the \u201cbest legacy\u201d for the King to leave.\u201cHe started the Prince\u2019s Trust with his Navy pension back in 1976 and since then, the Prince\u2019s Trust has grown every year and it\u2019s now worldwide,\u201d he said.\u201cWe\u2019re just very proud to be part of it and we can see now first-hand how it does help young people in this country and around the world.\u201d",
        "The pair, who are currently on-screen presenting I\u2019m A Celebrity\u2026 South Africa, entered the abbey just before 9am in their morning suits, greeting other guests with waves and smiles.As the pair grinned and said hello to members of the congregation in the North Transept, they were welcomed with impromptu cheers.Best known for fronting shows including Saturday Night Takeaway, I\u2019m A Celebrity\u2026 Get Me Out Of Here! and Britain\u2019s Got Talent, Ant and Dec have hosted the Prince\u2019s Trust Awards 10 times and recently collaborated with the charity on a course to make the media industry more accessible.",
        "Oscar-winning actress Dame Emma, who wore a red floral jacket and her damehood medal and insignia, was accompanied by her husband, actor Greg Wise, for the ceremony.",
        "Australian singer Cave was also spotted in conversation with former Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams as they arrived at the abbey.As part of the BBC\u2019s centenary celebrations last year, Charles visited Blades for a special episode of The Repair Shop where his bracket clock and a piece made for Queen Victoria\u2019s diamond jubilee by British ceramics maker Wemyss Ware were fixed.Spice Girl Melanie Brown also spoke to ITV outside the abbey, recounting the girl group\u2019s famous encounter with Charles in 1997.She said: \u201cI think because we were all so excited on the day we all just kind of freaked out a bit, and broke protocol, and I gave him a kiss and then Geri gave him a kiss and pinched his bum\u2026 we were just overwhelmed with excitedness.\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019d do that again though\u2026 we were all just too excited.\u201dSinger-songwriter Joan Armatrading, who received a CBE for services to music, charity and equal rights in the late Queen\u2019s 2020 birthday honours, and magician Dynamo, real name Steven Frayne, were also pictured seated in the abbey.Heads of state and kings and queens from across the globe, everyday heroes and family and friends of the royal couple are also on the guest list."
