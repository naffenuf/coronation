        "Europe captain Luke Donald admits he will find it hard to give his side a significant advantage with the way he sets up this year\u2019s Ryder Cup course.",
        "As the home skipper, Donald is allowed to dictate how Marco Simone Golf Club will play for this year\u2019s contest against the United States as Europe look to bounce back from the record defeat at Whistling Straits in 2021.The former world number one and some of his potential team members also have the opportunity to contest this week\u2019s Italian Open at the venue on the outskirts of Rome, with Scotland\u2019s Robert MacIntyre defending the title he won last year.\u201cSince playing it last year, we looked at a few different fairway lines, bringing in a few fairways a little bit tighter,\u201d Donald told a pre-event press conference.\u201cThe template for European golf is to have a slightly narrower golf course, a little bit more rough, not greens that get too fast because that\u2019s obviously what the US guys are always used to.\u201cThere\u2019s not a whole lot we have changed but we have added a couple of bunkers to create opportunities for better driving. I feel like Europe has good drivers of the golf ball.\u201cI think it\u2019s a fun golf course in terms of there\u2019s potentially two or three driveable par fours. Statistically, driving is a good part of our games so to have those in there could give us a slight advantage.",
        "\u201cBut there\u2019s only so much you can do. The players are very evenly matched when it comes to statistics.\u201cYou\u2019re just trying to find little potential differences that you can capitalise on but the standard of play is very close these days. It\u2019s hard to gain a big advantage.\u201dMacIntyre defeated US Open champion Matt Fitzpatrick in a play-off to win his second DP World Tour title last September, the left-hander making a birdie on the first extra hole after he and Fitzpatrick had finished tied on 14 under par, a shot ahead of Victor Perez.Pre-tournament favourite Rory McIlroy, who was within a shot of the lead until hitting his tee shot on the 16th into the water, finished fourth on 12 under.That was just the second qualifying event for the Ryder Cup and although MacIntyre has since fallen outside the automatic places, the world number 91 is trying to play down the potential significance of a successful title defence.\u201cI worried about that for the last Ryder Cup, worried about what could be,\u201d he said. \u201cThis year, I\u2019m not worried at all about what could be. What will be will be and I\u2019ll be going out there to play golf because you enjoy it.\u201cThis week is not going to define my season. I get it\u2019s on the golf course where the Ryder Cup is going to be. Course set up is pretty similar to last year. I did it on that golf course.",
        "\u201cBut, to be honest, I am not worried just about this week and there is so much golf to be played and it\u2019s not going to define the season, good or bad.\u201cWe\u2019ll just keep marching on and working hard and hopefully we make it there come September.\u201d"
