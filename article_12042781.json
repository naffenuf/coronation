        "Scientists have caught a star in the act of swallowing a planet whole.",
        "Astronomers on Wednesday reported their observations of what appeared to be a gas giant around the size of Jupiter or bigger being eaten by its star.The sun-like star had been puffing up with old age for eons and finally grew so big that it engulfed the close-orbiting planet. If it\u2019s any consolation, this will happen (to Earth) in about five billion years  Morgan MacLeod  It is a gloomy preview of what will happen to Earth when our sun morphs into a red giant and consumes the four inner planets.\u201cIf it\u2019s any consolation, this will happen in about five billion years,\u201d said co-author Morgan MacLeod of the Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics.The galactic feast happened between 10,000 and 15,000 years ago near the Aquila constellation when the star was around 10 billion years old.There was a swift, hot outburst of light, followed by a long-lasting stream of dust shining brightly in cold infrared energy, the researchers said.",
        "While there had been previous signs of other stars nibbling at planets and their digestive aftermath, this is the first time the swallow itself has been observed, according to the study in the journal Nature.Massachusetts Institute of Technology researcher Kishalay De spotted the luminous outburst in 2020 while reviewing sky scans taken by the California Institute of Technology\u2019s Palomar Observatory.",
        "It took additional observations and data-crunching to unravel the mystery: instead of a star gobbling up its companion star, this one had devoured its planet.Given a star\u2019s lifetime of billions of years, the swallow itself was quite brief \u2014 occurring in essentially one fell swoop, said Caltech\u2019s Mansi Kasliwal, who was part of the study. All that we see around us, all the stuff that we\u2019ve built around us, this will all be gone in a flash  Kishalay De  The findings are \u201cvery plausible\u201d, said Carole Haswell, an astrophysicist at Britain\u2019s Open University, who had no role in the research.She led a team in 2010 that used the Hubble Space Telescope to identify the star Wasp-12 in the process of eating its planet.\u201cThis is a different sort of eating. This star gobbled a whole planet in one gulp,\u201d she said. \u201cIn contrast, Wasp-12 b and the other hot Jupiters we have previously studied are being delicately licked and nibbled.\u201dAstronomers do not know if more planets are circling this star at a safer distance. If so, Mr De said they may have thousands of years before becoming the star\u2019s second or third course.Now they know what to look for, the researchers will be on the lookout for more cosmic gulps. They suspect thousands of planets around other stars will suffer the same fate as this one did and, eventually, so will our solar system.",
