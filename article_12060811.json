        "The Brazilian, pictured earlier this week, spends up to 90 minutes in his personal treatment pod after a match or training to speed up recovery and prevent injury.Hyperbaric chambers - which cost as much as \u00a3100,000 - increase air pressure inside the device, forcing the user\u2019s lungs to collect up to 15 times more oxygen.Former Real Madrid captains Raul and Sergio Ramos both pioneered their use in Spain and the recovery technique is now popular with marathon runners, Padel players and many professional footballers.The Spanish giants set to defend their Champions League crown against a rampant Manchester City side, who are setting their sights on an historic treble.\u00a0",
