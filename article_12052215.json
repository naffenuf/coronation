Spurs have not called him. He has another offer, he has to make a decision.'I have a little chance to bring him to Spurs again. It's not my decision, it is the decision of the chairman. I am meeting him next week and we will see what happens. If he is going to Chelsea, or waiting for the club (Tottenham).'",
