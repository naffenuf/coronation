        "As well as volunteering at school, she runs a dance class in the local church hallREAD MORE:\u00a0The Body Coach Joe Wicks adds \u00a320million to the bottom line at his fitness empire in just one yearFor the benefit of anyone under the age of 40 reading this, Mad Lizzie was essentially the 1980s version of Joe Wicks.\u00a0",
        "There was the same zeal for getting the nation off the sofa and working out in front of the TV. The same relentless enthusiasm for squats and press-ups. The same hair.Drinking Earl Grey in the National Theatre\u2019s caf\u00e9, Lizzie Webb is delighted with the comparison. \u2018Unfortunately, after the Green Goddess, myself and Mr Motivator, it went absolutely quiet \u2013 there was no one doing [TV fitness].\u00a0So to have Joe Wicks doing that in lockdown was brilliant,\u2019 she beams, her cut-glass, commanding voice instantly recognisable from her daily workouts on ITV\u2019s breakfast show Good Morning Britain, produced by TV-am.Despite being absent from our screens for 30 years \u2013 in 1993 TV-am lost its franchise to GMTV, who brought in new presenters \u2013 Webb, 74, is still frequently recognised on the street.\u00a0",
        "The odd joker will approach her and start doing star jumps. \u2018Then I\u2019ll get flash, kick my leg up high and say, \u201cDo that, then!\u201d\u2019 she says, blue eyes twinkling. A dance teacher, she can still do the splits, although that\u2019s just \u2018an occasional party trick\u2019.\u00a0Then there are the passers-by who ask if she\u2019s the Green Goddess. \u2018I have a stock answer: \u201cNo, I\u2019m the other one\u201d.\u2019 That was Diana Moran, now 83, the BBC\u2019s Breakfast Time fitness guru, against whom Webb was hired to compete in 1983. \u2018",
        "She was this stunning, statuesque woman in a green leotard and TV-am must\u2019ve thought, \u201cWe need someone completely different\u201d,\u2019 she says.\u00a0She got the gig because the PA of channel boss Greg Dyke was a regular at one of her classes at the Dance Centre in London\u2019s Covent Garden (where Arlene Phillips and Bruno Tonioli were also teaching).\u00a0She recommended Webb, enthusing about her \u2018mad\u2019 instructor\u2019s wisecracking, high-energy style. The nickname stuck and Webb has always embraced it, although she wonders whether it\u2019d be quite as acceptable these days. Was Moran her mortal enemy?\u00a0\u2018No! We\u2019ve only met on a couple of occasions. I don\u2019t know how she viewed me, but I am grateful to her. I wouldn\u2019t have had my job without her.\u2019The nickname may not have aged well, but Webb has \u2013 the trademark curls are intact and she\u2019s immaculately groomed, with scarlet lipstick and lots of gold jewellery. In her chic Ted Baker sweatshirt, jeans and trainers, she doesn\u2019t walk across the caf\u00e9 as much as bounce.\u2018I had a pneumonia jab last week and the nurse looked at my notes and said, \u201cYou\u2019re not on any medication \u2013 do you know how unusual you are?\u201d I\u2019ve been very lucky to have had good health,\u2019 she says.\u00a0",
        "She\u2019s lived by the sea near Worthing for the past two years with her second husband, Douglas Cameron, 68, who was a technician for TV-am: \u2018The papers called him my toyboy back then, for heaven\u2019s sake!\u2019",
        "She has just written a memoir, Mad About The Boys, which is far more than a heap of fluffy 80s TV anecdotes. Webb qualified as an English, drama and dance teacher in 1970 and the titular \u2018boys\u2019 refers to the hundreds of pupils she\u2019s helped over the past half century.\u00a0She has a particular passion for working with children from disadvantaged backgrounds and has really got stuck in \u2013 she spent so much time at Huntercombe Prison in Oxfordshire teaching young offenders she was given her own set of keys.\u00a0She\u2019s set up numerous education initiatives over the decades, spending 17 years running the charity Creativity in Sport. She\u2019s worked across subject disciplines \u2013 concocting ways to teach children literacy and multiplication through movement, for example.For her first job, she asked to be sent to the worst school in London, landing in a boys\u2019 comprehensive in Clapham, where some teenagers in her class couldn\u2019t read. There she set up a lunchtime drama and dance club \u2013 one of the alumni of which is now an Emmy-winning TV producer, another the first black dancer in the English National Ballet and a third a West End theatre director.\u00a0",
        "Fifty-three years on, she\u2019s about to start a new gig as a volunteer in her local primary school.She wrote the book, she says, to inspire teachers, share innovative ways of educating and tell the stories of the kind of children who don\u2019t usually get a voice. It\u2019s deeply inspiring \u2013 not least because Webb sold so many exercise videos in the 80s that she could\u2019ve easily downed tools when TV-am folded.",
        "She is also more than happy to oblige with TV anecdotes. She chose and choreographed the music for her segments, so had the power to catapult tracks up the Top 40. Pop stars started joining her to work out. She helped break Take That in 1992, inviting them on the show three times.\u00a0\u2018Poor Gary, he\u2019s not a natural mover,\u2019 she recalls. \u2018But Jason and Howard were a gift. And dear little Mark! Robbie was just naughty. He kept treading on my toes \u2013 he\u2019s got quite big feet.\u2019Simply Red\u2019s Mick Hucknall, meanwhile, was a little ungallant. \u2018I didn\u2019t like to show guests up, so when we did press-ups, I did them on my knees the easy way. When I glanced at Mick, he was going like the clappers, doing full press-ups and telling me to keep up.\u2019",
        "She was thrilled when Biba founder Barbara Hulanicki offered to dress her for TV. \u2018What an honour! As a student, the most I could afford to buy at Biba was a pair of earrings. She\u2019d noticed I wore normal clothes rather than aerobics gear because it was important to me that everyone felt they could join in.\u2019\u00a0Hulanicki made her stretchy trousers and tops in vivid blues and pinks and viewers sent her garish jumpers they\u2019d knitted. Webb still has a few, and wheels them out for TV appearances.It wasn\u2019t all fun times. TV-am\u2019s viewing figures were dire at first, the presenters (among them Anne Diamond and Nick Owen) had to pester the accounts department to get paid and there was a lot of job insecurity.\u00a0\u2018No one was actively hostile but\u00a0I wouldn\u2019t say I came away with great friends. People were vying for position,\u2019 she says.\u00a0Owen is the only one with whom she remains in contact. It can\u2019t have helped that Webb, with her quick, light-hearted slots, became the most popular presenter, although no one told her until David Frost stopped her on the stairs one day to congratulate her.Nor were things easy at home. She was a single mother until she met Douglas, having split with Andy Webb, her first husband and a teaching colleague, in the late 70s. She talks about \u2018mother\u2019s guilt\u2019 \u2013 having never got to do the morning school run with her son Ben, now 46, thanks to her 3am alarm calls.\u00a0",
        "\u2018He was five or six when I started the job so it was a formative chunk of his childhood. I had a very good au pair but there are still times when you feel you are missing out. I used to phone him every morning from my dressing room and play him Stevie Wonder\u2019s \u2018I Just Called to Say I Love You\u2019. I still choke up when I hear that song.\u2019Her own childhood was a mixed bag, growing up in Barnet, North London, with three sisters. Her loving mother, a secretary in the House of Commons, scrimped to send Webb to theatre, violin and ballet lessons.\u00a0Her father, a Second World War veteran and computer programmer, was a tyrant by the sound of it. The four girls \u2018and even the dog\u2019 would fear the moment he walked through the door each evening. \u2018He was so controlling,\u2019 she says. \u2018We were thrashed.\u2019 Decades later she was asked by an educational psychologist why she was drawn to working with troubled children.\u00a0The answer that came out of her mouth was not the one she had carefully planned. \u2018I shocked myself. I simply said, \u201cI wish I\u2019d had someone like me to talk to when I was a child.\u201d\u2019 She doesn\u2019t want to dwell on her father\u2019s behaviour, and it\u2019s mentioned only in passing in the book.\u2018I want people to be aware of the tremendously difficult lives these children have. Mine was nothing in comparison.\u2019 She pauses, before adding quietly, \u2018Although it\u2019s all relative to you as a child at the time.\u2019Today, as well as volunteering at the school, she runs a dance class in the local church hall, following a request from villagers of a certain age who were excited to clock Mad Lizzie in their midst. She\u2019s meeting a group of nine college principals next week to talk about her experiences in education.\u00a0She worries about the impact of lockdowns on the current generation of children. She clearly doesn\u2019t need to do any of this \u2013 who would blame her for\u00a0 embracing retirement? \u2018I never twiddle my thumbs,\u2019 she says. It\u2019s not altruism, she insists.\u00a0She does it because she draws huge satisfaction from seeing others achieve things \u2013 it shows her that she\u2019s taught them well. Watch and learn, Joe Wicks!Mad About The Boys by Lizzie Webb is published by Coles, \u00a320*"
