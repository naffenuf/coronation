        "Inspired by the Grand Finale builds of previous champions, Scott and Owen constructed Titan Atlas, a breathtaking representation of the Greek mythological figure supporting a massive city above his head while traversing rocky terrain over a sea of lava.Using a technique called implied motion, they masterfully captured the moment of Atlas falling and struggling to hold the city without any visible support.\u00a0Overwhelmed by their victory, Scott expressed gratitude for the support they received throughout the competition.",
        "'The whole Lego Masters experience has been an absolutely mind-blowing and heart-filling experience...To come away with the win in this level of competition has left me speechless,' he said.Owen echoed his teammate's sentiments, noting the high stakes and their determination to create something extraordinary.He added: 'This put us into an all or nothing mindset, to try for something ridiculous both creatively and technically in an effort to stand out...In the end, all the risks paid off, and I could not be prouder of the legacy we have now left on the competition.'\u00a0"
