        "'The timing of this coronation, with all its gold and bejewelled opulence, couldn't be more distasteful and sickening.'It's unjustifiable and it's unwanted. If we're asking God to save anyone it should be the 14.4million people living in poverty, not the King.'A number of celebrities were asked to perform at the Coronation including Elton John, the Spice Girls and Harry Styles.However, they could not perform due to their busy schedules- and big names including Ed Sheeran, Robbie Williams and Adele also had to decline to be involved due to their commitments.\u00a0\u00a0Elsewhere,\u00a0Leigh-Anne \u00a0was sure to set pulses racing on Tuesday as she flaunted her incredible figure in a skimpy black bikini.",
