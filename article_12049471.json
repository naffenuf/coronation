        "The trip to Mars comes at an opportune time for Schwartz, who for the last few months has been embroiled in the drama resultant from friend and business partner Tom Sandoval's headline-making split from Ariana Madix amid his affair with Raquel Leviss.",
        "Schwartz has publicly supported Sandoval in the wake of the scandal.He appeared on Watch What Happens Live last month to defend his longtime confidante and pledge to stand by his side amid his descent into reality TV villainy for his infidelity.'Tom, I know the whole world hates you, but I'm not gonna abandon you, old buddy. I'm not gonna abandon you,' Schwartz said.Schwartz said of Sandoval: 'He knows he's a monster for what he did. If you see him, give him a hug. Maybe he doesn't deserve it, but give him a hug. He's down bad.'He said in the appearance on the Bravo chat show, 'I'm not trying to evoke any sympathy for Tom, he knows what he did was disgusting. He knows he could not have handled that affair any worse.'Schwartz said that while he understands the anger against Sandoval, 'The vigilantism is getting a little out of control.'I want to remind people to take a breath. He knows what he did was terrible, so does Raquel, but the threats, it's getting out of control. The mob mentality is getting out of control.'",
        "Stars on Mars is slated to debut on Fox June 5 at 8/7c.\u00a0"
