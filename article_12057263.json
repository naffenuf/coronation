        "Brundle had already told viewers that he had less than 10 seconds of airtime left, but producers decided to grant the interview and stayed with the presenter, rather than cutting to the start of will.i.am and LL Cool J's pre-race grid driver introductions.Within seconds, fans flocked to social media to share their thoughts on the incredible moment, with impressionist Conor Moore writing: 'If I ever want anything in my life I\u2019m asking Jackie Stewart to get it for me.'Another fan added: 'When you have taken F1 to the point where security is putting hands on Sir Jackie Stewart, you should step back and have a real think,' while another noted: 'Jackie Stewart wing manning Martin Brundle on the grid to bag the Federer interview is the Sunday evening TV that we all needed.'"
