        "A photo-finish has denied the King a racing victory on coronation day.",
        "His horse Saga, an 8-1 shot running in the Howden Suffolk Stakes at Newmarket, was narrowly beaten on Saturday afternoon by King of Conquest.Another of King Charles\u2019s horses, Candle Of Hope, finished fourth in the Listed William Hill Conqueror Fillies\u2019 Stakes at Goodwood earlier in the day.",
        "Jockey Frankie Dettori described it as a \u201cthrill\u201d to wear the colours for the King, adding: \u201cI watched the whole thing (coronation) this morning.\u201dHe said: \u201cAlmost. He ran a super race, I couldn\u2019t go when I wanted to and William (Buick) got a couple of lengths on me, but he ran a super race.\u201cOh yes (it was a thrill to wear these colours).\u201cI watched the whole thing (coronation) this morning, it was pretty special wasn\u2019t it? I know I\u2019m old, but I\u2019ve not seen one before.\u201dTrainer Thady Gosden said the King\u2019s horse was \u201cslightly unfortunate\u201d.He said: \u201cHe ran great. It wasn\u2019t his fault, he didn\u2019t get the gap in time.\u201cWilliam (Buick) got first run (on King Of Conquest) and we had to wait to get through and then he ran out of real estate at the end, but he ran a super race.\u201cHe was slightly unfortunate not to get there but it\u2019s nobody\u2019s fault, that\u2019s racing.\u201d"
