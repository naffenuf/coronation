        "When asked about taking over at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium earlier this month, Alonso appeared to commit his future at Die Werkself.'I've been in football for many years, rumours are normal but we still have a lot to achieve,' Alonso said.'That's why my head is 100 per cent here for the last few months. And my head is also 100 per cent here for next season.'After hanging up his boots in 2017 following three years with Bayern Munich, Alonso got his first start in management with Real Sociedad's reserve team, the same side he began his playing career with.Alonso took over at Leverkusen in October, with the club sitting in the relegation zone after winning just one of their first eight league fixtures.",
