        "Cherry blasted Angus Robertson for refusing to comment on club's actions\u00a0The Culture Secretary said he\u00a0would not be drawn into discussion on \u2018live\u2019 issue",
        "An MP \u2018cancelled\u2019 by a comedy club over her criticism of gender reforms has claimed that many of her party colleagues agree with her but are too scared to speak out.",
        "Nationalist MP Joanna Cherry is at the centre of a censorship row after staff at a comedy club refused to work at an event at which she was due to speak.Yesterday she accused party colleague Angus Robertson of cowardice for refusing to comment on the action taken by The Stand Comedy Club in Edinburgh.When asked yesterday about the row, on the BBC\u2019s Good Morning Scotland, Culture Secretary Mr Robertson said he would not be drawn into discussion on a \u2018live\u2019 issue.In response, Ms Cherry tweeted: \u2018There\u2019s no live legal action in relation to this matter and therefore nothing except perhaps cowardice to prevent any politician from commenting on what has occurred.\u2019",
        "Ms Cherry said she has been \u2018harassed, discriminated against and cancelled\u2019 by some in the SNP because of her stance on the gender reforms.She told BBC Radio Scotland: \u2018Many of my SNP colleagues agree with me, they are just afraid to speak out. I\u2019ve had a lot of private discussions with MPs and MSPs and many party members. But they have seen what has happened to me ever since I spoke out in favour of women\u2019s and lesbian rights.\u2019Ms Cherry said there are \u2018many others who are just going along with [gender] self-ID for a quiet life\u2019.",
        "The Stand said it \u2018will not compel our staff to work on this event.\u2019Meanwhile, scores of academics and students have urged Edinburgh University to allow a women\u2019s rights documentary to be screened \u2013 after two earlier attempts were disrupted by a pro-trans protest mob.Feminist organisation Woman\u2019s Place UK said more than 80 people had signed an open letter to the principal, Professor Sir Peter Mathieson, asking for another screening with security provided."
