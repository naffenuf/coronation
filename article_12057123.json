What we know so far about the shooterThe Texas\u00a0mall mass shooter has been named as 33-year-old Mauricio Garcia, who investigators believe\u00a0may have been a white supremacist or neo-Nazi who followed extremists ideologies. \u00a0",
        "Garcia, 33,\u00a0killed eight people\u00a0- including children - before he was shot dead at\u00a0Allen Premium Outlets on May 6.\u00a0The killer fired more than 100 times during his rampage, and he had more ammunition and weapons in his car - which he was seen coming out of before the bloodbath.Garcia, dressed in tactical gear and armed with an AR-15 and a handgun, opened fire outside a H&amp;M store on a busy Saturday afternoon in Allen, Texas.\u00a0 \u00a0He was eventually killed by a police officer - who was on the scene for an unrelated call but rushed over when\u00a0he heard the gunshots outside the H&amp;M.Garcia was a security guard, but it is unclear if he worked at\u00a0Allen Premium Outlets.",
        "It's also believed that Garcia was living at a motel at the time of the massacre. Police also searched that residence and found additional ammunition, WSJ reports.According to the Washington Post,\u00a0a patch the gunman was wearing on his chest alluded to his extremist ideologies - although no formal motive has been released.\u00a0The patch read 'RWDS' which is an acronym for 'Right Wing Death Squads.'\u00a0\u00a0This comes after new audio revealed how the heroic officer made a frantic phone call begging for his colleagues to join him on the scene, radioing: 'I need everybody I got.'\u00a0",
        "The officer bravely ran towards the active shooter - who was armed with 60 rounds and had shot more than a dozen people by this point - and killed him.About two minutes after first calling for backup, the cop said: 'I got him down.'\u00a0 Minutes later, another voice is heard on the radio saying: 'We got victims. I need an ambulance.'\u00a0The FBI and police raided dead Garcia's Dallas home just one hour after the massacre and requested a translator to speak with his family.\u00a0Neighbors say they often saw Garcia wearing a security guard-type uniform, but he was 'very quiet' and had 'very unusual behavior.'His gray Dodge Charger, which was seen at the scene, was often parked outside the home.",
        "Dashcam video showed gunman Mauricio Garcia getting out of a car and shooting at people on the sidewalk on Saturday afternoon.\u00a0More than three dozen shots could be heard as the vehicle that was recording the video drove off.Garcia was using an AR-15-style gun during the mass shooting, and was dressed in full tactical SWAT gear.\u00a0Allen Fire Chief Jonathan Boyd confirmed that seven people died at the scene, including the gunman, and then a further two victims died in hospital.\u00a0Three of the wounded were in critical condition in the evening, and four were stable, Boyd said in an update on Saturday night.\u00a0",
        "A Dallas-area medical group said it was treating victims as young as five-years-old.\u00a0Investigators confirmed they believe shooter Garcia was working alone, but they have not yet released any motive for the killings.\u00a0Fontayne Payton, 35, was at H&amp;M when he heard the sound of gunshots through his headphones. He said: 'It was so loud, it sounded like it was right outside.'I pray it wasn't kids, but it looked like kids,' he said.\u00a0The bodies were covered in white towels, slumped over bags on the ground. 'It broke me when I walked out to see that.'",
        "Payton then saw the body of the dead shooter - which was the only one not covered, he recalled.\u00a0Another witness, Kimberly Blakey, said she and her daughter, 14, were among the crowd of people rushing to flee the parking lot after the gunfire started.She said the raining bullets were 'non-stop.' Her car got shot at during the ordeal as she tried to escape.\u00a0Blakey told CNN: 'I told my daughter to get down. I could hear her start praying.'\u00a0Another witness, Sheliza Ramlall, who was in the Nike store when the violence broke out, said: 'I had the most horrifying experience earlier. I was standing in line at the Nike store when all of a sudden people started to scream and run.\u00a0",
        "'The people in the doorway saw the man with the gun outside and raised the alarm. All of us in line dropped to the floor and started to crawl looking for a hiding place while falling over each other.\u00a0'I crawled behind the counter. At that moment, I realized that we were right in plain sight and and figured that I needed to get away from the front.\u00a0",
        "'As I looked to the back of the store, I heard someone saying \u2018get to the back, get to the back\u2019 and everyone started running at that point. An employee opened the back door and let us out. We are standing by the roadside shaken, crying, and hugging each other.'Not knowing where the gunman was or what was happening on the other side was terrifying but I wanted to get out of there so I left the crowd and started to flag the cars down to give me a lift.\u00a0'An elderly woman stopped and I hopped in a panic. She started to tell me about the gunshots she heard and drove me to my car. I raced out of there with an elevated heartbeat.\u00a0'I am grateful for our brave first responders who stopped the shooter and helped the people to safety.'"
