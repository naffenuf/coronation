        "Ego was Daniel Ricciardo's undoing in his eyesFan favourite is in his second stint with Red BullNow a reserve driver, was on the grid from 2014-2018Daniel Ricciardo has admitted a selfish attitude was his undoing during his first stint with Red Bull as he endures his first year without an F1 drive since 2010.",
        "The Perth-born star , 33, shocked F1 fans when he defected to Renault in 2018 - and when reflecting on the move believes he had a sense of entitlement when on the books of Red Bull across four seasons.'Looking back at 2018 ... it was all about me, me, me,' Ricciardo told the Athletic.'At times, I reacted a little too selfishly to a bad weekend.'Now, I'm back with the [Red Bull] team, but I'd say it's a very selfless role. I've got no hidden agenda.\u00a0",
        "'I'm trying to build myself back up.'Ricciardo then moved to McLaren in 2020 - and the results were grim.He admitted to being 'humbled' by the lack of success he experienced with the famous team as a shocking run of poor form saw his F1 contract ended a year early.He was sensationally replaced by fellow Aussie Oscar Piastri, leaving the fan favourite in the wilderness.After pondering his future, he elected to be a reserve driver for Red Bull - and is now adamant his desire to succeed has returned - as well as a better attitude.'I soon\u00a0realised that OK, I'm not perfect,' Ricciardo added.'If I was to get back on the grid, of course the hunger would be filled to the top.",
        "'But it wouldn't be coming from a place where my ego or pride is getting in the way.'It's accepting that it's not always going to be perfect. It's just a reality of life.'Ricciardo also stated while he isn't fully committed to a comeback, the feeling is 'brewing' each day."
