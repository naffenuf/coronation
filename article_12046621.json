        "Lewis Hamilton said it is a \u201cdream\u201d to be in Miami ahead of the city\u2019s second Formula One race this weekend.",
        "The sport is back in the Sunshine State for the fifth round of the new campaign, which marks the first of three races to be staged in the United States this year.A debut event on the Las Vegas strip will take place in November, while Austin\u2019s grand prix at the Circuit of the Americas has been a permanent fixture on the F1 schedule since 2012.\u201cIt is a dream for us to be in Miami and in the United States,\u201d said seven-time world champion Hamilton.\u201cThey have the Miami Heat and the Miami Dolphins, too.\u201cThey are massive sporting fans here so to be in such an important city like Miami where sport is huge \u2013 and now Formula One is part of that \u2013 it is great to see.",
        "\u201cFor such a huge country, it is amazing that we finally have three races here. The difficult thing with Formula One is that you usually visit a country once a year. But the growth has been huge and it is such a big market for the sport.\u201dHamilton finished sixth at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix last weekend and he is already 45 points behind championship leader Max Verstappen.The 38-year-old\u2019s contract with Mercedes expires at the end of the season.",
        "But the noise coming out from both camps is that Hamilton will agree a new deal.Hamilton\u2019s former McLaren team-mate, and 2009 world champion Jenson Button, said this week that he cannot envisage his compatriot walking away from the sport.\u201cI just want to get back to the front,\u201d continued Hamilton, who was speaking at an IWC sponsorship event in Miami.\u201cThat is what I am working on \u2013 trying to get this team back to the front.\u201d"
