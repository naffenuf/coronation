        "Satirist Barry Humphreys to get state funeralFederal and two state governments involvedDetails on when and where to be worked out\u00a0Legendary Australian satirist Barry Humphries will be honoured with a state funeral jointly hosted by the Victorian, NSW and federal governments.",
        "Humphries died last month at St Vincent's Hospital in Sydney aged 89 following complications from hip surgery stemming from a fall earlier this year.In the UK for the coronation of King Charles III, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese revealed Humphries would receive a state funeral which the three governments would co-host.'He's someone who gave an enormous amount of pleasure to generations of Australians,' Mr Albanese told British channel Talk TV.'I know how warmly he was regarded by people in Australia and the UK.'",
        "No details were provided on when or where the funeral will be held.Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said he was not aware a three-government tribute was in train for the Melbourne-born entertainer.'I can't confirm for you where the service will be, or where the funeral will be,' Mr Andrews told reporters at state parliament on Wednesday.'As far as I know, that's not settled and we're still talking to the family.'The NSW government also appeared to confirm negotiations remained under way.'As the Prime Minister said, governments will work with the Humphries family to honour the life and legacy of the beloved Australian,' a spokeswoman told AAP in a statement.Humphries delighted and outraged audiences for more than half a century and was a founding patron of the Melbourne International Comedy Festival, leading to it name its annual prize for most outstanding act after him in 2000.",
        "Mr Albanese declined to weigh in on whether the festival 'cancelled' Humphries by stripping his name from its annual award over controversial remarks he made about transgender people.The prime minister instead remembered Humphries as a quintessential Australian character, who brought a sense of Australian larrikinism to his satirical characters of Dame Edna Everage, Sir Les Patterson and Sandy Stone.'Barry Humphries could only have come from Australia. What Barry Humphries would say is (Australians like) 'taking the piss out of ourselves',' Mr Albanese said.'He did it so well and for such a long period of time, so it was a big loss for the Australian arts community.'The prime minister's office has been contacted for further comment."
