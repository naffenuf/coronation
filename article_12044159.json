        "Robert J. O'Neill,\u00a0a decorated combat veteran who served for eight years as a member of SEAL Team Six, said on Twitter he 'can't believe [he] fought for this bulls**t.''Alright. The U.S. Navy is now using an enlisted sailor Drag Queen as a recruiter,' he wrote. 'I'm done. China is going to destroy us.'O'Neill was referencing Yeoman 2nd Class Joshua Kelley, whose stage name is Harpy Daniels, who announced on TikTok\u00a0in November that she would be the Navy's first 'digital ambassador.'\u00a0Kelley was tasked with highlighting her journey from performing on board beginning in 2018 and growing to become an 'advocate' for those who 'were oppressed for years in the service.'A Navy spokesman told DailyMail.com the digital ambassador program was a pilot that ended in March 2023.",
        "The program Kelley was part of ran from October 2022 to March 2023 and was designed to 'explore the digital environment to reach a wide range of potential candidates' for military recruitment.\u00a0After O'Neill sent out his tweet Wednesday afternoon, others chimed in to share in O'Neill's outrage over the ambassadorship.\u00a0His tweet quickly gained 1.1 million views and thousands of likes and retweets.\u00a0'As a Navy veteran, I am ashamed on behalf of the US Navy. I hope that goes over as well as Bud Light did,' one person responded.",
        "'This is beyond disturbing. I\u2019m a former military officer and I just can\u2019t believe what our brass is doing,' another added.\u00a0'An insult to every veteran and their families. My dad just rolled over in his grave at Arlington. I'm so glad he didn't have to see this happen,' a woman wrote.\u00a0Others strongly disagreed with O'Neill's sentiments, however, calling him out for his statements.'Honor, Courage &amp; Commitment ,, I stand with the US Navy &amp; their choice,' one woman who identified herself as a veteran commented under O'Neill's post.\u00a0'Local man angry that he fought for freedom of expression,' another wrote.\u00a0'Can\u2019t believe you fought to uphold the freedoms of citizens to be free to live however they choose? You did read the Constitution you swore an oath too right? Or did you skip the terms and conditions just to join?' one man said.\u00a0",
        "While the campaign was active, Kelley was one of five digital ambassadors.\u00a0Many have since compared her to Dylan Mulvaney, the trans activist whose association with Bud Light sparked a PR crisis for the brand.\u00a0Kelley has a large following on TikTok where she has been sharing videos of her drag performances on-board Navy ships for years.\u00a0The outrage over the now discarded program comes as the military is\u00a0predicted to miss its recruiting targets for the 2023 fiscal year.\u00a0",
        "The Military Times reported last month\u00a0\u00a0the U.S. Navy, Air Force, and Army are all on track to fall short by 'thousands' of recruits.The Navy specifically is looking at a shortcoming of some 6,000 members.\u00a0The Army is set to be off by around 10,000 while the Air Force is projected around 3,400."
