        "Erik ten Hag threw his backing behind David De Gea despite the slip which loosened Manchester United\u2019s grip on the final Champions League place.",
        "Goalkeeper De Gea is in talks over a new contract at Old Trafford, but he did not exactly enhance his negotiating position after letting let Said Benrahma\u2019s hopeful shot from 20 yards bounce over his glove to condemn United to a 1-0 defeat at West Ham.They now lie just one point ahead of a rapidly advancing Liverpool, albeit with a game in hand, after an eighth defeat on the road this season and a second in four days following the last-gasp loss at Brighton.\u201cFrustrating? Yes, I\u2019ve seen it in the same way. I think we started well, dictated the game, created chances, didn\u2019t take them and then one mistake,\u201d said United boss Ten Hag.",
        "\u201cTwice individual mistakes and you lose games. But it is what it is. Now we have a full week, we have to reset, reload and keep going.\u201c(De Gea) has the most clean sheets in the Premier League, we would not be in this position without him. No concerns. It happens but as a team you have to deal with it, show character and resilience.",
        "\u201cWe want him to stay and to extend his contract.\u201dLukasz Fabianski made late saves from Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial but Ten Hag\u2019s side offered little in their 57th match of a gruelling season which, as well as Liverpool, might just be catching up with them.",
        " (De Gea) has the most clean sheets in the Premier League, we would not be in this position without him. No concerns  Erik ten Hag  But Ten Hag insisted: \u201cNothing changed. We could have made it easier with a win. We need three wins from four games, everything is in our hands.\u201cTiredness is in your head. If you have the willingness you can take it. It\u2019s up to the players and staff to be together, to get the willingness in that we can take it.United\u2019s defeat could prove as costly for the visitors as it was priceless for West Ham, who climbed seven points above the relegation zone and are surely now safe.It was a first victory over his former club for Hammers manager David Moyes since he was in charge at Everton, in August 2012, and a huge boost ahead of this weeks Europa Conference League semi-final against AZ Alkmaar.\u201cIt\u2019s a huge step, getting three points is huge against whoever but against Manchester United was massive for us,\u201d said Moyes.\u201cIt\u2019s a great result going into a European semi-final and we\u2019ll take a lot of confidence from it. We have another big challenge and we are looking forward to it.\u201dHammers skipper Declan Rice put in another terrific display, showing just why the likes of United, Arsenal and Chelsea are constantly being linked with him this summer.",
        "\u201cHe was outstanding tonight. He\u2019s great across the ground, very quick. I\u2019m pleased, but not surprised,\u201d added Moyes.\u201cThat\u2019s why he\u2019s probably the best England midfield player around \u2013 and he\u2019s going to be extremely expensive if anyone comes in for him.\u201d"
