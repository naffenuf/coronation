        "David Martindale is adamant there is no chance of Livingston winding down in the closing weeks of the season even though they have little to play for.",
        "The Lions spent much of the season in the top half of the cinch Premiership and in contention for a European place but a run of six defeats in nine games before the split led them to slip into the bottom six.Livingston have little chance of being relegated \u2013 they are 11 points clear of second-bottom Kilmarnock \u2013 but Martindale feels duty-bound to ensure his team do not take their foot off the gas as each of the five sides they will be coming up against are still threatened by the drop.\u201cIn the last batch of fixtures we fell a bit short for the top six and we\u2019ve only got ourselves to blame,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when you look at the bottom six it would be hard to say there\u2019s nothing to play for when you look at the teams that are around us.\u201cOur next three games are Ross County, Kilmarnock and Dundee United who are all fighting for their lives to stay in the Premiership.\u201cI\u2019ve got to make sure for the integrity of the league, not just Livingston Football Club, that I\u2019m not tinkering with my squad thinking about next season because there\u2019s a lot at stake for teams within the bottom six.",
        "\u201cI\u2019ll be trying to play my strongest team possible because I genuinely do think I\u2019ve got to do that for sporting integrity.",
        "\u201cHave I got one eye on next year? Potentially. But is that going to have an impact on my decision-making just now? Probably not because of the reasons I\u2019ve touched on, for the better of Scottish football and the teams in the bottom six.\u201dLivingston missed out on the top six on the last pre-split weekend last season but picked themselves up from that blow and finished a comfortable seventh in the league with three wins and two draws from their five bottom-six fixtures.Martindale is confident his team will not be plagued by any lingering negativity this time round either.\u201cWe did it last year and we\u2019ll do it again,\u201d he said when asked if it would be hard for the players to rouse themselves for the run-in. \u201cThe way I like to coach is \u2018one game at a time\u2019 so there\u2019s not going to be a hangover.\u201cIf we go up to Ross County (this Saturday) and don\u2019t pick up points it will not be because of their mindset about not getting into the top six.\u201cThat doesn\u2019t play a part in my psyche anyway, and I\u2019ll be making sure it doesn\u2019t play a part in the players.\u201d"
