        "Ms Watson told BBC News: 'We've got a homemade cocktail with us called Purple Rain, which we made ourselves out of gin and blue curacao and lemonade and grenadine, I think.'We offered him some, we gave him a cup and he poured himself a little drink and had some. He liked it, said it was really nice and he offered some to Kate, she had some and thought it was very nice as well.'The prince was fascinated by cans of Return Of The King coronation ale which the group had brought, and holding one asked: 'That's from Windsor?'During the walkabout the public swarmed around the couple and William and Kate crouched down to talk to children with their parents, and they both posed separately for group photographs and selfies.One woman in the crowd complimented Kate on the headpiece, by Jess Collett x Alexander McQueen, she wore for the coronation, telling her: 'I loved your headpiece.'The item featured silver bullion, crystal and silver thread work three-dimensional leaf embroidery, and in response Kate touched the woman on the shoulder as if to say 'thank you'.",

        "The heir to the throne also revealed that his father Charles' neck hurt last night after wearing St Edward's Crown, which weighs a\u00a0hefty 5lbs and had to be carefully adjusted by the Archbishop of Canterbury to ensure it didn't topple off his head.Speaking to one group of fans, the prince said:\u00a0'I think his neck hurt last night, having the crown\u2026it does weigh a hell of a lot.'When the couple first walked over to chat to family groups picnicking ahead of the concert, William was offered a drink in a union-flag decorated paper cup by a group of women who all wore yellow-coloured cloth crowns.\u00a0He took a sip and later handed it to his wife, who drank from the cup and appeared to like it.",
        "William was handed a can of 'Return of the King', a specially brewed organic 'Coronation ale'. He looked absolutely thrilled, and Kate smiled as her husband told the well-wisher he'd save it for later.\u00a0At one point, Kate, wearing a pale blue blazer and white top, picked up a small union flag on a stick which had fallen on the floor and handed it to the well-wisher who dropped it. She also comforted a little girl who was overwhelmed to meet her.Scores of people crowded around the Prince and Princess of Wales in Windsor, with William crouching down to chat to a boy and girl wearing golden crowns. The prince and princess looked relaxed, with William telling one group of well-wishers: 'Enjoy the concert tonight.'",
        "One woman in the crowd complimented Kate on the headpiece, by Jess Collett x Alexander McQueen, which she wore at the coronation, telling her 'I loved your head piece'.The item featured silver bullion, crystal and silver thread work three-dimensional leaf embroidery, and in response Kate touched the woman on the shoulder as if to say 'thank you'.The prince and princess continued to chat to the well-wishers and finally ended their walkabout, which lasted 40 minutes, with a wave goodbye.The couple's appearance came shortly after Buckingham Palace issued the first public statement on behalf of Charles and Camilla since they were crowned.A Palace spokesman said the King and Queen were 'deeply touched' by the nation's celebration of their historic coronation.'Their Majesties were deeply touched by the events of yesterday and profoundly grateful both to all those who helped to make it such a glorious occasion - and to the very many who turned out to show their support in such numbers in London and further afield,' he said.Heir to the throne William is to take to the stage to deliver a speech during the musical extravaganza in the grounds of Windsor Castle, with Kensington Palace sharing behind-the-scenes footage of the prince during rehearsals.The King, Queen and royal family will join around 20,000 members of the public at the musical extravaganza to see performances by Take That, Katy Perry and Lionel Richie.Kate Middleton greeted fans dressed in a pale blue blazer, while Prince William opted for a darker shade as he shook hands with those gathered outside the castle.\u00a0",
