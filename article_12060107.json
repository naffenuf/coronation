        "A lip reader said the King\u2019s youngest son moaned \u2018I\u2019m fed up with the way they treat me\u2019 as he took his position in the third row at Westminster Abbey.The Duke of Sussex was speaking to his cousin Princess Eugenie\u2019s husband Jack Brooksbank, during his brief trip to Britain for the Coronation.Harry, 38, was sitting between Mr Brooksbank and Princess Alexandra, a first cousin of the late Queen, and behind Princess Anne and her husband Sir Timothy Laurence.It was not clear who was the target of his \u2018fed up\u2019 complaint, although there has been speculation he could have been speaking about the Royal Family, following ongoing tensions over his decision to quit as a working royal and publish a highly critical memoir.",
        "He may also have been speaking about the media as he is currently embroiled in High Court legal action against several newspaper publishers, including the Daily Mail and The Mail on Sunday.Lip reader Jeremy Freeman told The Sun newspaper that Harry remarked: \u2018I\u2019m fed up with the way they treat me\u2019 and later commented: \u2018It\u2019s not an ideal situation.\u2019Mr Brooksbank apparently replied: \u2018If I can make you feel any better, and even I can do it. It\u2019s not the quiet life, is it.\u2019Harry appeared to shake his head before responding: \u2018They don\u2019t care.\u2019",
        "Princess Eugenie\u2019s husband said: \u2018I haven\u2019t time for that, not if it\u2019s over...\u2019Harry added: \u2018It\u2019s an eventuality.\u2019",
        "The duke, who remains fifth in line to the throne, could be seen joining the homage to his father during the service, saying: \u2018God save King Charles. Long live King Charles. May the King live for ever.\u2019Lip readers also spotted Harry telling Mr Brooksbank he was due on a flight later that afternoon, and he left within minutes of the service ending.Harry has remained closest to Eugenie and her husband following the acrimony over his decision with wife Meghan to quit as working royals.His relationships with his older brother the Prince of Wales and his father the King have come under unprecedented strain following the publication of his highly critical memoir, Spare.Harry\u2019s appearance at Westminster Abbey followed months of speculation over whether he and Meghan would attend, amid ongoing tensions with senior royals.The Duchess of Sussex chose to remain at their \u00a311million home in Montecito, California, with their two young children Archie and Lilibet.",
        "Their son Archie celebrated his fourth birthday on Saturday and Harry left Britain immediately after the Coronation service to fly back to the US.He had spent less than 29 hours in Britain after flying in on Friday morning.",
        "But the Mail told today how Charles raised a glass to Prince Archie\u2019s birthday at a private family gathering following the Coronation.The King toasted William\u2019s three children George, Charlotte and Louis, who all attended the service in the Abbey.He then made a point of toasting \u2018those that weren\u2019t there\u2019 and wishing his other grandson a very happy birthday \u2018wherever he was\u2019, a source told the Mail."
