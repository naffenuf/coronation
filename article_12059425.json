        "Researchers timed how long it took cats to approach after they offered signalsThey came quickest when the experimenter provided both visual and vocal cuesIt is hoped the findings will improve the quality of human-cat relationshipsCats are famous for their independent and aloof nature, but a new study has revealed the way to the heart of even the most standoffish feline.",
        "Scientists from the Paris Nanterre University sat in a 'cat cafe', where kitties roam freely and can approach customers, to test out different ways of winning them over.They found that cats responded most quickly to human strangers when they offered vocal and visual cues together, like calling their name while reaching out their hand.But when the human ignored the animals completely, they were more likely to wag their tail - a sign of frustration or agitation.The researchers hope their findings will improve the quality of human-cat relationships and cat welfare.",
        "'People should be encouraged to use appropriate visual communicative cues when engaging interactions with cats, especially with unknown individuals,' the authors wrote.",
        "The results show that\u00a0cats approach strangers much more quickly when they provided a visual or both a visual and vocal signal simultaneously.'A short latency of approach is thought to reflect higher attraction,' the authors wrote.Previous research has found that trained dogs do not respond as well to vocal signals from unfamiliar people as they do from familiar.\u00a0The authors suggest that this could be the same for cats.",
        "Cats are known to have developed the ability to interpret and respond to human signals through their domestication.Recent studies have found that they can recognise their owner's voice\u00a0when they are talking to them directly, and also view a slow blink as a smile.",
        "However, according to the authors of the new work, research into human-to-cat interactions is currently limited.\u00a0For their study, published in Animals, the team wanted to find out how sensitive cats are to human cues, which ones they are most receptive to and how they respond.They recruited 12 cats for the study, who had lived in one of two cat cafes in\u00a0Bordeaux and Toulouse in France for at least three years.One at a time, the cats were led into a quiet room with their owner, where a researcher was waiting who it had never met before.After 10 seconds, the researcher would do one of four things; offer a visual signal, a vocal signal, both a visual and vocal signal simultaneously (bimodal) or no signal at all.Examples of visual signals were extending their hand and slow blinking, while examples of vocal signals were calling the cat's name or making a 'pff pff' sound, which is\u00a0widely used by French people to call cats.The time it took for the cat to come within four inches (10 cm) of the researcher was recorded, as well as how they responded, like by vocalising, blinking or wagging their tail.\u00a0",
        "After analysing the results, it was found that cats approached the researcher much more quickly when they provided a visual or bimodal signal.",
        "'A short latency of approach is thought to reflect higher attraction,' the authors wrote.They say that the vocal communication by itself may not have been attractive because cats are not accustomed to being called without the human making eye contact.Additionally, of all the different responses the cats gave, only tail wagging was found to be\u00a0significantly affected by the type of human communication signal given.\u00a0They wagged their tails much more when they were not given a signal than when they were given a\u00a0visual or bimodal signal.\u00a0'Lateral tail movements tend to occur when cats are facing a frustrating situation,' the authors wrote.'Therefore our data suggest that being in a room with an unfamiliar human ignoring them might be uncomfortable for cats, if not frustrating.'",
        "There was also more wagging in response to the vocal cue than the bimodal, suggesting this was more frustrating for them.Lead author Dr\u00a0Charlotte de Mouzon told Gizmodo that the cat may be especially stressed because they had previously played with humans in that very room, but now they were ignoring them.They conclude that cats\u00a0display a preference for visual and bimodal cues expressed by strangers.They say this is evidence that cats have developed specific ways of communicating with humans through their domestication, which have proved effective and beneficial to the species.",
        "Previous research has found that trained dogs do not respond as well to vocal signals from unfamiliar people as they do from familiar.\u00a0The authors suggest that this could be the same for cats, and would explain why they were not so attracted by the vocal cues alone from the unfamiliar researcher.\u00a0'Results arising from the present study may serve as a basis for practical recommendations to navigate the codes of human\u2013cat interactions,' they wrote.",
        "Cat caf\u00e9s have exploded in popularity over the past decade \u2014 springing up in locations across the world.But a new study suggests they might not necessarily be the best place for our feline friends.That's because researchers have found that kittens in trendy cat cafes have higher rates of sickness than those in foster care.Worse still, these illnesses end up creating a domino effect whereby the cats have less chance of being adopted.They also spread disease to other felines in the caf\u00e9s, altering their behaviour and again reducing adoption rates as a whole.Read more here\u00a0"
