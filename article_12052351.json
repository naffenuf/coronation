        "And if there is one driver who stands at the edge of this new frontier, he was sitting in the Mercedes motorhome every inch its poster boy with a big white watch and three rings per hand, beaming.Lewis Hamilton, 38, loves being in America, which may have led him to the optimistic conclusion spoken of on Thursday night that he would consider racing into his fifties. \u2018Never say never,\u2019 he said.Actually, we cannot yet be sure he will continue into his forties. But he did insist: \u2018I\u2019m going nowhere soon.\u2019 Formula One bosses will have squealed in delight at that promise from their main draw.But, first, to the Miami vibe, the drama of which includes Lewis being accompanied by police outriders from the track in the less salubrious Miami Gardens area and along the Biscayne Boulevard to sanctuary in the dramatically sky-lined glamour of the place\u2019s fame.",
        "It was against that backdrop that the Miami Grand Prix was meant to have played out. That was Liberty Media\u2019s dream after they bought the sport in 2017, to stage \u2018Super Bowl\u2019 events at destination cities.But there was such a hue and cry from locals about the disruption entailed that a sticking plaster was found at Miami Dolphins\u2019 Hard Rock Stadium 16 miles north of downtown. What a fine sticking plaster it looks this weekend for the second running of the race. Last year, in contrast, the place was buzzing with excitement, but barely ready.",
        "Behind the shiny celebs and the busiest and blingiest grid walk ever, the Paddock Club guests upstairs were suffering severe first-world privations for their \u00a310,000 bill. Food ran out. Staff failed to show up. Emergency meetings were held.This glitch has been rectified, a whole new Paddock Club built, bars and restaurants added outside the garages. The paddock has moved \u2014 now ingeniously assembled on the stadium\u2019s AstroTurf playing surface itself.A galaxy of VIPs, including Mike Tyson, is expected on Sunday among a 90,000 crowd. However, Brad Pitt will be here in spirit only, despite being closely associated with Liberty\u2019s push to capture America.The Hollywood A-lister, 59, is starring in F1\u2019s upcoming movie, intended to build on the evangelising work of Drive to Survive and the addition of a race on the Las Vegas Strip in November to sit alongside Miami and Austin on the US footprint.Pitt will even drive a modified F2 car in front of 140,000 fans at the British Grand Prix as filming starts on the weekend of July 9.Filming will then continue around the world for the rest of the season, with Pitt again in the cockpit, though not during sessions.Hamilton, co-producer of the so-far untitled film, is working on the script and says the finished article must be \u2018authentic\u2019.",
        "\u2018I like the direction the sport is all going in,\u2019 he said. \u2018I hope we get to Africa soon. It\u2019d be amazing for the whole circus to experience that culture.",
        "\u2018I love all the older circuits most. Maybe in 20 or 30 years\u2019 time some kid will see Miami as a historic track. But classics like Silverstone, Budapest, Zandvoort and Monza will always be special.\u2019As for the wear and tear of a 23-race season, Hamilton was as unconcerned as you might be with a private jet sitting on the runway, saying: \u2018It is not taking me longer to recover.\u2018When I was 22, I was just going home having a pizza. I didn\u2019t have any specialists around me to help me navigate that. I didn\u2019t have details of what to eat, how to replenish and all those things.\u2019Which is why when asked if he could continue racing until his 50th birthday and beyond, Hamilton said with a smile: \u2018Well, Brad is going in the movies in his fifties.\u2019"
