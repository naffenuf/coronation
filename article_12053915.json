        "Josh Little is making his way from Jaipur to Chelmsford after departing the Indian Premier League to boost Ireland\u2019s hopes of World Cup qualification.",
        "The 23-year-old left-armer has become a hot property in white-ball cricket, performing strongly in his maiden IPL campaign with Gujarat Titans after picking up a contract worth around \u00a3400,000.He missed Ireland\u2019s last three Test matches to take part in the tournament but is putting his country first as they take on Bangladesh in three ODIs to be hosted by Essex next week.",
        "Ireland need to claim a whitewash to automatically book their place at the World Cup in India later this year, and will need to head for the qualifier in Zimbabwe if they fail to do so.Little\u2019s presence in the attack raises their chances, but they will still need to be at the top of their game and hope the weather in Essex allows the series to go ahead in full.Former England international Vikram Solanki, director of cricket at Gujarat, said: \u201cWe wish Josh the best as he heads back to represent Ireland in the ODIs. He has had a good run in his first Indian Premier League and we look forward to welcoming him back once he finishes the ODI series.\u201dIreland are back in Test action when they face England at Lord\u2019s next month."
