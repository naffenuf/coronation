        "'He was a top player and that's why I had so much respect for him but I don't remember if I've told this story before but we lost the game and we was in a huddle like this and we're talking about it.'Because I'm always lively and all that sort of stuff, I might have just had a smile on my face and he just says \"what the f*** you laughing at?\"'I was like \"no it can't happen\" that and then his assistant, Mark Bowen, he was giving it all this and he sent me in. And then I went into the manager's office after and I said \"gaffa what was that all about?\" And he didn't say nothing\u00a0'At least If you're going to try and embarrass me in front of people, if it's me and you, then tell me how you really feel and he didn't like that confrontation.'",
