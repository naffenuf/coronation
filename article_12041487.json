        "Nick Cave has defended his decision to attend the King\u2019s coronation, explaining he has an \u201cinexplicable emotional attachment\u201d to the British royal family.",
        "The Bad Seeds musician, 65, denied being a \u201cmonarchist or a royalist\u201d but said he would not be \u201cso damn grouchy\u201d as to refuse an invitation to \u201cwhat will more than likely be the most important historical event in the UK of our age\u201d.Cave was chosen as part of a group of 14 \u201coutstanding Australians\u201d, including comedian and Channel 4\u2019s The Last Leg host Adam Hills, to represent the country at the coronation, which will be led by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.",
        "Writing in his newsletter the Red Hand Files in reply to letters from three Australians and one British fan, singer-songwriter Cave defended his decision to attend the royal celebrations.He said: \u201cI am not a monarchist, nor am I a royalist, nor am I an ardent republican for that matter; what I am also not is so spectacularly incurious about the world and the way it works, so ideologically captured, so damn grouchy, as to refuse an invitation to what will more than likely be the most important historical event in the UK of our age.\u201cNot just the most important, but the strangest, the weirdest.\u201dCave also wrote about meeting the late Queen during an event at Buckingham Palace, describing her as \u201calmost extra terrestrial\u201d and \u201cthe most charismatic woman I have ever met\u201d.",
        "He said: \u201cWhen I watched the Queen\u2019s funeral on the television last year I found, to my bafflement, that I was weeping myself as the coffin was stripped of the crown, orb and sceptre and lowered through the floor of St George\u2019s Chapel.\u201cI guess what I am trying to say is that, beyond the interminable but necessary debates about the abolition of the monarchy, I hold an inexplicable emotional attachment to the royals \u2013 the strangeness of them, the deeply eccentric nature of the whole affair that so perfectly reflects the unique weirdness of Britain itself.\u201cI\u2019m just drawn to that kind of thing \u2013 the bizarre, the uncanny, the stupefyingly spectacular, the awe-inspiring.\u201dReplying to the message from the British fan which asked \u201cwhat would the young Nick Cave have thought\u201d of his attendance at the coronation, he replied: \u201c\u2026the young Nick Cave was, in all due respect to the young Nick Cave, young, and like many young people, mostly demented, so I\u2019m a little cautious around using him as a benchmark for what I should or should not do\u201d.He added: \u201cHe was cute though, I\u2019ll give him that. Deranged, but cute.\u201dCave, who was named an Officer of the Order of Australia in 2017 for his \u201cdistinguished service to the performing arts and a \u201cmajor contributor to Australian music, culture and heritage\u201d, signed off the letter saying he was \u201clooking forward\u201d to the coronation, adding that he thinks he will wear a suit."
