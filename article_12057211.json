        "Ahead of his performance, he told the PA news agency: 'I think he's going to bring a new flavour. I'm going say this to you honestly, a lot of people don't know this about him, but he has an amazing sense of humour that we haven't seen yet, so I think we may in the future see a little bit of a glimpse of that - and of course, inclusiveness.'Richie revealed that he immediately jumped at the chance to perform at the celebratory concert, saying: 'It's an honour because it's every 80 years, except for the Queen who just took it all the way to the end. But I mean, this is amazing.'The singer added that he had a chance to speak to Charles ahead of the event and revealed he was 'so happy' and 'really looking forward' to the concert.'He's throwing a party, think about that.

        "The singer said she found the coronation service on Saturday to be 'remarkable', as her home country of America does not have the same type of pageantry.The concert was considered by many to be a crowning touch on the magnificent weekend, after joyous big lunch celebrations today and a surprise walkabout by the Prince and Princess of Wales.Reflecting on his thoughts surrounding the royal family ahead of the concert, host Mr Bonneville said: 'I think each generation will need to make its own definition of what monarchy means.'And I think that is the challenge for the future. In our ever-changing world, where does the monarchy stand? What does it mean?'I mean, for my generation, and for my parents' generation, it was the glue that bound our nations together, and that glue will need to shift and evolve in order to keep the strength that it's had in the past.'Bonneville said he thought the coronation service was 'extraordinary' and admitted that he found the moment the King swapped his 'robes of status and honour' for a simple white shirt for the private anointing as 'particularly touching'.He added: 'It's a crazy old service, it's strange to think how it's accreted over the years, over the centuries to what it is today and it obviously will have a new meaning, a different meaning for our generation, the generation that witnessed it with the late majesty.'I found it moving and an extraordinary change-marker in the sand for our culture and for our generation.'",

Relapse ravers, we call them - so maybe there's a few relapsed ravers in the royal household, we don't know.'Meanwhile, fashion designer Stella McCartney delivered a spoken word performance with a conservation theme which will reflect her and the King's 'shared passion for environmental sustainability'.Her performance was part of a broader nature-themed section of the concert which included a rendition of a 1980s hit by classical-soul composer Alexis Ffrench and London-based singer-songwriter Zak Abel alongside a house orchestra, band and choir."
