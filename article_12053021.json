        "On Christmas Day, 1066, William the Conqueror was crowned at Westminster Abbey. His claim to the throne was tenuous, but he seized it by force of arms.",
        "Nearly a millennium later, Charles III inherits the crown in a more peaceful manner \u2013 but at the same place, in a ceremony rooted in the same ritual and carrying the same weight.Despite wars of succession, multiple regicides and the bloody shift from absolute to constitutional monarchy, Charles can still trace his line directly back.In an ever-changing world, such continuity is remarkable. That the institution has survived intact is an extraordinary testament to its durability and willingness to adapt.For all that republicans seek to pull the monarchy down, history has not served up a more stable alternative anywhere on the planet.",
        "Who would really prefer President Starmer to King Charles III? Or, God forbid, President Rayner.Today's Coronation will be the kind of glorious pageant for which this country is renowned and envied around the world.\u00a0Outside will be a cornucopia of colour with cheering crowds, gleaming breastplates and elegant carriages carrying the main players.Inside, the carefully choreographed proceedings \u2013 accompanied by uplifting music and sermonising \u2013 will formally confirm the legitimacy of the sovereign.There's no doubt Charles has a hard act to follow. His mother was in every way the perfect monarch: Wise, diplomatic, discreet and dedicated to a life of service.Some feared the stature of the Royal Family would be diminished after the Queen died. But for all the doubters, her son clearly shares many of her best qualities.",
        "With the estimable new Queen, Camilla, by his side he has developed from a sometimes aloof younger man into a more rounded and engaging character \u2013 although his weakness for wokery raises eyebrows.Nevertheless, Charles's respect for and understanding of all religions will be an asset in what is a remarkably harmonious multi-ethnic, multi-faith society. So will his enduring commitment to the young.The Daily Mail believes he can be a huge success, blending this country's customs and traditions with creating a monarchy for modern times. God save the King.Sunak's wake-up callLet's not beat about the bush. The local elections were truly terrible for the Tories.After an annus horribilis \u2013 a bleak economic picture, the defenestration of two prime ministers \u2013 the party feared voters would give it a bloody nose. What it got was more like a punishment beating \u2013 losing hundreds of councillors.Of course, it's true that Rishi Sunak has steadied the ship since Liz Truss's ignominious interlude.\u00a0Yet when Tory MPs succumbed to collective hysteria and cut down Boris Johnson, the party was ten points behind Labour. The gap is currently 15.It's not hard to work out what's gone wrong. Instead of pursuing growth and controlling our borders, the Conservatives have seemingly outsourced tax policy to Jeremy Corbyn, energy to Greta Thunberg and immigration to Refugee Action.",
        "However, the council results are hardly a cause for Sir Keir Starmer to crack open the prosecco. While Labour is on track to become the largest party at a general election, it would fall short of an outright majority.There is no clamour for this vacuous dud with an unappealing streak of self-righteousness and dreadful political instincts.\u00a0From seeking to thwart Brexit to opposing the deportation of foreign killers and rapists, he has made the wrong calls again and again.\u00a0The last thing the country needs is him leading a coalition of chaos with the Lib Dems and SNP.This must be a wake-up call for Mr Sunak. If he wants to win back Tory voters, the answer is simple. Offer some Tory policies."
