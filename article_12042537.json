The lights from the ambulances were flashing in our windows all evening.'It must have been about 11pm before a flat-bed truck come to take the car away.'A spokesman for West Yorkshire Police said: 'At 5.55pm yesterday, police were called to Acre Crescent, Middleton, where a man had been found dead.'There were no suspicious circumstances and the Coroner's Officer has been informed.'Yorkshire Ambulance Service was approached for comment.",
