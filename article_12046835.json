        "The 34-year-old defender picked up a nasty injury against Leicester on MondayColeman had hoped to be back soon to take part in Everton's relegation scrapBut Sean Dyche was quick to dampen expectations after further assessements\u00a0Sean Dyche has confirmed that Seamus Coleman is unlikely to feature for Everton for the rest of the season, just one day after the Toffees captain told fans that he would 'be back soon'.\u00a0",
        "Speaking ahead of the Premier League weekend, which will see his side meet Brighton on Monday, Sean Dyche said that although there was some 'good news' in his prognosis, Coleman would need a spell on the sidelines.\u00a0'[The injury] is still going to keep him out,' the manager said.\u00a0'It's still a ligament injury that needs sorting out, but it's not [what] everyone feared: ACL [anterior cruciate ligament].\u00a0'So that's good news and good news for him.\u00a0",
        "When asked if Coleman was likely to return before May 28, Dyche confirmed: 'Doubt it. I don't think so, no.'\u00a0Coleman has been a sturdy presence in Everton's backline throughout his time at Goodison Park and the timing of his injury could prove critical.\u00a0Everton currently sit 19th in the Premier League and have not recorded a win since their 1-0 victory over Brentford in early March.\u00a0Next Monday's meeting against Roberto De Zerbi's side is only one of the tests that the Toffees will have to endure before the final day of the season.\u00a0They are also yet to face Manchester City, and Bournemouth, who have responded to the threat of relegation with a feisty showing that has seen them win four of their last five matches.\u00a0"
