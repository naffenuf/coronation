The bank said the report was false.Three U.S. regional banks have failed in the last two months, spurring widespread worries about the sector's stability and dashing regulators' hopes of a quick recovery.Regulators had hoped that the sale of First Republic Bank to JPMorgan Chase &amp;amp; Co earlier this week would draw a line under a lingering banking turmoil.On Wednesday, PacWest Bancorp said it was exploring strategic options. The bank was trying to avoid the fate of other regional lenders by proactively finding a solution that bolsters its finances, a source told Reuters.PacWest shares tumbled nearly 50% to a record low on Thursday.
