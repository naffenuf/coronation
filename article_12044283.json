        "The North Carolina High School Athletic Association's board of directors approved a measure permitting athletes to profit from use of their name, image and likeness (NIL) during its spring meeting Wednesday. That change would go into effect July 1 for athletes to profit through activities such as appearances, autographs, group licensing and social media, among other activities.Athletes, parents, coaches, athletics directors and principals must complete an NIL course from the National Federation of High Schools annually. Athletes would be blocked from NIL deals tied to adult entertainment, alcohol, cannabis products, firearms, gambling and tobacco-related products.North Carolina would become the 28th state to permit high school athletes to engage in NIL activities.The Charlotte Observer and The News &amp; Observer of Raleigh reported that another governing body, the North Carolina Independent Schools Athletic Association, is developing its own NIL policy. Executive director Homar Ramirez said that work has been ongoing for more than a year and a policy could be in place ahead of the 2023-24 school year.___AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"
