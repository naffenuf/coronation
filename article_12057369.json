        "However viewers tuning into the coverage on BBC were left baffled to see I'm A Celeb's Jordan Banjo hosting.\u00a0Many took to Twitter confused, believing he had in fact travelled all the way from the South African camp just for the concert.However the latest series of the ITV competition, featuring returning campmates, was actually pre-recorded last summer.\u00a0",
        "Taking to Twitter one wrote: 'Isn't Jordan Banjo meant to still be in South Africa?'.While a another added: 'Bloody hell Jordan Banjo?? Has he left the I'm a Celeb camp this weekend to host the Coronation Concert'.And a third said: 'It's Jordan Banjo and I'm A Celeb isn't live'.\u00a0While another joked that the BBC had spoiled the most recent I'm A Celeb cliffhanger by proving it was the Diversity dancer that was sent packing.\u00a0They said: 'Lol nice job with the cliff hanger, Jordan Banjo is at the Coronation Concert. I take it he got evicted then'.\u00a0Jordan later interviewed\u00a0Olly Murs\u00a0who showed off his muscly arms as he prepared to perform on stage to the crowd of 20,000 people.But the singer 38, was happy to display his toned physique backstage, he insisted earlier in the day that he would not be whipping off his top during his performance.\u00a0On being invited to perform, he said on BBC Radio 2: 'It's a bit surreal but I am so honoured. I am on tour at the moment so only yesterday I saw the stage. It's the biggest thing of my career.",
