        "Captain Martin Odegaard inspired Arsenal to a 2-0 victory at St James\u2019 Park, scoring the opener before Fabian Schar\u2019s own goal made sure of victory.City have a game in hand but when asked what message his side had sent their rivals, Arteta said: \u2018That we are there, that we want to keep digging.\u00a0The prize is there, not too far.\u00a0'The only thing we can do is keep (going) and not turn our backs and lose focus on something else. Be determined every single day. Let\u2019s keep going and see what happens.\u2019",
        "He added: \u2018I said to the players, to win today you\u2019re going to have to be individually the best performance of the season.\u2019\u00a0Odegaard hailed this victory as a \u2018big step\u2019 forward, 12 months after defeat here cost them a Champions League place.\u2018We had to be very smart and to be ugly at times. It is a big step for a young team like ours to come here and do the things we did,\u2019 he said.\u2018Last year here was one of the toughest days of my career, to be honest. After dropping points against Man City, to win against Chelsea and then come here and win shows the mentality.\u00a0'We have to keep going and digging in and fight until the end.\u2019"
