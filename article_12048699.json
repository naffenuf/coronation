        "Tony Smith hailed his Hull FC players for retaining their belief through the bad times after they withstood fierce second-half pressure to beat Wigan and claim a second straight Super League win.",
        "Smith\u2019s men reeled through seven straight defeats earlier this season including a 40-0 derby humbling by neighbours Hull KR, but looked unrecognisable as they surged out to sink the leaders.Early tries from Darnell McIntosh and Jake Clifford \u2013 who would score 10 of his side\u2019s points in their eventual 14-10 win \u2013 set the tone before a thrilling rearguard action saw Smith\u2019s side over the line.Smith said: \u201cI am so happy for the players. We lost seven straight and you could get down and disgruntled and get a defeatist attitude, and they haven\u2019t.\u201cThey\u2019ve been really positive and we kept saying during that time that we wouldn\u2019t be moping around and feeling sorry for ourselves. We just needed to graft through it and get more determined.\u201dThe table now makes distinctly brighter reading for Smith\u2019s men, who had stopped the rot with a win over Huddersfield prior to the international break, but they head to rock-bottom Wakefield next week knowing there is much more to do.\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of improvements still to make in order to get more results,\u201d Smith added. \u201cWe were average in the second half, we still made errors but they did not hurt us much as they have in other games.\u201cWe\u2019ve got some big matches ahead of us and it\u2019s important that we are in the right frame of mind.\u201d",
        "Wigan head coach Matt Peet admitted his side were second best for long periods of the first half, and were punished by Hull\u2019s energy and determination.\u201cSome of our defence wasn\u2019t where it needed to be in the first half and on the whole we amended that in the second half, but execution is what prevented us getting the win,\u201d said Peet.Wigan looked limp for much of the opening period but Iain Thornley\u2019s try on the stroke of half-time gave them hope, and his second straight after the interval set up a grandstand finish.\u201cHull were full of energy and they were motivated. They were flying off the line, they were covering each other and they were diving on loose balls,\u201d added Peet.\u201cFor us there\u2019ll be a lot of what-ifs and if-onlys. It\u2019s about handling the pressure in those big moments. We\u2019ve got to learn and improve and develop, but I won\u2019t be stressing too much.\u201dPeet reserved particular praise for Thornley, whose double marked his first appearance of the season after a long battle to shake off a knee injury.\u201cI thought he was excellent,\u201d added Peet. \u201cHis desire was evident, I loved the way he carried the ball. He worked so hard and I\u2019m so pleased to see him get a performance like that under his belt.\u201d"
