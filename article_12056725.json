        "Cambridge boss Mark Bonner described his side\u2019s remarkable escape from relegation as a \u201cbrilliant achievement\u201d and believes the U\u2019s could be looking at a much brighter future.",
        "United had looked destined for League Two as they sat seven points from safety with nine games remaining but they secured survival on a dramatic final day of the season.A 2-0 success over Forest Green for Bonner\u2019s side saw them climb out of the bottom four for the first time since January, with club stalwart Harrison Dunk and leading scorer Sam Smith netting in the first half.News of MK Dons\u2019 failure to win at Burton sparked wild celebrations at the Abbey Stadium, with Cambridge securing a third season in League One.\u201cWe\u2019re a club on the up,\u201d said Bonner. \u201cYou look at the number of people here; four sides of the stadium full of Cambridge fans. What a day. I was a bit emotional first half.\u201cI said a few weeks back we\u2019re going to need to finish as we started, or even maybe more to make sure that we got across the line. It seemed an improbable task at the time.",
        "\u201cFirstly we had to take it to the last week, then we were trying to take it to the last day, then we needed the football gods to shine on us.\u201cIt\u2019s a brilliant achievement for us to do it. Hopefully this gives us a chance of building and making sure that next year\u2019s a stronger one.",
        "\u201cWhat a way to do it, last day of the season. It\u2019s incredible really. It will be one that sticks in everyone\u2019s mind at the end of a really brutal season.\u201cThe season, the longer it went on, became one where we said we\u2019re going to have to have a fight to stay in it. I\u2019m absolutely thrilled that we have for everybody. I\u2019d say it\u2019s well deserved.\u201dForest Green boss Duncan Ferguson felt weaknesses shown in Sunday\u2019s game summed up his side\u2019s season as they ended the campaign bottom of the table.\u201cWe\u2019ve had a problem with set-plays during the season, that did us for the first goal,\u201d he said.\u201cIt was an end-of-season game for us, really. Of course they were chasing something, but we were always in the game.\u201cWe think we\u2019ve had a genuine shout for a penalty at 2-0 down, so a couple of decisions never went for us, but we lacked a cutting edge.\u201cThe final third really has been a problem most of the season. We\u2019ve not scored enough goals and we can\u2019t even defend the set0plays, so that\u2019s a problem.\u201cI\u2019m always gauging the players, always judging them every day in training to see if we\u2019re going to be good enough for League Two, so we\u2019re always assessing.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s been a tough season, probably even since the January before that we\u2019ve struggled to win games. We\u2019ve lacked that real goalscorer who\u2019s going to stick the ball in the net.\u201d"
