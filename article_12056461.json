        "Children were among those killed in the bloodbath outside H&amp;M in Allen Premium Outlets in Allen, Texas at 3.36pm on Saturday.\u00a0The shooter, now named as\u00a033-year-old Mauricio Garcia, was killed by an unidentified cop - who was on the scene for an unrelated call but rushed over when he heard the gunshots outside the H&amp;M.\u00a0New audio now reveals how the officer made a frantic phone call begging for his colleagues to join him on the scene, radioing: 'I need everybody I got.'\u00a0The officer bravely ran towards the active shooter - who was armed with 60 rounds and had shot over a dozen people by this point - and killed him.About two minutes after first calling for backup, the cop said: 'I got him down.'\u00a0 Minutes later, another voice is heard on the radio saying: 'We got victims. I need an ambulance.'\u00a0The FBI and police raided the dead suspect's Dallas home following the massacre and requested a translator to speak with his family.\u00a0Neighbors say they often saw him wearing a security guard-type uniform, but he was 'very quiet' and had 'very unusual behavior.'\u00a0His gray Dodge Charger, which was seen at the scene, was often parked outside the home.",
        "A stampede of hundreds of shoppers was seen racing out of the complex while gunfire rained out - as security and police attempted to shepherd them to safety.\u00a0",
        "People in the store were frantically ushered into lockable rooms, and when they eventually got the all-clear to come out, they saw the broken windows, trails of blood by the door, and bloodied bodies covered in sheets.\u00a0\u00a0Dashcam video showed gunman\u00a0Mauricio Garcia\u00a0getting out of a car and shooting at people on the sidewalk on Saturday afternoon.\u00a0More than three dozen shots could be heard as the vehicle that was recording the video drove off.The gunman was using an AR-15-style gun during the mass shooting, and was dressed in full tactical SWAT gear.\u00a0Allen Fire Chief Jonathan Boyd confirmed that seven people died at the scene, including the gunman, and then a further two victims died in hospital.\u00a0Three of the wounded were in critical condition in the evening, and four were stable, Boyd said in an update on Saturday night.\u00a0A Dallas-area medical group said it was treating victims as young as five-years-old.\u00a0Investigators confirmed they believe the shooter was working alone, but they have not yet released any motive for the killings.\u00a0\u00a0Fontayne Payton, 35, was at H&amp;M when he heard the sound of gunshots through his headphones. He said: 'It was so loud, it sounded like it was right outside.'I pray it wasn't kids, but it looked like kids,' he said.\u00a0",
        "The bodies were covered in white towels, slumped over bags on the ground. 'It broke me when I walked out to see that.'Payton then saw the body of the dead shooter - which was the only one not covered, he recalled.\u00a0\u00a0",
        "Another witness, Kimberly Blakey, said she and her daughter, 14, were among the crowd of people rushing to flee the parking lot after the gunfire started.She said the raining bullets were 'non-stop.' Her car got shot at during the ordeal as she tried to escape.\u00a0Blakey told CNN: 'I told my daughter to get down. I could hear her start praying.'\u00a0Another witness,\u00a0Sheliza Ramlall, who was in the Nike store when the violence broke out, said: 'I had the most horrifying experience earlier. I was standing in line at the Nike store when all of a sudden people started to scream and run.\u00a0'The people in the doorway saw the man with the gun outside and raised the alarm. All of us in line dropped to the floor and started to crawl looking for a hiding place while falling over each other.\u00a0'I crawled behind the counter. At that moment, I realized that we were right in plain sight and and figured that I needed to get away from the front.\u00a0",
        "'As I looked to the back of the store, I heard someone saying \u2018get to the back, get to the back\u2019 and everyone started running at that point. An employee opened the back door and let us out. We are standing by the roadside shaken, crying, and hugging each other.'Not knowing where the gunman was or what was happening on the other side was terrifying but I wanted to get out of there so I left the crowd and started to flag the cars down to give me a lift.\u00a0'An elderly woman stopped and I hopped in a panic. She started to tell me about the gunshots she heard and drove me to my car. I raced out of there with an elevated heartbeat.\u00a0'I am grateful for our brave first responders who stopped the shooter and helped the people to safety.'",
        "Mayor Ken Fulk said in a statement on Saturday night: 'Today is a tragic day for the City of Allen, our citizens, our friends and visitors who were at the Allen Premium Outlets. We know you are grieving, we are grieving.'Allen is a proud and safe city which makes today's senseless act of violence even more shocking. However, I want to commend our police and fire departments for their quick response.\u00a0",
        "'Their thorough training not to hesitate to move toward the threat likely saved more lives today. We also want to thank all of our surrounding municipalities and law enforcement agencies for offering their assistance at the scene.\u00a0'This collective effort is what makes our North Texas communities united.'\u00a0Texas Governor Greg Abbott described the shooting as an 'unspeakable tragedy.'Steven Spainhouer said he rushed to desperately save a child who had been shot. His own son was working at the H&amp;M store when shots were fired.'I never imagined in 100 years I would be thrust into the position of being the first first responder on the site to take care of people,' he told CBS news.'The first girl I walked up to was crouched down covering her head in the bushes, so I felt for a pulse, pulled her head to the side and she had no face.'\u00a0\u00a0He said she was already beyond saving.Still set on saving the mess of victims, Spainhouer recalled how he then found another child, who survived the barrage of bullets by being covered by his protective mother, who he said was among eight to die by the gunman.Spainhouer added: 'When I rolled the mother over, he came out.'I asked him if he was OK and he said, 'My mom is hurt, my mom is hurt.'",
        "'Rather than traumatize him any more, I pulled him around the corner sat him down and he was covered from head to toe.\u00a0 [It was] like somebody poured blood on him.'\u00a0\u00a0",
        "In recent years, Texas has witnessed some of the most deadly mass shootings in America. Many believe it's due to the state's loosened gun laws which have come into effect in the past few years.In September 2021, a 'constitutional carry' law came into effect, allowing most Texas who legally own a firearm to carry it openly in public without obtaining a permit or training.\u00a0At the time, Gov. Greg Abbott declared that the law 'instilled freedom in the Lone Star State.'\u00a0Just eight months after the pro-gun law was passed, Uvalde, Texas experienced one of the bloodiest school shootings in US history at\u00a0Robb Elementary School. A total of 19 children were killed, along with two teachers, by gunman\u00a0Salvador Ramos.\u00a0The gunman, 18, wrote 'LOL,' an\u00a0acronym for 'laugh out loud,' on a whiteboard using the blood of his innocent victims.\u00a0For years in Texas, Republicans have waved aside efforts to tighten gun laws after mass shootings, and even expanded gun rights after the 2019 attack on a Walmart in El Paso.\u00a0"
