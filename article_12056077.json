        "Pedro Pascal has revealed the touching reason why he always places his hand on his stomach while posing for pictures on the red carpet.\u00a0",
        "The Chilean/American actor, 48, has been a familiar face at the star-studded events for years due to his roles in Game Of Thrones, The Mandalorian and most recently, The Last Of Us.\u00a0Fans have long been left wondering about\u00a0the reason behind his go-to pose for the cameras.\u00a0At the Met Gala on May 1 - where he rocked the red carpet with his bold red look - Pedro once again brought out his signature pose.\u00a0And appearing next to his co-star Bella Ramsey, 19, at the\u00a0Los Angeles FYC Event for HBO's The Last Of Us at the Directors Guild Of America on April 28, Pedro also held his hand to his stomach.\u00a0",
        "Bella looked quizzical at his stance and asked him about the reason behind it.\u00a0He responded: 'You know why? Because my anxiety is right here.'The two then shared a comforting smile between them and Bella nodded in understanding.\u00a0Fans then rushed to Twitter to praise Pedro for his openness and honesty about mental health.\u00a0One said: 'I love how pedro pascal breaks down the barrier for men who go through things that are so invalidated by a certain group of society.\u00a0'He\u2019s so open about everything he supports and believes in, he\u2019s so open about anxiety and bereavement and i love that about him!'",
        "Another added: 'I so deeply adore Pedro Pascal and his willingness to be funny and silly and emotional and strong and sensitive.'\u00a0A third tweeter said: 'Just when I think I can\u2019t love him more.'\u00a0",
        "The duo, who have a father/daughter dynamic on the critically-acclaimed zombie apocalypse show, seemed as cheerful as ever in each other's company.Pedro opted for a white smoking jacket with striped silk detail around the lapel, cuffs, and belt.He wore the jacket over a dark brown untucked shirt with white geometric flowers and baggy metallic grey trousers.Bella, who defines as non-binary, went for an androgynous look, donning a dark navy blue single breasted suit.The star wore the suit over a striped blue shirt with white cuffs. They accessorised the outfit with white patent leather platform shoes and a single gold magnet style ring.They kept their make-up very light, sporting a touch of foundation and pink lipstick. They left their cropped brunette hair down, styled in waves.\u00a0The pair, who Pedro has adorably named 'Beldro', seemed to enjoy the event, grinning as they goofed around on the black carpet.\u00a0It comes after the star's bold look at the Met Gala last week.\u00a0",
        "Pascal's look has already been the talk of the red carpet, rocking an ensemble from Maison Valentino's autumn/winter 2023 ready-to-wear line.",
        "He stepped out with a bright red trench coat under a matching red dress shirt and a black tie, while showing off his muscular legs with a pair of black shorts.He completed his look with black socks and shiny black combat boots, while rocking a scruffy beard, slicked-back hair and gold rings.\u00a0"
