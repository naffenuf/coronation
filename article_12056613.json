        "Lincoln secured an 11th-placed finish in League One with Matty Virtue\u2019s 73rd-minute strike giving them a hard-fought 1-0 win over Shrewsbury.",
        "The visitors started the better and Luke Leahy\u2019s 15-yard effort after seven minutes deflected against the angle of crossbar and post.From the resulting corner, Imps goalkeeper Carl Rushworth saved well from Chey Dunkley\u2019s downward header.Ryan Bowman shinned one wide before City finally had an effort at goal, Paudie O\u2019Connor heading well off target.The second half was just over a minute old when Rob Street powerfully headed Taylor Moore\u2019s cross against the City bar before Rushworth stood strong to chest away Jordan Shipley\u2019s strike.Lincoln finally called Shrewsbury\u2019s keeper into action after 70 minutes when Virtue\u2019s stinging effort from the edge of the box was pushed out by the diving Marko Marosi.",
        "Virtue wasn\u2019t to be denied three minutes later, though, when Sean Roughan\u2019s long throw into the box fell to the midfielder who buried a shot into the bottom corner.The same player had a taste for goal and curled another effort just over as City finally found their rhythm.Imps striker Ben House then had a shot cleared off the line after great work from sub Jovon Makama and then Max Sanders fired straight at Marosi.City should have doubled their lead at the death after House was dragged down by Dunkley just inside the area, with the defender shown a straight red card, but Sanders\u2019 penalty was superbly saved by Marosi."
