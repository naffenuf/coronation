        "Prince Louis got stuck in to some wall hand painting alongside his dad WilliamRead More: Prince Louis gets behind controls of a JCB on his first engagement\u00a0Prince Louis showed off his cheeky side yet again this afternoon as he got stuck in to a spot of hand painting with his dad Prince William.\u00a0\u00a0",
        "The Prince of Wales\u00a0and wife Kate were joined by their children Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis during a visit to the 3rd Upton Scouts Hut in Slough, west of London on Monday, where they were tasked with helping improve the building.\u00a0Inside the scout hut the family, including Louis, added their handprints to a tree on the wall made up of all those who have contributed to the volunteer effort.One followed volunteer asked Louis: \u2018You might want to be a painter when you grow up?\u2019\u2018No a fighter pilot,\u2019 he responded.\u2018Just like your father and grandfather!\u2019 the lady replied.",
        "\u2018Hey poppet,\u2019 said Kate to Louis as her younger child delightedly grabbed a brush. She encouraged him to paint her hand first, liberally covering it with yellow paint.He then led his mother by the hand and encouraged him to place her hand on the wall. \u2018Ready, steady, go. Good job!\u2019 Kate smiled.But that clearly wasn\u2019t going to be enough for Louis and, as his mother washed her hands, he went off to get some paint for himself.He first chose some yellow paint and started putting it on his hands with the princess\u2019s encouragement before make his own handprint. \u2018Good job,\u2019 Kate said.Louis decided to have a go again, looking carefully to make sure every spot of skin was covered, before finding another spot on the mural to place his hand. \u2018Do you want to put it next to me?\u2019 asked Kate.",
        "Louis washed his hands carefully - but then decided that simply wasn\u2019t enough. He covered his mother\u2019s, and then his own hand, with blue paint. \u2018One more!\u2019 he urged her.They were then joined by Charlotte who wanted to make her own. \u2018We are running about of space. Oh look there\u2019s a gap there,' said Kate, pointing to a spot.Louis proudly pointed out his handprints. \u2018Look! There, there, there and there!\u2019People across Britain were asked to do their duty as the celebrations for King Charles III's coronation drew to a close with a massive volunteering drive today.Earlier in the day Louis sat operating a digger with his father while his brother and sister watched with a hint of nerves.The young prince missed the Coronation Concert last night because it was past his bedtime, but he got down to business and was operating a mini JCB.And it didn't end there, Kate was seen pushing a wheelbarrow while her youngest son shoveled in sand as they helped spruce up a Slough scout hut.\u00a0He then took control, steering it expertly as his mum supported its weight.When his work was done he devoured marshmallows with his father, who was heard declaring: 'You've made his day' as he chomped on a S'more.",
        "Charlotte was seen delightedly running to help prepare a new path while George, a future king himself, was spotted learning how to use a power drill. All three young Waleses had a crack at archery too.",
        "The couple and their three children were out and about again to mark the third day of the King\u2019s Coronation, and Charles III's life of service.The Princess of Wales has been Joint President of the Scouts since 2020 and the royals joined volunteers resetting a path, digging a new soakaway, sanding and revarnishing the front door, adding planters to the front of the building and adding a mural to create a lasting legacy of the Big Help Out\u2019s work.William and Kate attended in support of the Big Help Out along with other senior royals including the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh, the Princess Royal and the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester.Princess Anne and her husband, Vice Admiral Sir Timothy Lawrence, are at a civic service recognising local volunteers at Gloucester Cathedral, which will be followed by a special reception for invited volunteers and charity representatives from across Gloucestershire.",
        "Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh, as a patron of Guide Dogs, is attending a puppy training class at the Guide Dogs Training Centre in Reading with her husband, Prince Edward.",
        "There are over 8million opportunities to get involved today, with more than 52,000 events happening across the nation.The 3rd Upton Scouts Hut was built in 1982 and is used by a variety of community groups in the area, including the local mosque, a senior citizens contact group for members of the Asian community and the Scout group themselves.The building is also used by \u2018Slough All Nations,\u2019 a group with heritage spanning across St. Kitts &amp; Nevis, and which provides recreation and leisure activities to improve health and wellbeing and promote community cohesion."
