        "Between 1948 and 2004, 376 injuries and 15 fatalities as a result of alligator attacks had been reported across the United States.Alligator interactions with humans become more likely the more people spend near water, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, but alligators will seldom attack if unprovoked.The probability of being injured in an unprovoked attack is about one in 3,100,000."
