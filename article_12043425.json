Pitchers have 15 seconds to throw a pitch with no runners on base and 20 seconds with men aboard, otherwise an automatic ball is called. Hitters are allowed one timeout per at-bat and must be in the batter's box with at least eight seconds left on the clock, otherwise an automatic strike is called.According to the data, games are averaging 2 hours and 37 minutes this season, down from 3 hours and 5 minutes in 2022.The last time games were this short was the 1981 season.--Field Level Media"
