        "The biggest names in show business will be more likely to include Sydney in their global concert tours with the annual cap on concerts at Allianz stadium set to lift.",
        "The SCG precinct and new $828 million Sydney Football Stadium is now restricted to hosting just four concerts a year but the premier wants that raised to 20.\"It is a message to the rest of Australia and the whole world that Sydney is open for business,\" Chris Minns said on Wednesday.Venues NSW will seek regulatory approval to lift the cap, paving the way for major international acts that will bring in millions of dollars a year in economic activity and boost tourism and jobs.\"If Sydney ... is going to be active and have an energy to it, then it can't act like the town from Footloose,\" Mr Minns said.\"We can't try and stop all activity after dark. We have to be an economy that's open at night time.\"The move comes after negotiations for Allianz to host Beyonce's upcoming world tour fell over after the venue was unable to overcome issues from long-standing noise complaints.The premier said he was aware of noise concerns from locals but said people who chose to live near a stadium needed to be accommodating.\"It's not your own personal fiefdom, it's not your own personal backyard. This stadium belongs to the people of NSW,\" Mr Minns said.Music and Night-time Economy Minister John Graham says lifting the restrictions will boost Sydney's chances of securing international touring artists.",
        "\"It's partly about the signal this sends to the rest of the world,\" he said.\"Every time Sydney says no to Beyonce, that word travels around the world.\"Lifting the concert cap to 20 per year could bring in an additional $1.3 billion for NSW businesses across the lifetime of the stadium.The restriction has meant that Venues NSW has been unable to host international artists such as the Foo Fighters, Bon Jovi, Billy Joel and Beyonce.Each international artist is estimated to bring in between $5m and $7.5m per show of economic benefit to the NSW economy, supporting thousands of jobs.The cap was costing the NSW economy between $40 to $60 million a year, Mr Minns said.Stakeholders including local community groups, major operators, surrounding landowners, neighbours, and local businesses would be consulted about the change.The cap could be lifted as soon as October.Business Sydney Executive Director Paul Nicolaou welcomed the move.\"Sydney needs to be a magnet for world-class artists - the performers who can fill a stadium because of the size of their talent and their fan following,\" he said."
