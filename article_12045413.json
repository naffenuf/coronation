        "Overcoming women's economic disadvantage will be a priority in the Albanese government's second budget, with spending targeted at women likely to suffer the most as the economy slows.",
        "Katy Gallagher, who holds the finance and women portfolios, said the federal government made a start on women's economic inequality in the October budget and planned to advance this work in its follow-up edition due next Tuesday.Similarly to October last year, the government is delivering a budget at a time of coalescing pressures.Labor made some expensive election commitments, including on health, education and continuing the stage three tax cuts, and at a time when government finances were already deep in the red after the pandemic.And inflation remains high and sticky, which has prompted aggressive interest rate hikes from the Reserve Bank and is restricting how much cost of living relief the government can hand out.While Australia is expected to avoid a recession, Senator Gallagher told AAP the government was mindful budget investments should be targeted at areas that would make the biggest difference during the upcoming period of slowing growth.\"And some of that is addressing support for the most disadvantaged women,\" she said.During the pandemic, studies showed women were more likely to lose their jobs and suffered more mentally as extra time spent doing homeschooling and unpaid took a toll.But Senator Gallagher said the strong labour market would help to soften the blow for women during the latest set of economic challenges.",
        "\"The participation rate for women, while it lags men, is reasonably strong compared to where it's been in the past,\" she said.While she was unable to confirm speculation a long-awaited boost to the JobSeeker income support would be isolated to over-55s, she said it was no secret women in the age bracket were a growing demographic on this payment long term.Similarly, changes to the single-parent payment - also yet to be formally announced - would largely flow to struggling single mothers.In line with a recommendation from the women's economic equality task force, the government has signalled interest in lifting the age of eligibility for this payment to when a parent's youngest child reaches the age of 13 or 14.At the moment, once a child reaches eight, parents are pushed off the payment onto the lower JobSeeker amount.Of the task force's six chief recommendations, the government has committed to abolishing the ParentsNext program, which is essentially a subset of JobSeeker for people with young children that has hard-to-meet mutual obligations attached.Senator Gallagher said there would also be a \"comprehensive response\" to two other key priority items from the task force - reforming the childcare activity test, which significantly restricts access to subsidised care for some families, and lifting the wages of childcare workers."
