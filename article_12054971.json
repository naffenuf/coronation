        "She is always so poised and well-prepared when it comes to Royal engagements, but it seems the Princess of Wales is a stranger to one thing \u2013 the fact that a pint glass is a standard size.",
        "Emerging from the Dog And Duck pub in Soho on Thursday, where William pulled a pint of Kingmaker pale ale, Kate told wellwishers: \u2018I asked for a cider and got a massive pint of cider.\u2019\u00a0Meanwhile, it seems William was a little stressed by his wife\u2019s leisurely walkabout pace and was overheard telling aides that she needed to \u2018speed up\u2019. It\u2019s a good thing they didn\u2019t organise the Coronation together!",
        "No wonder there wasn\u2019t a speck of dust to be found inside Westminster Abbey. At one of the rehearsals last week, those practising their ceremonial roles had to wear blue overshoes \u2013 the sort you would normally find at the local lido \u2013 over their footwear.\u00a0The King may be the first monarch to be fluent in Welsh since Elizabeth I, but TV presenter Gethin Jones reveals the late Queen also had a handle on the notoriously tricky language.\u00a0Gethin, 45, tells me: \u2018I met her and spoke Welsh to her and she replied in Welsh \u2013 it was very natural how she did it.\u2019There was a strong Welsh tribute at yesterday\u2019s ceremony \u2013 bass-baritone Sir Bryn Terfel sang a Welsh-language song with the Westminster Abbey choir, while Royal harpist Alis Huws \u2013 a role reinstated by the King during his tenure as Prince of Wales \u2013 is from Powys.",
        "Tom Pettifer, who was a page boy at the wedding of the Prince and Princess of Wales back in 2011, was determined to be part of the historic event \u2013 but had to make do with watching from a spot in The Mall in order to get a glimpse of the action.Tom, 20, who is the godson of Prince William and whose mother, Tiggy Legge-Bourke, was nanny to the two Princes, set up camp with friends and his Army father Charles yesterday \u2013 and was spotted enjoying a can of lager as he waited for events to start."
