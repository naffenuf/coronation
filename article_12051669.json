        "Henderson has spent the season on loan at Nottingham Forest from Man United\u00a0He picked up an injury in January and underwent an operation earlier this week\u00a0The 26-year-old goalkeeper is likely to want to leave Old Trafford in the summer\u00a0Dean Henderson will remain with Nottingham Forest until the end of the season even though the on-loan Manchester United goalkeeper is to miss the rest of the campaign with injury.",
        "Henderson has undergone surgery on a torn thigh muscle this week and it is unclear when he will be able to return.\u00a0Yet even though he may never play for Forest again, Henderson is still spending time with his current team-mates at the training ground and on matchdays.\u2018We have all enjoyed working with him,\u2019 said Forest boss Steve Cooper. \u2018We like his personality, he is a good professional and has a fantastic mentality. In terms of whether we will work with him again, it\u2019s hard to say.\u2018We are grateful for what he has given and what he will still give us. He will still be around and quite visible.",
        "\u2018Our medical team is working with United\u2019s over what they want our contribution to be towards his recovery. In terms of support, he will be with us until the end, which is what he would want.\u2019'We have a good working relationship with United and communication. It is still fresh after the surgery for what his recovery plan will be. We wish him well.'Henderson\u2019s last appearance for Forest was the 2-0 win over Leicester on January 14. His injury prompted Forest to sign Keylor Navas on loan from Paris St Germain, and the Costa Rican has played ever since.",
        "Navas\u2019 form has fluctuated during his time at the City Ground and he will have a vital role to play in the final four games of the season. Forest are in the bottom three but can climb out if they beat Southampton at home on Monday and other results work in their favour."
