        "Lewis Hamilton has raised the remarkable prospect of extending his Formula One career into his fifties on the eve of this weekend\u2019s Miami Grand Prix.",
        "Hamilton has only six months to run on his current \u00a340million-a-year deal at Mercedes, but both sides say a contract extension \u2013 which is set to carry the seven-time world champion beyond his 40th birthday \u2013 will be agreed.Hamilton, 38, is the second-oldest driver on the F1 grid behind Fernando Alonso. The Spaniard, 42 in July, is enjoying an upturn in his career with his rejuvenated Aston Martin team.",
        "Hamilton is also heavily involved in a new Hollywood F1 blockbuster starring Brad Pitt. The 59-year-old American actor will play the role of a former driver emerging from retirement.It emerged here in Miami that Pitt is set to drive an adapted Formula Two car during filming for the movie at the British Grand Prix in July.\u201cYou can never say never,\u201d said Hamilton, when asked about his longevity and the possibility of competing against Alonso in his fifties.\u201cBrad is going to be racing in the movie in his fifties, so I would be the third-oldest driver.\u201cThere are people out there like Tom Brady [who retired, aged 45]. There are different ways you can train, how you can eat, and your focus.\u201cThe technology in our bodies is shifting, and it is just about the mentality and whether or not you still have the drive to sacrifice the same as you did when you first started, and I do.",
        "\u201cI cannot speak for Fernando but I am hoping for more great fights with him moving forward.\u201dJuan Manuel Fangio is the oldest man to win a world championship. The Argentine captured his fifth title when he was 46 in 1957.Hamilton was then asked if the physical demands of the sport\u2019s gruelling record-breaking calendar are impacting his recovery.But the Mercedes man replied: \u201cIt is not taking me longer to recover. It is better because I am more focused on recovery than I ever have been before.\u201cWhen I was 22, I was not focused on recovery. I didn\u2019t know anything about it. I was just going home having a pizza, and not knowing what I needed to do the next day.\u201cI did not have any specialists around me to help me navigate that. I didn\u2019t have the details of what to eat, how to replenish the liquids I lost, stretching, and all those different things.\u201cI wasn\u2019t doing that back then. I don\u2019t know if the drivers back in the day were that fit. They probably fell off quicker than us because we train a lot more than they did.\u201dHamilton remains motivated to win a record eighth title. However, the British driver is on the longest losing streak of his F1 career.",
        "Red Bull have won 14 of the last 15 races with Hamilton already 45 points behind championship leader Max Verstappen after just four rounds.And Hamilton warned Red Bull\u2019s dominance could last until 2026 if the current regulations \u2013 ironically introduced last year to make the racing closer \u2013 are not changed.\u201cWe need to do better as a sport,\u201d said Hamilton. \u201cThey have tried to bring the teams closer but it never seems to work.\u201cIt is good that we are trying new things and evolving, but it is just unfortunate that we see the same kind of gaps between teams.\u201cI don\u2019t know what the solution is for the future but we have to continue to adapt the regulations otherwise it could be the same as it is now until 2026.\u201d"
