        "WASHINGTON, May 4 (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department on Thursday said it was continuing to monitor market developments amid sharp drops in the shares of regional lenders PacWest Bancorp &amp;lt;PACW.O and Western Alliance Bancorp, but deposit flows were stable.",
        "\"We continue to closely monitor market developments,\" a Treasury official said. \"The banking system has substantial liquidity and deposit flows are stable.\"Shares of Los Angeles-based PacWest were down 60% after the lender confirmed it was exploring strategic options. Western Alliance's stock was down 58.2%, despite a statement from the bank saying it had no unusual deposit outflows and had adequate liquidity.Experts say the share price moves do not reflect the banks' fundamentals and are likely a result of short-selling activity following the collapse of First Republic Bank and its sale to JPMorgan Chase &amp;amp; CO on Monday.First Republic was the third major casualty of the biggest crisis to hit the U.S. banking sector since 2008.
