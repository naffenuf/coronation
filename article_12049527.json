        "Interior decorator Nicole Rosenberg shares her styling tipsShe said to embrace colour this seasonShe revamped an 'uninviting' dining room into a vibrant space\u00a0An interior designer has revealed how she transformed a 'dull and uninviting' dining room into a chic and vibrant space, saying renovators should never be afraid to use colour.",
        "Nicole Rosenberg, an interior decorator from Liberty Interiors, was tasked with 'injecting personality' into her client's dining space.The home stylist is known for her daring colour schemes and used bold hues throughout the room to make it a talking point during family's dinner parties.\u00a0She adorned the walls with two shades of gender-neutral greens with pops of pastel pinks, deep blues and ruby reds in the furniture and accents around the room.\u00a0Nicole also shared her tips and tricks to revamp a room and embrace colour without breaking the bank.\u00a0",
        "'Prior to the revamp, the room lacked any personality and was really dull and uninviting - the opposite effect that my clients wanted when they were hosting their weekly dinner parties with friends,' Nicole told FEMAIL.\u00a0She said she wanted to make an attention-grabbing space with 'bold and exuberant' colours that could also withstand the 'hustle and bustle' that comes with having small children.\u00a0'Once the palette was introduced to the project concept, we could all see that it was a match made in heaven and solidified the intent of the room from the beginning,' she explained.\u00a0",
        "'It was important that the room steered clear of gender-skewed shades, so we settled on a predominantly green colour palette.'She used two greens on the walls, the darker shade on the bottom and a paler tone stretching up to the ceiling to 'give the entire room added dimension' and 'create a sense of height and grandeur'.\u00a0",
        "The ceiling was painted a crisp white to 'offset' the space while decorative elements added texture and interest to complete the look while the door was given a calming blue hue.'The bold combination of all three colours work so beautifully together and evoke a sense of playfulness and fun,' Nicole said.Decorative pieces included the scalloped shared glassware, chequered blue rug and quirky pink and red dining chairs.\u00a0",
        "1. Painting the bottom half of the room a darker colour: If you are working with a smaller space and worried that adding a splash of colour will only make it feel smaller, try painting the bottom half of your walls a darker colour. This is a great way to make a room appear bigger, especially if you select a lighter colour on the top half that will easily blend into the ceiling.2. Keep your colour selection personal:\u00a0Choose a colour that speaks to your personality, and creativity rather than opting for what is 'on trend'.3. Paint all four walls in a space: Feature walls can make your space feel smaller, especially if you commit to bold and bright colours, and can cut off the effortless flow of the room that you are transforming.4. Sample Pots or Colour Stickers:\u00a0For colour surety, order A4 Colour Stickers or Sample Pots from dulux.com.au in your chosen colours, so that you can readily view them in your home's natural lighting conditions.",
        "HOW TO GAIN YOUR COLOUR CONFIDENCE\u00a0Nicole said it's always worth taking a 'leap of faith' with colour rather than keeping things neutral as walls and furniture can always be painted over again should you change your mind.\u00a0Colour blocking has risen in popularity in interior trends since the beginning of the Covid pandemic when people were confined to their homes.\u00a0'Many of us have started looking to incorporate a sense of lightness and joy into our surroundings. Bold stylistic choices that we turned our backs on are now coming to the forefront, as we all look for fun, freedom and chance to try new things,' Nicole said.\u00a0'We are all becoming much more interested in cultivating a living space that not only highlights our own personality, but as a way to get our creative juices flowing after a time of very little stimulation.'Below Nicole shares her hot five tips every home style lover should consider to gain some 'colour confidence' whether it be during a full renovation or a small room revamp.\u00a0",
        "1. GO FOR BOLD DARKER TONES IF YOU HAVE YOUNG KIDSNicole recommends parents with young children go for colour over\u00a0neutral tones, especially in high traffic areas that are likely to get scuffed and marked in the inevitable chaos of having a busy family.",
        "'If you choose a white or light colour for walls you'll probably spend a lot of time cleaning off marks and scratches, especially in bedrooms, hallways and dining rooms,' she said.\u00a0Nicole said families should opt for bold, darker tones that will hide any blemishes or dirt.\u00a0'On top of this, bringing colour into your space is a fantastic chance to teach your little ones about colour and how it can be used positively as a form of creative expression throughout their lives,' she said.\u00a0",
        "1. Use what you've got: Take a look at your surroundings and if you're on a tight budget, opt for simple changes. A quick and easy rearrangement of your furniture's positioning or moving around items to different areas in the house may be just the refresh that your space needs.2. Layering and texture: Consider layering a variety of fun patterns and textures through soft touches such as cushions, rugs and colourful vessels.3. Colour is key: Whether it be through accessories or a fresh lick of paint, incorporating even one pop of colour can give your space a new lease on life.4. Use your imagination: Start to create a mood board or list of items that you could easily collect from second-hand shops or around sale time to inject colour into your home",

COLOUR IN THE UNEXPECTED\u00a0'As with many working families, many of us simply don't have the time or budget to splash out on refurbishing an entire home,' Nicole said adding there are many creative ways to integrate colour in their homes.\u00a0'Some of my own favourite additions include a colourful rug, bright and bold accessories, a striking statement piece of furniture or introducing a single eye-catching paint colour to your space,' she said.",
        "Homeowners can even add a pops of colour quickly by painting small furniture items, doors and trims in a room to give a space vibrancy without breaking the bank.'It is always important to choose colours that resonate with you, and the feel of your home so that there is a consistent look throughout your entire space,' Nicole said.\u00a0",
        "4. GET SMART AND PLAN AHEADNicole suggests creating a mood board to gain inspiration, collate ideas and gain more colour confidence before jumping into re-styling a room.\u00a0'This can be a great source of inspiration creatively further down your painting journey and gives you a chance to get excited about the new journey of your space,' she said.The interior decorator said people often make the mistake of not taking the time to properly plan out a transformation before starting.\u00a0She said be careful not to over-estimate how much space you have and purchase furniture that doesn't fit and not come up with an adequate budget plan.Nicole also recommends testing preferred paint colours with sample pots before covering a whole wall.\u00a0'Coming up with clear objectives and intent will ensure that you make as little mistakes as possible,' she said.\u00a0",
