        "Former EastEnders star Joe, 41, offered to give Dean, 45, a shave because there are no mirrors in camp and it seems they both enjoyed the experience.\u00a0Admitting they 'like the contact,' Dean couldn't help but notice that Joe is 'tender and soft with his hands.'\u00a0\u00a0Getting to grips with the razor, Joe asked Dean: 'Are you down or up when you do yours?''Up that way,' he replied.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",
        "Joe continued: 'That's coming off quite well when you do it slowly.'Dean who also used to star in EastEnders, said: ' The problem is in here, you don't have a mirror so you can't see yourself when you're having a shave.'Joe has come in and is helping a friend out. He's quite tender and quite soft with his hands.'Joe, who is married to Stacey Solomon, said: 'This is so weird isn't it, what has happened to us.'We were in Ocean Beach Club on my stag do a couple of months ago having it large and now look at us.'\u00a0Talking to the camera, Joe said: 'I just like that contact and luckily Deb is the same as me.'Then looking at the results of the shave, Joe concluded: 'Ah you look better, look at me. That's knocked about five years off you Gaffney. '",

I didn't even leave at the end of the episode.'So usually you leave at the end of the episode and you get the 'doof doof'.'Mine, I went to Norwich to be a bell boy at a hotel and mid scene I just walked into the Vic and went, 'Right, see you later'.'They turned back to Phil, turned back to me and I'd gone. I was like, 'What, that's it?' I was there five years and not one doof doof!'",
        "Speaking in the Bush Telegraph, Joe reiterated EastEnders have not reached out to him to return.",
        "He said:\u00a0'People think I can phone up EastEnders and go, 'I'm ready to come back now guys'.'They have not phoned me. Let me make this clear\u2026 EastEnders have never phoned me to get me back on the show.'Just a few months after leaving EastEnders, Joe took part in I'm A Celebrity and was crowned King of the Jungle.\u00a0He then went on to present I'm A Celebrity's spin-off series a year after being crowned 'King of the Jungle'.In 2010, he met his now wife Stacey Solomon, who had also just won the series, and the pair started dating.
