        "Sven-Goran Eriksson named 17-year-old Theo Walcott in his provisional England World Cup squad on this day in 2006, despite the forward not having played in the Premier League for Arsenal.",
        "Walcott became England\u2019s youngest international when he played in a pre-tournament friendly against Hungary.But he did not make an appearance at the tournament as England reached the quarter-finals but lost to Portugal after Wayne Rooney\u2019s red card.",
        "Walcott was no stranger to making history at a tender age. He had become Southampton\u2019s youngest ever player when he featured in a 0-0 Championship draw at home to Wolves aged 16 and 143 days, then became their youngest goalscorer with a strike in a 2-1 defeat to Leeds two months later.His early promise persuaded Arsenal to sign him for an initial \u00a35million, potentially rising to \u00a312m, in January 2006, but he had been kept waiting for his first-team chance before Eriksson came calling in the summer.Walcott got the news of his selection from his dad, and later said: \u201cI thought he was having me on. I was shocked and surprised as everyone was; my eyes were just popping out of my head.\u201dEriksson admitted at the time the selection was \u201ca gamble\u201d but he felt Walcott\u2019s pace could offer England a wild card option.",
        "But the Swede later admitted he did not help Walcott when saying the player had never quite reached the levels expected of him.\u201cMaybe the expectations on him were too high, and maybe I didn\u2019t help him there,\u201d Eriksson told OLBG last year.",
        "Walcott went on to earn 47 England caps, but agreed his first call-up came too soon.\u201cI was thrown into the limelight straight away having not even played a Premier League game,\u201d he said.\u201cSuddenly you are surrounded by these top-quality players and you are thinking \u2018do I deserve to be here?\u2019\u201d"
