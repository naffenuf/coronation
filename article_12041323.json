The scenery is amazing, our rich history and culture makes St. Kitts unique but it's the vibe of Kittitians that make the island unforgettable.The most beautiful sunsets can be found at the Timothy Hill look-out point where the Caribbean Sea meets the Atlantic Ocean and also at Sunset Reef with its unobstructed water views.St. Kitts is simply a gem on its own. It remains authentic in every avenue, and I think that is what differentiates the island from other neighbouring islands.Danielle Weekes of St. Kitts Tourism Authority\u00a0",
