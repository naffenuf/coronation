        "His account was locked after a row with an anti-cycling group leaderConcern is growing among BBC bosses over Vine\u2019s anti-motorist tweetingREAD MORE:\u00a0Pedestrian says cycling BBC star was endangered himThe Radio 2 host Jeremy Vine was suspended from Twitter for breaking its \u2018hateful content\u2019 rule by naming a woman campaigning against a cycle lane.",
        "The cycling enthusiast\u2019s account was locked after he was reported over the row with the woman who runs an anti-cycling group in Chiswick, west London, where he lives.It was part of his crusade to keep what has been described as a \u2018dangerous\u2019 cycling lane on a main road in the neighbourhood.The Mail can also reveal that concern is growing among BBC bosses over Vine\u2019s regular anti-motorist tweeting. Some fear he could be at risk of breaking the corporation\u2019s impartiality regulations.One source compared his social media activity to that of Match of the Day host Gary Lineker, who earlier this year was taken off air for saying the Government\u2019s Rwanda refugee policy \u2018reminds us of the debate in Germany in the 1930s\u2019.",
        "A BBC insider said: \u2018[Vine] hasn\u2019t been reined in but it is becoming an issue and has certainly been noted by some of the executives. The view is very much \u201cwatch this space.\u201d\u2019Last week Vine, 57, who earns \u00a3240,000-\u00a3294,999 for his Radio 2 lunchtime shows, was locked out of Twitter where he has 788,000 followers. The social media giant said: \u2018We locked @thejeremyvine\u2019s account for breaking our hateful content rule. We found they broke our hateful content rule through different reports we received about their behaviour.\u2019",
        "It came after Vine accused a woman who runs a group called One Chiswick of allowing abuse to take place on her social media.The group has campaigned for the redesign or removal of what it says is a \u2018dangerous\u2019 cycle lane along Chiswick High Road that Vine uses.Under Twitter\u2019s terms of service, offending tweets have to be taken down for accounts to be unlocked.The Mail searched Vine\u2019s Twitter timeline for the message at the centre of the row but could not find it.The presenter said yesterday: \u2018So far as I know my account was not locked down; all my tweets comply with Twitter\u2019s rules; none of them has been removed. The whole thing is a bit of a mystery.\u2019A BBC spokesman said: \u2018Jeremy is aware of his duty under the BBC\u2019s social media guidelines.\u2019\u2022 This article has been amended since it was originally published to correct the name of Jeremy Vine\u2019s Twitter account."
