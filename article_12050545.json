        "The crowning of the King and Queen Consort will \u201cdraw on the long and rich history\u201d of the Crown Jewels and coronations but it will also do away with some traditions, a royal historian has said.",
        "On Saturday, the eyes of the world will be on Westminster Abbey as Charles and Camilla take part in the coronation ceremony, which will feature a number of the nation\u2019s most precious treasures, including St Edward\u2019s Crown, the Robe Royal and the Sovereign\u2019s Orb.The sacred, priceless objects are part of the Crown Jewels \u2013 the nation\u2019s most precious treasures \u2013 which are held in trust by the King for the country and kept under armed guard in the Tower of London.",
        "Charles Farris, a public historian and expert on the Crown Jewels and the history of coronations, told Sky News that the coronation regalia will play a \u201cvery central role\u201d in the ceremony.\u201cRegalia just means objects symbolic of kingship, and the coronation regalia are those objects used in the coronation itself,\u201d he said.\u201cMore famously, you have objects like crowns and orbs and sceptres which are part of the investiture regalia, these will be given to the monarch symbolic of their royal powers and responsibilities.\u201cBut there\u2019ll be a number of other important objects as well and these form the heart of the Crown Jewels collection.\u201d",
        "However, Mr Farris noted that some past coronation traditions are no longer performed, including the monarch processing through the streets of London from the Tower of London to Westminster the day before the ceremony.",
        "He recalled that King Charles II was the last monarch to do so in 1661 but that it had been part of the spectacle for hundreds of years before this.Despite its omission, Mr Farris noted the coronation will still be \u201csteeped in pageantry\u201d and \u201cdraw on the long and rich history of not only the Crown Jewels but also coronations and British history as well\u201d.\u201cCoronations look to the traditions of the past and they use the regalia which have been used for hundreds of years,\u201d he added.Mr Farris also explained that the earlier medieval coronation regalia were destroyed at the Tower of London in 1649 and new ones had to be made after the restoration for the coronation of King Charles II.He revealed that a few items still remain and that these will form part of the coronation procession and ceremony."
