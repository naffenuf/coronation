        "And in the approach to the Coronation Eclipse, we don\u2019t need to be Luke Skywalker to feel pulled by cosmic forces.Reacting to imaginary threats can compromise our emotional security. But (luckily for us) the Eclipse isn\u2019t the Death Star! By sensitively moving forward there are ways to combat challenges.Aries\u00a0Mar 21 - Apr 20\u00a0Even people we admire for their kindness aren\u2019t perfect. No one is. Sometimes, even when our intentions are good, we take actions that impede others. Offering to lend a helping hand to one person might hamper someone else. If you feel as though you\u2019re being undermined, try not to take it personally. Don\u2019t assume you\u2019re being provoked, or that the action is meant to affect you. Instead, seek a positive way to move on. Don\u2019t waste energy feeling hard done by when you can achieve so much.\u00a0To hear uplifting news about the possibilities this month brings, call your May prediction: 0906 751 5601.",
        "Taurus\u00a0Apr 21 - May 21\u00a0We should be thankful for moments of weakness. They enable us to evolve and grow. They teach us lessons we can\u2019t learn in any other way. They open our eyes and touch our hearts. We don\u2019t stop to question ourselves when things are going well. It\u2019s only when they go pear-shaped that we have to search our souls. In doing so, we make discoveries that can profoundly change our lives. You\u2019ve been obliged to reflect recently. The Coronation Eclipse enables you to put your realisations to excellent use.\u00a0",
        "There\u2019s so much to tell you about the month ahead, and you\u2019re going to love it! For great news, call 0906 751 5602.Gemini\u00a0May 22 - June 22\u00a0No matter how our experience of life forces us to change our expectations, and how hard the world tries to mould us into shape, some dreams never die. Just because we don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be able to fulfil an ambition doesn\u2019t mean we abandon it. We just put it in a safe place, in a quiet corner of our mind, and wait for the right moment. There\u2019s something you\u2019ve always wanted to do. Under these powerful skies, it\u2019s worth taking that dream out, dusting it off and looking for an opportunity to realise it.\u00a0The month of May brings the potential to make your dreams come true. Call your four-minute forecast: 0906 751 5603.Cancer\u00a0June 23 - July 23You\u2019re dealing with a difficult, contentious issue in your personal life, connected to a material or worldly matter. But the real problem is the way people respond to the issue. Although it would be easy to get pulled into the maelstrom, it would be much more helpful if you could stand back and detach yourself from the swirling emotions. If you can manifest calm, others will pick up your vibe. It\u2019s better to make slow progress around this emotional trouble-spot than keep falling into it. If you don\u2019t usually call your forecast, this is the month to do it!\u00a0",
        "Your May prediction has brilliant news. Call 0906 751 5604.\u00a0Leo\u00a0July 24 - Aug 23As members of the \u2018human race\u2019, maybe we\u2019re meant to be constantly under pressure and racing around! Maybe our arrival on planet Earth is accompanied by a celestial starting gun \u2014 ready, set, go! And we\u2019re off. Yet the problem is when we\u2019re racing, we become less humane. We\u2019re so focused on doing what we\u2019re doing that we don\u2019t appreciate the magical moments life brings our way. Although you have lots on your plate, make time for yourself today. The Eclipse brings reasons to feel (and share) joy.\u00a0Welcome to an exciting month! May\u2019s cosmic events could transform your life! Find out how! Call 0906 751 5605.",
        "Virgo\u00a0Aug 24 - Sep 23\u00a0If you resolve to conquer a mountain peak, there\u2019s a reasonable chance you\u2019ll succeed. If you want to swim across an ocean, then (as long as you\u2019ve got adequate support and have completed the proper training) you could do it. If, however, you\u2019re hoping to do both those things, you might have bitten off more than you can chew. The Coronation Eclipse is energising you. Your task is to direct that energy towards one plan or project. If you focus on what\u2019s most important, you can make spectacular progress.\u00a0",

Call 0906 751 5606.Libra\u00a0Sep 24 - Oct 23\u00a0Software engineers exist in a strange kind of temporal loop. They use the latest computers to create cutting-edge technology, but have to ensure their designs will work on all our ancient laptops. Having to merge innovation with continuity must be both interesting and frustrating. Although you\u2019re rightly excited about what the Eclipse brings your way, it\u2019s important it slots into the rest of your world. Just remember, change and consistency aren\u2019t always opposites. An exciting balance can be found.

You might be pondering whether you\u2019re right to feel so positive. Is this the calm before yet another storm? Is the relief you\u2019re experiencing inspired by what\u2019s passed, rather than what lies ahead? No. A sense of equilibrium is here to stay. You can stop looking back over your shoulder and giving thanks for what you\u2019ve managed to get through. And start looking ahead to what\u2019s to come. Welcome to May!\u00a0",
        "Your prediction for this action-packed month is ready. For inspiration, call 0906 751 5608.Sagittarius\u00a0Nov 23 - Dec 21\u00a0When fate comes knocking at our door, how do we know it\u2019s there? Does it knock, or casually stroll up and ring the doorbell? Do we hear harps being plucked, or the melodious voices of an angelic choir? Those who experience this kind of calling speak of a feeling deep in their souls that leads them towards people and opportunities. Are you resisting such a call? Yes, change is always scary.

Or . . . you could put the kettle on and make a nice cup of whatever takes your fancy. Some people take pleasure from creating the perfect coffee or tea. They research the temperature, the time to steep the leaves and the grind of the beans. It\u2019s great to be passionate, but don\u2019t let the relatively trivial steal your agenda \u2014 not when there\u2019s so much to accomplish.\u00a0",

Call 0906 751 5610.Aquarius\u00a0Jan 21 - Feb 19\u00a0Our opinions and routines share something important: they evolve without us noticing. Over time, flickers of thought evolve into deeply held beliefs. And things we do for the first time become fixtures, ending up ever more ingrained into our psyche.
