        "John Lewis staff can vote on Sharon White's leadership this week as questions over the retailer's future come to a head.",
        "Tomorrow and Wednesday, 60 employee representatives will have their say on White's role as chairman during a council meeting, including two votes on her leadership, according to reports from The Sunday Times.Although White cannot be ousted through this ballot, the council is able to dismiss her at any time if she fails to meet responsibilities.The council vote comes just weeks after it emerged that White could consider selling a stake in the business, undermining the 70-year-old partnership model, where 74,000 employees are part-owners.\u00a0The plan provoked a backlash, with ex-boss Andy Street saying the end of the partnership would be a 'tragedy'.Staff lost out on a bonus this year after the retail group posted a \u00a3230million full-year loss.\u00a0Chris Earnshaw, president of the Partnership Council, said: 'Since 1919, the chairman has held sessions with our Council to reflect on the performance. This is a routine part of our democratic process.'",
