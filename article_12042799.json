        "Audrey Barattiero, who was staying at Vallow's apartment in Rexburg, Idaho, in October 2019, wept as she recounted how she confronted her about whether there was 'anything weird going on'. Vallow told her, 'No.'At the time, Vallow's kids JJ, seven, and Tylee, 16, had vanished. Nine months later, they were found buried in her new husband's backyard. JJ's body was in trash bags.Barattiero told Vallow she was going to pack. 'As soon as I turned to go upstairs, she started laughing \u2013 as if at something hilarious,' Barattiero recalled. Vallow told her: 'You're so na\u00efve and too trusting. You're like a little child ... Well I've got news for you. Not everyone is a good person and not everyone can be so kind.'Barattiero told the court Vallow threatened to kill her: 'She said she would cut me up ... it would be so messy and there would be so much blood and something about bleach and trash bags. She would bury me in a place nobody would ever find me.'",
        "Vallow sat smiling - almost appearing to laugh at times - and whispered feverishly to her attorneys during Barattiero's emotional testimony at the Ada County Courthouse in Boise on Wednesday.The cult mom, 49, and her new husband Chad Daybell are accused of murdering her kids and then killing Daybell's wife Tammy a month later.\u00a0Two weeks after Tammy's death the pair married in Hawaii.",
        "Defense attorney Jim Archibald grilled\u00a0Barattiero over the 'crap' he accused her of making up after never disclosing it at grand jury proceedings. The witness testified that she had never spoken of it before because Vallow terrified her.'Nothing of this sort was talked about. You want the jury to believe that you just didn't make this last crap up?' Archibald said.Barattiero replied: 'I did not make it up.' She said she hadn't mentioned it before because Vallow said: 'If you ever tell anyone, I will find you in the dark of the night.'Earlier the witness told how Vallow had pledged to use 'knives and fire' to drive an evil spirit out of her husband at the time, Charles, just days before he was shot dead by Vallow's brother.Barattiero was attending a religious conference with the cult mom in Utah when she said she 'wanted to work on getting a negative spirit out of Charles.'Barattiero said Vallow claimed that her husband was a 'zombie' who had been possessed by an evil spirit. The alleged killer was leading a group of women in a prayer-like circle in her hotel room when she said she would use 'knives and fire and weapons' to 'work on her husband.'The conference was in June, 2019. On July 11 of that year, Charles Vallow was shot dead in Arizona by Vallow's brother Alex Cox who is also accused of being involved in the murder of her two kids.",
        "Vallow moved to Rexburg, Idaho, after Charles' death to be near her future husband Daybell. The State says the same theories about evil spirits and 'zombies' were used by Vallow and Daybell to justify the killings of her two kids and Daybell's wife Tammy.Barattiero said she met Daybell and Vallow in late 2018. At the time Vallow was married to Charles and Daybell was married to Tammy, but the pair are believed to have started an affair long before their eventual marriage.'I believed that there was kinda a vibe,' Barattierro told jurors. 'They didn't seem flirtatious but it seemed like they maybe liked each other or something.'",
        "She said that Daybell, who was a religious author and the self-styled leader of their deranged cult, later asked her to be friends with Vallow.Barattiero said Daybell told her 'he couldn't talk to her all the time'. She added: 'My impression was that he was trying to keep propriety because he was married.'She told the court that in January or February of 2019, Daybell told her his wife was going to be dead within a year.'He said that he had a near death experience and that a deceased relative told him that [Tammy] would pass on by the time she was 50,' Barattiero told jurors. Tammy Daybell died aged 49, seven months before her birthday.",
        "She said that in October 2019, the month of Tammy's death, Vallow had visited her in Missouri. She was over at Vallow's hotel when she told her that Tammy's spirit was in a cage and needed to be freed because 'some person has overtaken her body.'Vallow asked Barattierro to help with casting out the evil spirit from Tammy. Barattierro broke down as she told the court: 'I told her I did not want to help and did not want to participate. She highly pressured me saying you're supposed to be my friend, you're supposed to help me. I reiterated I didn't want to and she kept on.'Tammy died at the Daybells' home in Rexburg on October 19, 2019. She was initially determined to have died of natural causes but when cops started searching for Vallow's missing children her body was exhumed.An autopsy - which had been refused by Daybell - found she was suffocated.",
        "Vallow and Daybell tied the knot on a beach in Kauai on November 5, 2019. Receipts show she purchased her own wedding ring on Amazon almost three weeks before Tammy's death.\u00a0The children were missing for almost a year before their corpses were found buried in Daybell's yard on June 9, 2020.During the opening, prosecutor Lindsey Blake described how charred remains were all that was left of Tylee.",
        "She told jurors: 'You will hear it explained as a mass of bone and tissue. That's what was left of this beautiful young woman.'Tylee's DNA was later found on a pickaxe and shovel in a shed on the property. JJ's body was wrapped in trash bags and duct tape - the tape binding his arms in front of him and wrapping around his head.The two children and Daybell's previous wife Tammy were all killed because they stood in the way of the couple's relationship, the State says.\u00a0'Remember, the defendant will remove any obstacle in her way to get what she wants, and she wanted Chad Daybell,' Blake told jurors.",
        "'The defendant used money, power and sex to get what she wanted.'Jurors have heard from friends and relatives of Vallow that she and Daybell believed the children were 'dark' and referred to them as 'zombies' before they disappeared.'The common theme was the body has to be destroyed,' Blake said. 'The defendant and Chad used their self-proclaimed religious teachings to justify their actions to others \u2014 their actions from affair to murder.'Prosecutors say the couple planned to use life insurance money from Tammy's death, and that Vallow kept collecting and spending the children's social security and benefits after they died.",
        "The trial opened on April 10 and the State is still laying out its case.\u00a0Vallow denies two counts\u00a0of first-degree murder and three counts of conspiracy in the deaths of her two children and Tammy Daybell.She further denies grand theft for allegedly collecting government benefits on behalf of her children after they were killed.Daybell is being tried separately.",
