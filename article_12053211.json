        "Mum calls out hospital after daughter's death\u00a0\u00a0Girl took her life after being sent away from hospitalHealth Minister Yvette D'Ath said review is underwayA grieving mother has slammed a hospital after staff sent away her troubled daughter hours before the girl tragically took her own life.\u00a0",
        "Anne Le Pla said her daughter Courtney Grace Morison was released from Townsville University Hospital on two separate occasions last October after twice attempting to take her own life.\u00a0The hospital is now under a\u00a0'full clinical review' into the care given to the young woman.\u00a0Courtney had tried to take her life twice in the days leading up to her death - once on October 9 and again on October 10.\u00a0The teen, who suffered from depression, was sent to the hospital after the first attempt but was released the next day.\u00a0",
        "The mental health facility at the hospital then took her in later that night after she tried to take her life again - but the teenager was again released just hours later.\u00a0Courtney then died the next morning.\u00a0After one occasion of being dismissed by the hospital, Courtney posted on Facebook about how she wasn't being taken seriously.'How do you deal with being told it\u2019s behavioural all (the) time from the hospital \u2026' she wrote.'I\u2019m diagnosed with bipolar as well and haven't been doing well, everyone around can see something is clearly wrong but they won\u2019t help me cause (sic) it\u2019s behavioural apparently.'Mrs Le Pla said her 'cheeky and funny' daughter should never have been released in such a short space of time.\u00a0",
        "'If somebody goes in there twice in a row trying to take their own life, you would think that would mean something was wrong,' she told News Corp.'At the end of the day, what they told her was inexcusable.'Courtney was diagnosed with bipolar in 2018 but was on medication to help her cope with her mental health challenges.The teen, who her family described as having a bubbly personality despite her issues, would front up to mental health care facilities to get help.\u00a0She had also posted on social media after one visit to the hospital saying the staff 'won't help me' - and they had put her issues down to just a 'behavioural' problem.Her\u00a0sister Brittany Morison said Courtney told her the hospital workers would often dismiss her saying there was nothing wrong with her.\u00a0'Courtney has suffered with her mental health for many years and when she was living up in Townsville she would present herself to the hospital when she was struggling \u2013 something I was extremely proud of,' Ms Morison said.\u00a0But things started to go down hill after Courtney was sexually assaulted - with the incident under investigation.Mrs Le Pla said she wants answers and doesn't want any mother to go through the same 'painful' thing she has.",
        "Meanwhile, Townsville University Hospital chief executive Kieran Keyes told Daily Mail Australia the review into Courtney's care is under way.'Findings will determine if there are any learnings or actions resulting from this tragedy,' he said.\u00a0Mr Keyes said intensive mental health care is complex and is tailored to individual needs which can include being an inpatient or out in the community.\u00a0'Our health service is subject to privacy and confidentiality legislation and for this reason, I am unable to provide any further details about Ms Morison\u2019s care,' Mr Keyes added.'I would like to extend my deepest condolences to the family of Ms Morison.'\u00a0",
        "The family's story comes after a man was sent home from the same facility after he tried to harm himself.\u00a0Army veteran Steven Angus was released from the hospital on April 21 before being shot dead at his home by police just hours later.\u00a0Health Minister Yvette D\u2019Ath would not comment on individual cases but said a review into the teenager's care at the hospital was ongoing.\u00a0She said she recognises there is a lot of work to be done to improve mental health, alcohol and other drug services across the state.\u00a0Lifeline: 13 11 14 \uf0b7\u00a0Suicide call back service: 1300 659 467 \uf0b7\u00a0Beyond Blue: 1300 224 636 \uf0b7\u00a0",
