        "Size is everything for the middle-aged man with a massive telly, who measures his success in (diagonal) screen inchesREAD MORE: Dating trend sees women write off men whose names begin with J\u00a0Last month The Wall Street Journal reported that tech adoption among older adults (which, I\u2019m duty bound to tell you, means 50 plus) is soaring.\u00a0",
        "And where America leads, we tend to follow. Apparently, the prime motivator is getting fit, with \u2018health wearables\u2019 leading the charge.At least that\u2019s what these \u2018older adults\u2019 say when they\u2019re surveyed by earnest pollsters about their reasons for tech adoption, but I wonder if they\u2019re telling the truth.In my experience older men, at least, embrace gadgetry for a quite different reason \u2013 by which I mean a quest for control in familial home environments where they have little or no say on pretty much anything.\u00a0",
        "Even if it\u2019s only a habit of hogging the Sky box remote or zapping the Vauxhall\u2019s central locking with an Eastwood-esque gunslinging flourish, the latest tech offers a man a semblance of agency and wireless, fearless authority. His name on the high score.He\u2019s mostly bone idle and schoolboy excitable, too. A combination of default-setting indolence, a predilection for lazy convenience and box-fresh shininess appeals to both the attention-deficit monotasker in him and the Bond baddie lurking under his mouse mat.\u00a0Yes, world domination might\u00a0be a bit of a stretch when you work as an estate agent and get your clothes at River Island but controlling the parental lock on the sitting-room telly and running the triple-monitor, super-HD media output in the den is a step in the right direction.",
        "Recognise any of these tech types?1. THE NEARLY ADOPTERAlmost, very nearly, an early adopter \u2013 but not quite committed enough to be queuing overnight outside the Apple store for the new iPhone with all the other hoodie-and-backpack geeks.\u00a0Judicious, patient and cautious, the Nearly Adopter prefers to purchase version 2.0 of the latest tech, waits for the initial excitement to die down, the zig-zagging lines to recede and the technical glitches to be ironed out.\u00a0Where does he sit on the Venn diagram/food triangle of tech buyers, where the early adopter is at the top and the others \u2013 innovators, early majority, late majority, and laggards \u2013 lurk at the back?\u00a0He\u2019s the smug, risk-averse sort who waited for the iPad with a camera (the original version didn\u2019t have one) and bought the Apple watch only when it came preloaded with a built-in GPS for version 2. The Nearly Adopter is, let\u2019s be honest, a bit of a bore.2. THE EVERYTHINGERTech everything. Everywhere. All at once. This guy puts his trust and his toothbrush \u2013 and everything else electrical that he owns \u2013 in the capable hands of his wi-fi router.Going all-in on the conquering capability of the so-called Internet of Things, his doorbell, heating, robot vacuum cleaner, lawn mower, music system, roller blinds, induction hob, water flosser, smart kettle and washer/drier are connected to the internet and run off voice commands via his Alexa unit.\u00a0",
        "Which is all great (and very Blade Runner 2049/Ex Machina, super-modern) until the wi-fi router goes on the blink and the full-fibre, ultrafast 900 megabits provider goes Awol.\u00a0At this point the Everythinger is trapped inside his house, locked out of his car \u2013 a tricked-out, app-dependent Polestar 2 EV \u2013 and can\u2019t brush his teeth or get the toaster to work.\u00a0(NB: wives and girlfriends\u00a0of Everythingers should be aware that each time their partner issues a command to \u2018Alexa\u2019, he is secretly fantasising that the gorgeous Alexa Chung is listening somewhere out there in cyberspace and personally attending to his every need.)3. THE GARDEN GATESThis is the boffin, the fixer-upper, mender and innovator. He\u2019s the eccentric, semi-detached Steve Jobs, the Bill Gates of his own garden shed \u2013 a wooden-lean-to man cave full of wabi-sabi intent and Jay Blades intensity, but mostly bags of wires, chargers and connecting plugs, vintage amplifiers, obsolete printers, screens, desktop computers and defunct smart TV boxes.\u00a0This is the place where old tech goes, not to die, but to be revived and thrive again. Maybe. Garden Gates connects old-school hi-fi to his TV streamer and hooks up the sound to floor-standing stereo woofers the size of wardrobes.\u00a0He wires up an old Roberts radio so it becomes an Alexa-enabled smart speaker. Garden Gates rescues unwanted, outdated laptops from the council dump, scours the internet for obscure Chinese-made gizmos, TV boxes and strange leads and jacks. HDMI to Din cable anyone?",
        "VGA to USB? Mini phono to scart? Yes, Garden Gates is probably single.4. THE MAMWAMT\u00a0",
        "Size is everything for the middle-aged man with a massive telly, who measures his success in (diagonal) screen inches, and by the ever-growing battalion of remote-control devices next to his viewing chair. Which he operates with the dexterity of a concert pianist.\u00a0Speaking in fluent cinematic, widescreen lingo, and of jumbotron dimensions \u2013 high definition, surround sound, UHD Smart TV.He is at 90 inches right now, but he\u2019s heading for 100 before the year\u2019s out.Oh, he knows all the rules \u2013 measuring the distance from the viewing seat to where the telly will be (in inches) and halving it to find the optimum screen size \u2013 but he ignores them.\u00a0Just as you and I might ignore the indecipherable PIP PR+ or Q. View buttons on the remotes. Bigger and closer is always better for the Mamwamt. So his LG OLED (that\u2019s organic light-emitting diode \u2013 do try to keep up) Gallery Edition TV is two feet from his Charles and Ray Eames lounge chair, which is angled at a perfect 90 degrees.\u00a0The image on the screen fills his vision field. Talking heads are bigger than real heads. His eyes are bloodshot with pixel fatigue.\u00a0",
        "The sound is turned up to 11. The Mamwamt now has his eye on Samsung\u2019s enormous QN90A Neo QLED 4K HDR Smart TV \u2013 that\u2019s 98 inches of pleasure. At that kind of size, Homes Under the Hammer will look like a Spielberg production, he\u2019ll tell you.5. THE MAGA LOUT",
        "Nothing to do with Trump or making America great again \u2013 the Maga Lout is a slobby, middle-aged gaming addict whose social life is dominated by a thing for Grand Theft Auto, Call of Duty, Fortnite, The Last of Us, EA Sports FC\u2026\u00a0He prefers to view the world through Meta Quest-tinted specs, toggling between machine-gunning terrorists and fretting about carpal tunnel syndrome, tendonitis and synovitis -\u00a0gaming injuries all too rife in his ageing, itchy-joystick-finger demographic.\u00a0Rooted to his vibrating, surround-sound gaming chair with a butt-kicking bass woofer at the rear, home d\u00e9cor themes come down to a singular detail; blackout blinds.6. THE WFH BOYThe Covid-enforced lockdowns of 2020 and 2021 were golden times for the Working From Home Boy. Zoom calls are so much more fun and less stressful than IRL conversations.\u00a0With the pandemic now in the rear-view, and a general return to the office in motion, he\u2019s keeping the faith and still operating out of a room at his flat, his laptop resting on piles of old copies of GQ and Men\u2019s Health, Deliveroo on speed dial.\u00a0",
        "Now a pro Zoomer, he\u2019s downloaded a portfolio of amusing backgrounds \u2013 The Simpsons lounge and sofa, an immaculately curated Ikea study, the rock formation of El Capitan in Yosemite.\u00a0And in no way is he abusing his WFH privileges by drifting off during eight-handed conference calls, making a cup of tea, doing Wordle or napping on the sofa.But he has come up with this: film a clip of yourself, wearing a neutral but engaged expression, and making tiny movements with head and hands, as if listening attentively to someone speaking.\u00a0After a few minutes \u2013 long enough for any repetition to be too obvious \u2013 stop recording. Copy/paste the recording to a new folder. Now press go and let the super-focused clip of you play out on a continuous loop while you tend to the cafeti\u00e8re and the Netflix menu."
