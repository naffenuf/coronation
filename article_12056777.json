        "The Arab League has agreed to reinstate Syria, ending a 12-year suspension and taking another step towards bringing Syrian President Bashar Assad, a long-time regional pariah, back into the fold.",
        "Some influential league members remain opposed to reinstating Syria, chief among them Qatar, which did not send its foreign minister to Sunday\u2019s gathering in Egypt.Thirteen out of the league\u2019s 22 member states sent their foreign ministers to the meeting in Cairo.The decision represented a victory for Damascus, albeit a largely symbolic one.Given that Western sanctions against Assad\u2019s government remain in place, the return to the Arab League is not expected to lead to a quick release of reconstruction funds in the war-battered country. This doesn\u2019t mean that the Syria crisis has been resolved  Ahmed Aboul Gheit, Arab League secretary-general  Syria\u2019s membership in the Arab League was suspended early on during the 2011 uprising against Assad\u2019s rule that was met by a violent crackdown and quickly turned into a civil war.The conflict has killed nearly half a million people since March 2011 and displaced half of the country\u2019s pre-war population of 23 million.Arab League secretary-general Ahmed Aboul Gheit said in a televised statement that the decision to return Syria to the organisation, which will allow Assad to take part in the group\u2019s summit on May 19, is part of a gradual process of resolving the conflict.\u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean that the Syria crisis has been resolved, on the contrary,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it allows the Arab (states) for the first time in years to communicate with the Syrian government to discuss all the problems.\u201d",
        "Mr Aboul Gheit also said restoring Syria\u2019s membership in the organisation does not mean all Arab countries have normalised ties with Damascus.\u201cThese are sovereign decisions for each state individually,\u201d he said.Syrian Prime Minister Hussein Arnous claimed on Sunday that Syria had been the victim of \u201cmisinformation and distortion campaigns launched by our enemies\u201d for 12 years. He said Sunday\u2019s consultations reflected the \u201cprestigious position\u201d Syria holds regionally and internationally.Opponents of Assad saw the move towards normalisation as a betrayal.\u201cArab states have put their own cynical realpolitik and diplomatic agendas above basic humanity,\u201d said Laila Kiki, executive director of The Syria Campaign, an international advocacy group.The move, she said, has \u201ccruelly betrayed tens of thousands of victims of the regime\u2019s war crimes and granted Assad a green light to continue committing horrific crimes with impunity.\u201dSunday\u2019s decision came days after regional top diplomats met in Jordan to discuss a road map to return Syria to the Arab fold as the conflict continues to de-escalate.The Arab League generally tries to reach agreements by consensus but sometimes opts for simple majorities. Sunday\u2019s session was held behind closed doors, and it was not immediately clear which countries had registered objections.The decision also includes a commitment by Arab governments to try to reach a political solution to the conflict, in line with UN Security Council Resolution 2254. Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq were asked by the league to follow up on developments.",
        "The league welcomed what it said was the Syrian government\u2019s willingness to co-operate with Arab countries to resolve \u201chumanitarian, security, and political\u201d crises that affected Syria and the region due to the conflict, including refugees, \u201cthe threat of terrorism and drug smuggling\u201d.Many observers had anticipated Syria\u2019s imminent return to the organisation.Arab rapprochement with Damascus accelerated after a deadly earthquake on February 6 that shattered parts of the war-torn country. One of the countries pushing for normalisation of ties is Saudi Arabia, which once backed opposition groups trying to overthrow Assad.Egyptian foreign minister Samer Shoukry said before Sunday\u2019s meeting that only an Arab-led \u201cpolitical solution without foreign dictates\u201d can end the ongoing conflict.\u201cThe different stages of the Syrian crisis proved that it has no military solution, and that there is no victor nor defeated in this conflict,\u201d he said.In recent years, as Assad regained control of most of the country with the help of key allies Russia and Iran, neighbours of Syria that hosted large refugee populations took steps towards reopening diplomatic links with Damascus. Meanwhile, two Gulf monarchies, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, re-established ties.The earthquake that rocked Turkey and Syria was a catalyst for further normalisation across the Arab world. China helped to broker a recent rapprochement between arch-rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran, which had backed opposing sides in the Syrian conflict.",
        "Jordan last week hosted regional talks that included envoys from Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Egypt and Syria. They agreed on a framework, dubbed the \u201cJordanian initiative\u201d, that would slowly bring Damascus back into the Arab fold.Amman\u2019s top diplomat said the meeting was the \u201cbeginning of an Arab-led political path\u201d for a solution to the crisis.The conflict in Sudan is also on the agenda, as Arab states try to stabilise a shaky ceasefire in the ongoing fighting that has killed hundreds of people over the past few weeks."
