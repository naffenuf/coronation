        "Many disabled people are facing a cost-of-breathing crisis amid higher energy bills, a new television advert has warned.",
        "Disabled people who rely on energy to move around, speak and breathe risk losing their independence, health and wellbeing, a charity said as it revealed a quarter of the callers to its helpline who rely on medical equipment have had to switch it off to save money.Scope, a disability equality charity, said that while much of the population is looking forward to using less energy as the weather warms up in the summer, many disabled people will not have that option. As the spiralling cost of living forces many people to cut down their energy use, for disabled people, it can be life and death  Toby Greaves, Scope  The charity\u2019s advice lines have supported almost 38,000 disabled people over the past year and more than a third (38%) of callers to its energy helpline are in energy debt \u2013 on average by more than \u00a31,000.Scope said two in five calls to its helpline have medical equipment and that almost a quarter of these people (23%) have had to switch medical equipment off to cut costs.In research published last month, the charity said that, on average, disabled households need an additional \u00a3975 a month to have the same standard of living as non-disabled households.",
        "The new advertising campaign will air on ITV throughout May and June to highlight how disabled people are being affected by the cost-of-living crisis.",
