But the hard work in Sudan has not finished.\u201dThe Foreign Secretary earlier said there was still a British military presence at the country\u2019s main seaport on the Red Sea coast with the HMS Lancaster warship off the coast.",
        "A renewed 72-hour ceasefire was due to end at midnight on Wednesday in Sudan with the Foreign Office warning \u201cviolence could escalate\u201d.It said: \u201cWe are closely monitoring the situation in Khartoum and other parts of Sudan where there are ongoing military clashes.\u201cThere is now fighting in various locations across Sudan. Khartoum International Airport is currently closed.\u201dMartin Griffiths, the United Nations under secretary general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief co-ordinator, arrived in Port Sudan on Wednesday to seek guarantees for the safe passage of aid deliveries.He said: \u201cIt\u2019s not as if we\u2019re asking for the moon. We\u2019re asking for the movement of humanitarian supplies and people. We do this in every other country, even without ceasefires.\u201dSpeaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, he said it was \u201cunfair\u201d to suggest that the UN did not see the conflict coming, or was slow to respond.\u201cThere are a lot of people didn\u2019t see it coming. A lot of people in Sudan who didn\u2019t see it coming.\u201cMaybe we were derelict in our duty. Maybe we were derelict in our responsibility. Fine, that\u2019s yesterday. What we\u2019re talking about today is doing something that is consistent with our values.\u201dThe United Nations said Sudanese army chief General Abdel Fattah Burhan and his rival General Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, the head of a paramilitary group known as the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), have agreed to send representatives to the negotiation table in a bid to establish a more stable truce.",
        "Generals Burhan and Dagalo, both with powerful foreign backers, were allies in an October 2021 military coup that halted Sudan\u2019s fraught transition to democracy, but they have since turned on each other."
