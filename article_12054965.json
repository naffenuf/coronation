        "Noel and Sara have strongly denied this claim, with the star releasing a statement in 2001 which shared that he didn't cheat and 'left Meg because I could no longer tolerate her behaviour'.Noel and Sara tied the knot in 2011 at the Lime Wood Hotel in the New Forest in a \u00a360,000 ceremony, with guests including Russell Brand watching on - but Liam said he wasn't invited.'He goes on about how he wasn't invited to my wedding. No one was at my wedding but Nic's [wife Nicole Appleton] mum and my mum. Get over it, mate. I've not been invited to his wedding,' Liam told the Chicago Sun-Times.Liam famously doesn't get along with Sara and has had a slew of public rows with the PR exec in the past.He even hinted that she was the reason that an Oasis reunion wouldn't be happening, with Noel furious over Liam's name-calling about Sara.Back in 2020, a fan tweeted him, asking: 'Hi Liam, do you know why Noel hates Oasis reunion so much??????'While he responded suggesting that it was her fault, penning: 'I've told you before he's rite up for it but you know who won't let him as she doesn't like oasis music [sic].The brothers themselves have had little contact in the last ten years after Noel publicly quit the band in 2009.",
        "But fans are now wondering if there may be hope in the future for the band to get back together again."
