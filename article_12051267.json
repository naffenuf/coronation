        "Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp admits even extending their five-match winning run is unlikely to affect the top-four sides they are chasing and he expects to miss out on Champions League football next season.",
        "Wednesday\u2019s victory over Fulham, combined with Manchester United\u2019s late defeat to Brighton, meant the gap to fourth place in the Premier League is four points.However, United have a match in hand, from which they could overtake Newcastle two points ahead, while Liverpool also face pressure from below with Brighton four points behind with two games in hand.\u201cOther teams are in much better positions. As long as they win games, we have no chance and we have to keep teams behind us, which (for) not all of them we can do that,\u201d said Klopp\u201cWe have 59 (points), United has 63 so we can get 71 maximum. United needs for that eight points in five, (eight points) from 15. I think they will do that.\u201cThey win three games of the rest and that is it for us.\u201dWhile their current run is the best for more than a year, the cracks are starting to appear in the squad again.Midfielder Thiago Alcantara is having surgery on a troublesome hip injury in order to ensure he is fit for pre-season, while captain Jordan Henderson could miss Saturday\u2019s visit of Brentford.",
        "Thiago was absent for two months with his problem and although he made a brief comeback in April, he has missed the last two matches and the club have decided it is best for him to get it sorted now.",
        "\u201cThiago will have surgery and is out for the rest of the season. It\u2019s the same issue he was recently out for a couple of months with,\u201d said Klopp.Asked whether he would be ready for pre-season, the manager added: \u201cYeah. That is why we do it now.\u201dLiverpool are awaiting the results of a scan on Henderson but he could miss the visit of Brentford with the minor problem.\u201cHendo I have to see; a scan yesterday will not be a big thing but maybe enough to rule him out tomorrow.\u201dLiverpool have confirmed they will play the national anthem ahead of Saturday\u2019s evening kick-off despite expected opposition from home fans.Supporters have regularly booed the anthem, such as before cup finals, in defiance at their long-standing resentment against the establishment due to the city\u2019s political background and, more recently, in relation to the handling of the Hillsborough disaster and the fight for justice.Liverpool feel they have been put in an impossible position by the Premier League\u2019s suggestion the anthem is played and although have they taken the \u201ctough\u201d decision to play the anthem, they believe in safe freedom of expression and are aware the response may not be favourable.During Wednesday\u2019s win over Fulham the Kop sang \u201cYou can stick your coronation up your a***\u201d.",
        "\u201cThe club\u2019s position is my position. That is clear. Besides that, this is definitely a subject which I cannot really have a proper opinion about,\u201d said Klopp.",
        "\u201cI am from Germany, we don\u2019t have a king or a queen, I am 55 years old and I have no experience of that.\u201cWatching from the outside, it is a nice thing to watch when all the weddings are massive things in Germany but no one really knows what it is like. It is like watching a movie. We don\u2019t feel that.\u201cI am pretty sure a lot of people in this country will enjoy the coronation. Some will not be interested and some will not like it. That is it and that is over the whole country.\u201d"
