        "'Neither of them want any secrets, or to hide away. The plan is for Matty to walk out on stage mid-show and play two songs.'They will chat to the audience and, at present, the idea is for them to confirm their romance with some kind of PDA \u2014 public display of affection. It won't be anything remotely cheesy though.'MailOnline contacted representatives of Taylor and Matty for comment at the time.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",
        "It comes as Matty\u00a0reportedly split from model Meredith Mickelson just weeks before he started dating Taylor.The singer was said to have been romancing the model, 23, who has built up a large following on social media, before they parted ways in Febuary.A source told The Sun:\u00a0'Matty was seeing Meredith while he was in LA in February - but things fizzled out when he went to New York at the end of the month,' says an insider.'They're still on good terms but haven't been romantically involved since then.'Meredith boasts over 3million followers on Instagram and is said to be based primarily between Los Angeles and Paris.",
        "MailOnline has contacted representatives of Meredith Mickelson for comment.\u00a0It comes after Matty and Taylor's reported new romance was revealed on Wednesday- just weeks after her split from\u00a0actor\u00a0Joe Alwyn.\u00a0The singer is said to be 'madly in love' with Matty after their long-term friendship blossomed into romance.\u00a0",
        "The duo - who first met in 2014 - are now gearing up to go public with their romance during her\u00a0concert in Nashville, Tennessee on Friday, reports\u00a0The Sun.News of the new romance comes just weeks after it emerged that Taylor split from her boyfriend of six years Joe, 32, after\u00a0the pair 'struggled' with their 'career differences'.\u00a0Yet despite the short turnaround, Taylor is said to be 'madly in love' with Matt - who is the son of Loose Women star Denise Welch and Benidorm actor,\u00a0Tim Healy.\u00a0The rumoured romance with Matt is the latest in a string of British boyfriends for Taylor, who - as well as her last relationship with Joe - has dated Harry Styles, Calvin Harris, and Tom Hiddleston.\u00a0An insider told the publication: 'She and Matty are madly in love.\u00a0",
        "'It's super-early days, but it feels right. They first dated, very briefly, almost ten years ago but timings just didn't work out.'The source went on to insist that there was no crossover in Taylor's love life, despite news of her split from Joe emerging last month, insisting that the pair actually broke up in February.\u00a0Taylor is currently in the middle of the US leg of her The Eras Tour while The 1975 are on their At Their Very Best concert tour, but the source insisted they have kept in constant communication by texting and Face Timing.",
        "The source added:\u00a0'As two international megastars, they understand the pressures of one another's jobs better than anyone, and are incredibly supportive of their respective careers.'They are both massively proud and excited about this relationship and, unlike Taylor's last one \u2014 which was very much kept out of the spotlight, deliberately \u2014 she wants to 'own' this romance, and not hide it away.'Taylor just wants to live her life, and be happy. She's told pals Matty is flying to Nashville over the weekend to support her on the next leg of her tour.'DailyMail.com contacted representatives for Taylor for comment.Back in 2015, Matt denied romance rumours with Taylor\u00a0but confirmed they had been texting each other frequently.\u00a0",
        "After rumours began circling he confirmed on Australian radio:\u00a0'It's fake. It's all bloody fake. It's a farce!'Yeah, we met each other, we exchanged numbers in the same way that a lot of people in this kind of world do and we spoke occasionally.'And she's the biggest pop star in the world and I'm in Australia. There's no like, relationship or anything happening. It's just funny how people really, really buy into that.'\u00a0"
