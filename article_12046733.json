        "Here is all the coronation regalia being used at the crowning of the King and Queen Consort.",
        "The sacred, priceless objects are part of the Crown Jewels \u2013 the nation\u2019s most precious treasures \u2013 which are held in trust by the King for the country and kept under armed guard in the Tower of London.\u2013 PROCESSION\u2013 Two ceremonial macesMaces \u2013 based on medieval weapons \u2013 are used in royal processions to symbolise royal authority and will be carried before the sovereign on his way to Westminster Abbey.",
        "They are club-like, topped with crown arches and made of silver gilt over oak.They date between 1660 and 1695, and are also used at the State Opening of Parliament.\u2013 St Edward\u2019s StaffSt Edward\u2019s Staff, also known as the Long Sceptre, has a pike of steel at the bottom and is carried as part of the procession into the abbey.Most of the original ancient coronation regalia was destroyed by Oliver Cromwell during the English Civil War and remade during the reign of Charles II, including the staff which was a relic associated with Edward the Confessor.",
        "\u2013 Swords of Temporal Justice, Spiritual Justice and MercyThe practice of carrying three swords, representing kingly virtues, dates back to the coronation of Richard the Lionheart in 1189.",
        "The Sword of Temporal Justice signifies the monarch\u2019s role as Head of the Armed Forces, the Sword of Spiritual Justice symbolises the King as Defender of the Faith, and the Sword of Mercy, also known as the Curtana, has a blunted tip to symbolise the sovereign\u2019s mercy.",
        "They are carried pointing upwards, unsheathed without their scabbards, in the coronation procession in the abbey.Together with the Coronation Spoon, the three swords \u2013 which date from the reign of Charles I \u2013 were the only pieces of the coronation regalia to survive the Civil War.\u2013 Sword of StateThe 17th-century Sword of State is carried in procession to the abbey.",
        "Its silver-gilt hilt features the form of a lion and unicorn and the wooden scabbard is covered in red velvet with silver-gilt rose, thistle and fleur-de-lis emblems.It is also carried during the State Opening of Parliament.\u2013 THE ANOINTING\u2013 AmpullaThe anointing of the King with holy oil is the most sacred part of the ceremony.The gold Ampulla is shaped in the form of an eagle with outspread wings and is used to hold the consecrated oil.",
        "There is an opening in the beak for pouring the oil on to the Coronation Spoon.It is based on an earlier smaller vessel which took inspiration from a 14th-century legend saying the Virgin Mary appeared to St Thomas Becket in a dream and presented him with a golden eagle and a vial of oil for anointing future kings of England.\u2013 Coronation SpoonThe 12th-century spoon is considered the \u201cmost humble\u201d but the oldest object in the Crown Jewels.",
        "The blessed oil is poured into the bowl or head of the spoon to allow the Archbishop to dip his fingers into it.",
        "He will privately anoint the King, hidden by a screen, with the sign of the cross on his hand, his breast and his head, and then later anoint Camilla.The King will have taken off his crimson Robe of State and be dressed in a simple white shirt for the anointing.The Coronation Spoon survived Parliament\u2019s destruction of the Crown Jewels in 1649 because it was bought by a royal servant in a sale of the executed Charles I\u2019s goods and later returned to Charles II.Made of silver gilt, it has an oval bowl which is engraved with acanthus scrolls and divided into two lobes \u2013 allowing enough space for two fingers to be used for dipping.Its stem features two stylised monsters\u2019 heads, pearls and interlaced scrolling.\u2013 Colobium Sindonis, Supertunica and Coronation GirdleAfter his anointing, the King will put on a sleeveless white garment called the Colobium Sindonis \u2013 Latin for shroud tunic.On top will go a long shimmering gold-sleeved coat called the Supertunica, created for his great-grandfather George V in 1911, and worn at successive coronations including by Elizabeth II.",
        "Made of cloth of gold, which is silk thread wrapped in thin pieces of gold or silver gilt metal, the Supertunica, also known as the Close Pall of Cloth of Gold, weighs around 2kg and is embroidered with stylised arabesques and floral motifs.",
        "Around his waist, on top of the Supertunica, goes the Coronation Sword Belt also known as the Coronation Girdle, which is embroidered cloth of gold with a gold buckle stamped with national emblems.",
        "It has a gold clip used for briefly attaching the Jewelled Sword of Offering.The glittering coronation vestments are inspired by priestly attire.\u2013 THE INVESTITUREThe investiture part of the coronation is when the King is given all the symbolic objects representing his powers and responsibilities.It stems from medieval times when coronation ceremonies were in Latin, with the symbols ensuring those in the audience who could not speak Latin could interpret their meaning.\u2013 Golden SpursEach of the gold spurs features a Tudor rose and velvet-covered strap with gold embroidery.",
        "Traditionally, the spurs were fastened to the sovereign\u2019s feet during a coronation and in later times held briefly to the ankles of kings or presented to a queen for her to touch, and then placed on the altar.The King will instead acknowledge the spurs, presented by the Lord Great Chamberlain, before they are returned to the altar.They were made for Charles II and symbolise knighthood and chivalry.\u2013 Jewelled Sword of OfferingThe intricate tapered sword, made for George IV\u2019s 1821 coronation, has a hilt encrusted with diamonds, rubies and emeralds and a scabbard decorated with jewelled roses, thistles and shamrocks.",
        "Lord President of the Council Penny Mordaunt will present it to the monarch, becoming the first woman in history to do so.",
        "It will be briefly clipped to the King\u2019s coronation sword belt and then after a proclamation by the Archbishop, the King will step forward and offer up the sword.It will be placed on the altar, and redeemed with \u201credemption money\u201d by Ms Mordaunt.The sword is then drawn and she carries it in its \u201cnaked\u201d form \u2013 without its scabbard \u2013 before the monarch for the rest of the service.It symbolises royal power and being able to decide between good and evil, and the monarch accepting his duty and knightly virtues.\u2013 ArmillsGolden armlets \u2013 known as Armills \u2013 used to be placed on the sovereign\u2019s wrists, but the King will acknowledge them instead.They will be carried to the monarch by Lord Kamall, a British-born Muslim, before being returned to the altar.They are known as the \u201cbracelets of sincerity and wisdom\u201d and are thought to relate to ancient symbols of knighthood and military leadership.New Armills were prepared for the coronation of Elizabeth II as a gift from the Commonwealth, replacing the previous pair, which had been used since 1661.But the King will use the original pair last used by his grandfather, George VI.",
        "They are decorated with national emblems \u2013 roses, thistles, fleurs-de-lis and harps \u2013 dark blue fleurets and red pellets, and lined in red velvet.\u2013 The Robe Royal and Stole RoyalThe King will be given a Stole Royal \u2013 also known as the Coronation Stole \u2013 which is a long, narrow embroidered band of gold silk which goes around the shoulders, mirroring outfits worn by a priest or a bishop.The King will next be dressed in the Imperial Mantle \u2013 or Robe Royal \u2013 made for his extravagant ancestor George IV in 1821.",
        "Made from cloth of gold, it is brocaded with colourful motifs including fleur-de-lis as a nod to the ancient claim of England over France, as well as imperial eagles, and national floral emblems of red-pink roses, blue thistles and green shamrocks.The mantle is inspired by ancient coronation ensembles and its representation of priestly robes symbolises the divine nature of kingship.Heir to the throne the Prince of Wales enters the coronation theatre to assist with placing the robe on his father, as does Baroness Gillian Merron, who served as the Board of Deputies of British Jews\u2019 chief executive for more than six years.\u2013 Sovereign\u2019s OrbThe Sovereign\u2019s Orb, with its cross mounted on a golden globe, symbolises that the monarch\u2019s power is derived from God.",
        "It is decorated with clusters of emeralds, rubies and sapphires surrounded by rose-cut diamonds, and single rows of pearls, with the bands of jewels dividing it into three sections representing the three continents known in medieval times.During the coronation service, the Orb \u2013 which weighs 1.3kg and dates back to 1661 \u2013 is placed in the monarch\u2019s right hand by the Anglican Archbishop of Armagh.It is then put on the altar before the moment of crowning.\u2013 Sovereign\u2019s RingKnown as the \u201cWedding Ring of England\u201d, the Sovereign\u2019s Ring \u2013 also called the Coronation Ring \u2013 is a symbol of \u201ckingly dignity\u201d and it marries the King to God in duty.It used to be placed on the fourth finger of the monarch\u2019s right hand, but the King will instead acknowledge it before it is returned to the altar.It will be presented by Lord Patel.A new ring used to be made for each king or queen, but for nearly 200 years monarchs have used William IV\u2019s 1831 ring \u2013 except for Queen Victoria whose fingers were too small so she had a new one made.William IV\u2019s ring features a large sapphire and diamond cluster with baguette-cut rubies in the form of a cross.The rubies represent the cross of the patron saint of England St George and the sapphire is said to represent the Scottish flag.\u2013 Coronation GloveThe single Coronation Glove \u2013 also known as the Coronation Gauntlet \u2013 goes on the King\u2019s right hand while he holds the Sovereign\u2019s Sceptre with Cross during the crowning.",
        "It is made of white leather, and the large cuff is embroidered with gilt metal thread, wire and spangles in the form of national emblems including the Tudor rose, thistle, shamrock, oak leaves and acorns.The back of the hand has an embroidered ducal coronet above the coat of arms of the family of the Dukes of Newcastle.Charles, for reasons of sustainability and efficiency, has decided to reuse the glove worn by his grandfather \u2013 the last male monarch \u2013 George VI.Prominent Sikh broadcaster Lord Singh of Wimbledon presents the King with the glove.\u2013 Sovereign\u2019s Sceptre with CrossThe Sovereign\u2019s Sceptre with Cross has been used at every coronation since Charles II\u2019s in 1661.",
        "It is the symbol of royal earthly power and is placed in the monarch\u2019s right hand for the crowning.The sceptre was transformed in 1910 for George V with the addition of the spectacular Cullinan I diamond \u2013 530.2 carats and the largest colourless cut diamond in the world.\u2013 Sovereign\u2019s Sceptre with DoveThis sceptre is symbolic of justice and mercy and is placed in the monarch\u2019s left hand for the crowning.",
        "It represents the sovereign\u2019s spiritual role, with the dove symbolising the Holy Ghost, and traditionally has also been called the Rod of Equity and Mercy.Made from gold, it is decorated with enamelled and gem-set collars at three intersections, surmounted by a gold monde, with an applied silver zone and arc set with rose diamonds, and a gold cross supporting an enamelled dove with outspread wings.The rod and the sceptre are put in the King\u2019s hands by the Archbishop.\u2013 St Edward\u2019s Crown \u2013 The Coronation CrownThe St Edward\u2019s Crown is used at the moment of coronation.Weighing 2.23kg (nearly 5lb), it is the heaviest crown in the Crown Jewels.In 1953, the then-archbishop of Canterbury Dr Geoffrey Fisher raised it aloft and placed it on Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s head.",
        "\u201cBy a glance she indicated it was steady,\u201d he later recalled.It has a solid gold frame and is set with tourmalines, white and yellow topazes, rubies, amethysts, sapphires, garnet, peridot, zircons, spinel and aquamarines, step-cut and rose-cut and mounted in enamelled gold collets, and has a purple velvet cap with an ermine band.The crown was made for the coronation of Charles II in 1661 and was a replacement for the medieval crown, which was melted down on the orders of Oliver Cromwell in 1649 after the execution of Charles I.The original was thought to date back to the 11th-century royal saint, Edward the Confessor, the last Anglo-Saxon king of England.",
        "Although it is not an exact replica of the medieval design, it follows the original in having four crosses pattee, four fleurs-de-lis and two arches.It is St Edward\u2019s Crown that appears in the royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom, the Royal Mail logo and in badges of the armed forces.Under a top secret operation, the crown was briefly removed from the Tower of London to be resized to fit the King\u2019s head.\u2013 THE QUEEN CONSORT\u2019S REGALIA\u2013 The Queen Consort\u2019s RingThe ruby ring was made for the coronation of King William IV for his consort Queen Adelaide in 1831.For previous Queens Consort, it was put on the fourth finger of their right hand, but Camilla will instead acknowledge it and it will be returned to the altar.",
        "The ring is presented by The Keeper of The Jewel House.It has been used by three further Queens Consort; Queen Alexandra, Queen Mary, and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.Made of extended octagonal mixed-cut ruby, it has a gold setting, unbacked, within a border of 14 cushion-shaped brilliant diamonds.\u2013 Queen Mary\u2019s CrownCamilla has chosen to be crowned in the crown made for Charles\u2019s great-grandmother Queen Mary for George V\u2019s coronation in 1911.",
        "It is the first time a consort\u2019s crown has been recycled for a coronation rather than a new one created and could potentially be renamed Queen Camilla\u2019s Crown in the future.It used to feature the controversial Koh-i-noor diamond but this will not be used and the crown is being altered to include the Cullinan III, IV and V diamonds \u2013 from Elizabeth II\u2019s personal jewellery collection.Four of its eight detachable arches are being removed to create a different look at Camilla\u2019s request.\u2013 The Queen Consort\u2019s Sceptre with CrossCamilla will acknowledge and briefly touch the gold rod after being crowned, rather than holding it in her right hand as is tradition.It is surmounted by a monde with a zone and arc of moulded gold set with table-cut quartzes, with a cross above mounted with rose-cut and shaped quartzes.",
        "It represents temporal power and was originally made for the coronation of Mary of Modena, Queen Consort of James II, in 1685.The Sceptre is presented by Lord Chartres.\u2013 The Queen Consort\u2019s Rod with DoveThe controversial rod is made of ivory and rather than hold it in her left hand after being crowned, Camilla will acknowledge it.Buckingham Palace said Camilla will only touch the rod and sceptre rather than holding them as is tradition.The rod symbolises equity and mercy and the dove, with its folded wings, represents the Holy Ghost. It was also made for Mary of Modena.The Prince of Wales has long campaigned against the trade in ivory.The Rod is presented by the Bishop of Dover.\u2013 THE FINAL CROWN\u2013 Imperial State CrownThe King will switch from the St Edward\u2019s Crown into the lighter Imperial Crown before he processes out of the abbey at the end of the service.It will be the first time he has worn the famous symbol of the monarchy \u2013 which is used at State Openings of Parliament \u2013 in public.",
        "It is known as a working crown and was also removed from the Tower of London to be resized for Charles.It was originally made for the coronation of his grandfather George VI in 1937 and contains 2,868 diamonds, 17 sapphires, 11 emeralds, four rubies and 269 pearls and weighs over a kilogram.Among its jewels is the Black Prince\u2019s Ruby \u2013 one of the late Queen\u2019s favourite gems \u2013 as well as the Cullinan II diamond and a large oval sapphire known as the Stuart Sapphire."
