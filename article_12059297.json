        "MADRID/BANGKOK, May 8 (Reuters) - Spanish stock market regulator CNMV on Monday suspended the trading of shares in NH Hotel Group SA pending information from the company, just as its Thailand-based parent company offered to buy NH stocks in the market.",
        "The regulator said the suspension was a \"precautionary measure\" taken \"while relevant information on the aforementioned entity is disseminated\".Minor International, which already owns a 94% stake in NH, said in a separate statement issued after the CNMV's announcement it would buy outstanding shares on the Madrid stock exchange for a 30-day period at a price no higher than 4.50 euros ($4.97) per share.Earlier on Monday, NH published its first-quarter results but did not mention Minor's offer. The group's net recurring loss halved to 40 million euros from a year ago as it expected demand to remain strong in coming months.The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Its shares rose about 1% to 3.625 euros on Friday. ($1 = 0.9051 euros) (Reporting by David Latona and Corina Pons in Madrid and Chayut Setboonsarng in Bangkok; Editing by Andrei Khalip)"
