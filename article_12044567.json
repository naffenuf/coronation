        "Known for his tough-talking style of journalism, the 59-year-old was so popular with viewers, at one stage he was tipped to host ACA after Tracy Grimshaw retired from the show in November.Hall's recent stories include reports on NDIS rorts, the crisis in Australia's aged care centres and struggling bush fire victims.Halls was notorious for chasing down scammers, including dodgy tradies and con artists.In a statement ACA's executive producer Fiona Dear said of Halls' retirement plans: 'We all knew this day was coming soon but it\u2019s still hard to believe Brady Halls won\u2019t be on A Current Affair.\u00a0",
        "'We\u2019ve enjoyed decades of Brady entertaining families and fighting for Aussies who had lost hope. Now it\u2019s time we let Brady spend some time with his own family.'Brady Halls is a \u2018'one of a kind'' journalist. He will be sorely missed.'",
        "During his time at A Current Affair, Halls has worked with the show's top anchors, including Ray Martin, Mike Munro, Grimshaw and most recently Allison Langdon.Halls was previously a reporter for the network's lunch-time variety program, The Midday Show, which ran from 1985-1998.It was during his time on that show Halls stunned viewers when he proposed to his long-time girlfriend and co-worker Debbie live on air.The couple, who have now been married for 25 years, share two children."
