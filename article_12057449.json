        "The former head of the British Army has said he is \u201cuncomfortable\u201d with the Government\u2019s plans to send migrants who enter the UK unlawfully to Rwanda.",
        "General Lord Richard Dannatt pointed to the \u201cdark history\u201d of the east African nation which he said is still cast in the \u201cshadow of the genocide\u201d.He accused the Home Secretary of running \u201cdown the remaining political capital of Rishi Sunak\u2019s Government\u201d with the \u201cunpopular policy\u201d. It\u2019s not the sort of environment I would put people from Syria and elsewhere in the world into  Lord Dannatt  \u201cThe Government is entitled to bear down on people coming on small boats who are simply seeking a better life,\u201d the crossbench peer told The Independent.\u201cWhether sending people to Rwanda is the right policy, I have my doubts. It seems to be aimed at deterring others from coming, because there is a strong sanction against them. I\u2019m uncomfortable with it.\u201cI\u2019ve been to Rwanda, and the shadow of the genocide there in the 1990s hangs over that country.\u201d",
        "He told the online paper it is \u201cruled with a very firm hand\u201d by Rwandan president Paul Kagame.\u201cIt\u2019s got a pretty dark history, and it\u2019s not the sort of environment I would put people from Syria and elsewhere in the world into.\u201dThe UK has agreed a multimillion-pound partnership with Rwanda designed to tackle the number of migrants coming to Britain via unauthorised routes.",
        "The \u00a3140 million deal will see some migrants who arrive on small boats via the English Channel sent to Rwanda, if they cannot be deported back to their home country.The plan has so far been stalled by legal action and no flights have taken off.Lord Dannatt said: \u201cIt\u2019s somewhat surprising Suella Braverman is persisting with an unpopular policy\u2026 I fail to understand why the Home Secretary is continuing to run down the remaining political capital of Rishi Sunak\u2019s Government.\u201d"
