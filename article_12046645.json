        "Taylor Swift secretly reunited with rumoured new boyfriend Matty Healy more than two years ago - in a music sense.\u00a0",
        "Matty, who is the lead singer of The 1975, wrote songs with Taylor and his band for her latest album Midnights.Although the songs were set to feature in the album, they were never actually released, as Matty revealed in November 2022.\u00a0Speaking on Kroq's DTS Sound Space, he said: 'Yeah. We actually worked a bit on that. But then [that] version of it never came out.'There were boos from the audience but he said: 'No, no, no \u2013 that's not how it works. It [didn't work out] for reasons that are not to be criticised. She's amazing.'",
        "He also shared that Taylor had listened to The 1975's record Being Funny In A Foreign Language before it came out.\u00a0It comes after Matty and Taylor's reported new romance was revealed on Wednesday- just weeks after her split from\u00a0actor\u00a0Joe Alwyn.\u00a0The singer is said to be 'madly in love' with Matty after their long-term friendship blossomed into romance.\u00a0The duo - who first met in 2014 - are now gearing up to go public with their romance during her\u00a0concert in Nashville, Tennessee on Friday, reports\u00a0The Sun.News of the new romance comes just weeks after it emerged that Taylor split from her boyfriend of six years Joe, 32, after\u00a0the pair 'struggled' with their 'career differences'.\u00a0",
        "Yet despite the short turnaround, Taylor is said to be 'madly in love' with Matt - who is the son of Loose Women star Denise Welch and Benidorm actor,\u00a0Tim Healy.\u00a0The rumoured romance with Matt is the latest in a string of British boyfriends for Taylor, who - as well as her last relationship with Joe - has dated Harry Styles, Calvin Harris, and Tom Hiddleston.\u00a0An insider told the publication: 'She and Matty are madly in love.\u00a0'It's super-early days, but it feels right. They first dated, very briefly, almost ten years ago but timings just didn\u2019t work out.'",
        "The source went on to insist that there was no crossover in Taylor's love life, despite news of her split from Joe emerging last month, insisting that the pair actually broke up in February.\u00a0Taylor is currently in the middle of the US leg of her The Eras Tour while The 1975 are on their At Their Very Best concert tour, but the source insisted they have kept in constant communication by texting and Face Timing.The source added:\u00a0'As two international megastars, they understand the pressures of one another\u2019s jobs better than anyone, and are incredibly supportive of their respective careers.'They are both massively proud and excited about this relationship and, unlike Taylor\u2019s last one \u2014 which was very much kept out of the spotlight, deliberately \u2014 she wants to \u2018own\u2019 this romance, and not hide it away.",
        "'Taylor just wants to live her life, and be happy. She\u2019s told pals Matty is flying to Nashville over the weekend to support her on the next leg of her tour.'DailyMail.com contacted representatives for Taylor for comment.\u00a0",
        "Back in 2015, Matt denied romance rumours with Taylor\u00a0but confirmed they had been texting each other frequently.\u00a0After rumours began circling he confirmed on Australian radio:\u00a0'It's fake. It's all bloody fake. It's a farce!'Yeah, we met each other, we exchanged numbers in the same way that a lot of people in this kind of world do and we spoke occasionally.'And she's the biggest pop star in the world and I'm in Australia. There's no like, relationship or anything happening. It's just funny how people really, really buy into that.'\u00a0"
