        "The Lord Mayor of Westminster said the King\u2019s coronation will \u201cshare a new Britain\u201d and is \u201clooking forward\u201d to the historic event.",
        "Councillor Hamza Taouzzale, 23, the youngest person and first Muslim to be Lord Mayor, will be donning his blue and gold ceremonial robe at Westminster Abbey to represent the city of Westminster on Saturday as well as attending plenty of street parties in the lead-up to the event.He said the \u201conce-in-a-lifetime experience\u201d will be \u201creally good fun\u201d and he is most looking forward to the moment the King is crowned as he hopes the coronation will showcase a new Britain bringing people together.\u201cThe thing I\u2019m most looking forward to is when they put the actual crown on. When they put the crown on he\u2019s obviously King, but it\u2019s all really official,\u201d he told the PA news agency.\u201cI hope the ceremony shares a new Britain. Whether you agree or don\u2019t agree with the monarchy is another story but if the coronation is able to bring people together, then I think it\u2019s done its job.\u201d For me, the coronation is about people coming together, and that's the best thing we can do at a time like this  Lord Mayor of Westminster Hamza Taouzzale  In the lead-up to the event, the Lord Mayor has attended coronation teas and multi-faith exchanges and even unveiled one of only four Royal Mail coronation post boxes \u2013 one in each of the nations \u2013 painted in red, white, and blue.",
        "He described the unveiling as \u201creally cool\u201d and said it helped him \u201cget into the spirit of things\u201d as he hopes to attend as many street parties as possible.While some critics have branded the event as a waste of taxpayers\u2019 money, Coun Taouzzale feels that bringing the community together is \u201cthe best thing we can do at a time like this\u201d.\u201cI\u2019ve grown up in Westminster my whole life. I understand the positives and negatives. I still live in the estate that I grew up in. I can see both worlds really clearly,\u201d he said.\u201cBut for me, the coronation is about people coming together, and that\u2019s the best thing we can do at a time like this.\u201cAlthough we are celebrating the King and the Queen on their coronation, it\u2019s about celebrating each other as a community.\u201d",
        "The Lord Mayor welcomes street parties and community events to celebrate the coronation after a \u201ctricky\u201d few years following the Covid-19 pandemic.\u201cIt\u2019s been a bit up and down and all over the place with Covid \u2026 so to have a ceremony like this, to have all the street parties and have all the Big Help on Monday, to have all the community events surrounding the coronation, is fantastic,\u201d he said.He has advised that the public should have fun but \u201cwithin reason\u201d encouraging people to host parties that involve the whole community.",
        "\u201cI\u2019m quite big on the family friendly stuff, so make sure that it involves the whole community, involve the whole family because it\u2019s something where people of any age, any faith or any background can enjoy and have fun,\u201d he said.Despite feeling some pressure to represent the city of Westminster on Saturday, the Lord Mayor is combatting nerves by reading about the coronation in 1953 to draw inspiration from his predecessors.\u201cIt feels a little bit nerve-racking because you\u2019re there to do your job, you\u2019re there to represent hundreds of thousands of people, all of those who live in Westminster or work or make up our great city,\u201d he said.",
        "\u201cBut a lot of the time, it\u2019s all about making sure you do the job right.\u201cSome of the books describe what the Mayor of Westminster did or the Mayor of Marylebone or Mayor of Paddington, and what their roles were within the coronation,\u201d he explained.\u201cFor me, it\u2019s about learning about what they did to see what we can do today. Very few people can remember the last coronation, so to have those books and to have that information helps ease the nerves a little bit.\u201dAlongside being Lord Mayor of Westminster, Councillor Taouzzale is deputy high steward at Westminster Abbey and said the coronation is a \u201cprivilege\u201d to be a part of.",
        "\u201cWe in Westminster are happy to be hosting it. It\u2019s a privilege to be part of this great city.\u201d"
