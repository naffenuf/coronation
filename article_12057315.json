        "Senior Lib Dems yesterday opened the door to a post-election deal with LabourRead more:\u00a0BBC backlash after presenter caught saying 'I like Wes Streeting'Labour refused to rule out a coalition with the Liberal Democrats yesterday after experts warned that Sir Keir Starmer has not convinced voters he is ready to govern.",
        "The party\u2019s health spokesman Wes Streeting ducked questions over whether it would be prepared to cut a backroom deal with the Lib Dems and other minor parties in return for propping up Sir Keir.It comes after last week\u2019s local election results where Labour overtook the Conservatives as the largest party in local government.Senior Lib Dems yesterday opened the door to a post-election deal with Labour \u2013 and indicated they would demand an end to Britain\u2019s first-past-the-post electoral system in return.The SNP has already indicated it would be prepared to prop up Sir Keir\u2019s party in return for another independence referendum.",
        "Westminster leader Stephen Flynn has said his party was in \u2018prime position to pull the strings of a minority UK government\u2019.Today he will urge Labour and Lib Dem voters in Scotland to vote SNP to block the Tories and \u2018ensure Scotland holds the balance of power at Westminster\u2019.Experts have argued that the local election results suggest Sir Keir\u2019s party has not done enough to secure an overall majority.Elections experts Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher said the results equated to a seven-point lead for Labour over the Conservatives \u2013 enough to make it the largest party in a hung Parliament but \u2018still short of a majority\u2019.\u00a0Polling guru Peter Kellner said it was \u2018by no means clear\u2019 the party was heading for a majority, despite Sir Keir\u2019s boast last week that he was \u2018on course\u2019 for No 10.",
        "Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey yesterday ruled out a coalition deal with the Conservatives as he cosied up to Labour.",
        "Sir Ed said his party\u2019s priority was getting rid of Tory MPs \u2013 and even claimed he had \u2018spent my life fighting the Conservatives\u2019, despite serving with them for years in a coalition cabinet. But he left the door open to a deal with Labour and said changing the voting system to proportional representation would have to be \u2018on the table\u2019 in any talks.Former leader Sir Vince Cable said there could be a tacit understanding between the Lib Dems and Labour not to fight each other hard at the next election in order to maximise damage to the Tories. He told the BBC\u2019s World This Weekend show that this could create a position where Labour would have to \u2018depend on support from outside\u2019 to form a government.Mr Streeting said a Lib Dem recovery was a \u2018path to a Labour victory\u2019 but his party was \u2018not even entertaining\u2019 the idea of a coalition at this stage.He added that Labour was \u2018confident but not complacent\u2019 about securing an overall majority at next year\u2019s general election.The developments came as the Tory inquest continued over last week\u2019s bombshell election results, which saw the party lose more than 1,000 council seats.",
        "Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer acknowledged voters were \u2018frustrated and angry\u2019 with the Conservatives after 13 years in power.During a round of interviews she said the fallout from the pandemic and soaring inflation following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine had dented the party\u2019s popularity.She insisted that Rishi Sunak was focused on the public\u2019s priorities and was \u2018starting to deliver in a quiet way\u2019.However, other senior Conservatives called for major changes in approach. Sir John Redwood said many Tory voters had \u2018gone on strike\u2019 last week in protest at high taxes and soaring immigration."
