        "Ed Sheeran has said he is \u201cobviously very happy\u201d after winning a US copyright lawsuit over his song Thinking Out Loud, but vented his frustration at having missed his grandmother\u2019s funeral for the trial.",
        "The British musician was alleged to have used parts of Marvin Gaye\u2019s Let\u2019s Get It On for his 2014 hit, which claimants said shared \u201cstriking similarities\u201d with the 1973 soul classic.",
        "He was taken to court by the family of Ed Townsend, who co-wrote Gaye\u2019s song.After his win, Sheeran described himself as \u201cjust a guy with a guitar who loves writing music for people to enjoy\u201d and criticised the lawsuit.Speaking outside court in New York, he said: \u201cI\u2019m obviously very happy with the outcome of this case and it looks like I\u2019m not going to have to retire from my day job after all. These claims and the people who manipulate songwriters for their own gain need to be stopped so that the creative process can carry on and we can all get back to making music  Ed Sheeran  \u201cAt the same time, I am absolutely frustrated that baseless claims like this are allowed to go to court at all.\u201dHe added: \u201cHaving to be in New York for this trial has meant that I have missed being with my family at my grandmother\u2019s funeral in Ireland. I won\u2019t get that time back.\u201cWe need songwriters and the wider musical community to come together to celebrate and support creativity.",
        "\u201cThese claims and the people who manipulate songwriters for their own gain need to be stopped so that the creative process can carry on and we can all get back to making music.\u201cI am not and never will allow myself to be a piggy bank for someone to shake.\u201dSheeran thanked the jury for \u201cmaking the decision that will help protect the creative process of songwriters here in the United States and all around the world\u201d, and \u201call the songwriters, musicians and fans who have reached out with messages of support\u201d for him.He also thanked his legal team and the co-writer of Thinking Out Loud, Amy Wadge.The trial in New York included several live singing performances by Sheeran.After deliberating for just under three hours, jurors found Sheeran had not infringed on the family\u2019s copyright interest in Gaye\u2019s song.Sheeran stood up and hugged members of his legal team as the verdict was returned.It comes just a day after the singer was forced to miss the funeral of his grandmother due to being stateside for the trial, though he reportedly watched it via livestream.During the trial, jurors heard from numerous industry experts and musicologists, as well as Sheeran himself.At one point in his testimony, the musician picked up his guitar to play a rendition of Thinking Out Loud, to explain his songwriting process.",
        "He reportedly became frustrated at times, describing the testimony of one of the plaintiff\u2019s expert witnesses as \u201ccriminal\u201d and said he found the entire case \u201creally insulting\u201d.Townsend\u2019s family brought the case against Sheeran, his label Warner Music Group and his music publisher Sony Music Publishing, in 2017.Their original complaint claimed Sheeran had infringed on their interest in Gaye\u2019s song by copying its \u201charmonic progressions, melodic and rhythmic elements\u201d \u2013 which they described as the \u201cheart\u201d of the track.\u201cThe defendants copied the \u2018heart\u2019 of Let\u2019s (Get It On) and repeated it continuously throughout Thinking (Out Loud),\u201d their claim stated, adding it had been done \u201cwithout consent, credit or compensation\u201d.\u201cAs a result, members of the public have been deceived and/or confused into thinking that Thinking (Out Loud) is the independent creation of the defendants.\u201dThe complaint added the conduct, which had resulted in \u201cillegal revenues\u201d, had been \u201cknowing and willful\u201d.The family requested a preliminary and permanent injunction against any future recording, distribution or public performance of Thinking Out Loud.During the trial, Ben Crump, representing the Townsend family, had said the case was about \u201cgiving credit where credit is due\u201d.The verdict in the US trial follows a similar but separate copyright case that Sheeran faced in London last year over his 2017 hit Shape Of You."
