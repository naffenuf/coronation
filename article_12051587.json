        "Rangers midfielder Ianis Hagi hopes to use the end of the season to complete his long journey to full fitness.",
        "The 24-year-old Romania international made his return from a year-long knee injury in January when he came on as a substitute in the 2-0 cinch Premiership win over St Johnstone at Ibrox.Hagi has made one start \u2013 against Partick Thistle in the Scottish Cup \u2013 and six\u00a0substitute appearances in total under boss Michael Beale and ahead of Sunday\u2019s league visit of Aberdeen, he opened up on his fitness tribulations.He said: \u201cACL injuries are honestly no joke. It is really hard.\u201cYou go through so many emotions, and once you\u2019re back, most players are at their peaks in the season. I\u2019ve basically started from zero and it\u2019s the beginning of my pre-season.\u201cThere\u2019s not much time for training because at this football club you play every three or four days, and you need to deliver when you\u2019re on the pitch.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s a really tricky one where you need to fight through it and find minutes now and then.\u201cI\u2019ve been in constant communication with the manager, see what is best for me and at the same time you want to win.\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to push myself to the limits, to where I want to be.\u201cI\u2019ve been building up my minutes, but it feels like I\u2019m enjoying my football more and more. It\u2019s unfortunate because the season finishes really quickly, but with these last five games, and the two with the national team, hopefully I can make the most of it.\u201d"
