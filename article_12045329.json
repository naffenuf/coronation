        "A man who was put into care aged 15 before becoming homeless in his 20s, feeling the cold in his \u201cbones\u201d and contemplating suicide, has transformed his life with ice skating and said he \u201cwould be dead\u201d if it were not for charitable help that introduced him to the sport and gave his life \u201cpurpose\u201d.",
        "Brad Gigg, 26, who lives in Oxford, said his start in life was \u201cpretty rocky\u201d after he lived in an \u201cabusive\u201d home from the age of eight.He was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) at the age of 13 \u2013 a condition which affects people\u2019s behaviour \u2013 and struggled to \u201caccept boundaries\u201d and \u201cfollow rules\u201d, which meant he was \u201cnigh-on uncontrollable\u201d.He said he was excluded from school and started going out more, \u201cdrinking at all hours\u201d, smoking weed, getting into fights, and being \u201cbeaten up\u201d, until one day, aged 15, he said he came home and saw his belongings had been left at the front door.At this point, Brad said he felt he had \u201cnothing\u201d, and he spent the following two and a half years with different families in care.",
        "He lived in various properties after leaving the care system, but since he was struggling with his mental health and living a life of \u201csoulless isolation\u201d, he stopped looking for jobs, could not afford his rent, and became homeless aged 23.However, with the help of Emmaus Oxford \u2013 a charity that supports people to work their way out of homelessness \u2013 he was offered a second chance and has \u201cchanged his life for the better\u201d and, at the height of his depression, discovered a new hobby of ice skating.",
        "He now ice skates several times per week and wants to become a learning mentor to support vulnerable teenagers and to \u201cstop kids going through the life\u201d he has had.\u201cI would be dead if not for Emmaus,\u201d Brad said. \u201cI cannot convey the level of support and help that I got from Emmaus.\u201cThey\u2019ve not only saved my life, but they\u2019ve given my life purpose and changed it for the better.\u201dBrad explained that his time in care was \u201clike night and day\u201d and he lived with various families \u2013 known as \u201cplacements\u201d \u2013 over a two and a half-year period.",
        "He said he lived with some \u201clovely\u201d carers, but leaving the system aged 18 was \u201cthe biggest blow to his life\u201d.While he had an aftercare team, moved into his own flat and secured a job, after about a year on his own he \u201cstarted to collapse, mentally\u201d.\u201cI stopped talking to people, I stopped going outside, I stopped buying food that was good and would last; I spent all my time playing a game on my phone,\u201d Brad said.\u201cI didn\u2019t ask for help, I stopped paying rent, I stopped going to jobseekers, so therefore I couldn\u2019t pay rent, I didn\u2019t look for work, and I just existed for a year.",
        "\u201cAll that came to an end when I was removed from the flat, but I think, after a life of feeling like I\u2019m secluded, never really being able to turn to anyone or physically ask for help without feeling like I\u2019m going to be rejected, I feel like it was all doomed to fail.\u201dBrad was then housed in a B&amp;B after contacting his local council, but since \u201chis life had been so shattered\u201d, he became \u201cselectively mute\u201d for several years.",
        "He feels the trauma from his past caught up with him and he \u201ccompletely shut down\u201d.He then lived with a friend before moving in with his then-girlfriend, but after that relationship ended and he had nowhere else to go, Brad was introduced to Emmaus Oxford, aged 20.Brad said Emmaus Oxford housed him and helped him find a new job, but after about a year his mental health started to \u201cimplode\u201d.He said he became \u201caggressive\u201d towards others, his ADHD worsened, and he ended up being transferred to other Emmaus branches before becoming homeless aged 23.Brad then spent the winter months living in a tent on the streets in Oxford.\u201cI never really realised how cold cold could get,\u201d Brad said.\u201cIt was the kind of cold where you would step out in the morning and your bones would get cold before your skin did; it\u2019s a horrific feeling.",
        "\u201cYou\u2019d have to spend 20 minutes warming yourself back up again.\u201dBrad said he managed to obtain meals from food banks and find places to wash, but \u201cthe thing he missed most about living on the streets was a plug socket\u201d.He would use his phone to speak to friends and his mother, as they had started to talk again, and look for jobs, but once he ran out of battery, he was cut off from the world.He continued: \u201cIt represented the ability to live my life autonomously.\u201cI had to rely on the grace of others to charge my phone; I had to wait for certain periods or to have Wi-Fi, and then I could start living my life again.\u201cThat, to me, was the biggest loss, not being able to live life as a human being.\u201dWhile Brad said being homeless was extremely difficult, it gave him the opportunity to reflect on his actions, and he decided to contact Emmaus Oxford again.",
        "By this point, aged 25, he said he had accrued around \u00a36,000 of debt, \u201cfelt incredibly depressed\u201d, and had contemplated suicide.However, he said it was at the height of his depression that he discovered ice skating.\u201cOne day, I was feeling low, and something just came into my brain and said, \u2018If you don\u2019t do anything, if you isolate again, you\u2019re going to kill yourself\u2019,\u201d he said.",
        "\u201cPart of me didn\u2019t want to die, even if I felt like I deserved it, so I looked at things I could do and what I\u2019ve done before, and in the Venn diagram, ice skating was in the middle.\u201cI just decided to start doing that; I needed a hobby, I needed a place where I could go to socialise, to force myself to talk to people, and I\u2019ve never really looked back.\u201dBrad feels his main strengths are his \u201cincredible ability to adapt\u201d and his \u201ctenacity\u201d \u2013 and he wanted to prove to Emmaus Oxford that he had changed.",
        "One day, he cycled nearly 10 miles from Cowley to Abingdon in Oxfordshire to enquire about a new job.After Emmaus Oxford heard of his efforts, Brad said they offered him another chance and provided him with accommodation and a job, and he now works as an Emmaus Companion.Brad feels the charity saved his life and made him feel he was \u201cworth something to people\u201d.\u201cGoing from I may not have that second chance, to then finding out that I\u2019d not only earned it, but I got it, made me feel like maybe I\u2019m not a lost cause,\u201d he said.Through the charity, Brad has received support for his mental health and ADHD, and he is continuing to ice skate several times a week, as he loves the \u201crush\u201d of the sport.",
        "He has also started talking to community groups about Emmaus and homelessness, including a local school, and taking part in fundraisers, which has been rewarding.He hopes to study to become a learning mentor to help others and \u201cgive back\u201d, and he wishes to stress the importance of asking for help, as that is one of his biggest regrets.\u201cI want to stop kids going through the life I have, and if I can stop it with my life experience, that would be the ultimate goal for me,\u201d he said.\u201cBut if I could give any advice, I\u2019d say, just beg for help.\u201cAsk anyone \u2013 ask your council, ask a friend \u2013 just find someone, because I believe all of my problems could have been solved if I had just asked for help, but I never knew that I could.\u201dTo find out more about Emmaus, visit emmaus.org.uk."
