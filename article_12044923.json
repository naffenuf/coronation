He allowed five earned runs on eight hits in an 8-5 win over Oakland on April 27.\"I wanted to get through six or seven innings, minimum,\" Ohtani said through an interpreter. \"More than the strikeouts, I'm more disappointed that I didn't get that far in the game.\"Ohtani recorded his seven outs via strikeout.",
        "\"He was good,\" Los Angeles manager Phil Nevin said. \"There are some good hitters over there.\"Ohtani went 3 for 5 and drove in a run.

        "Trout was extra exuberant after the blast, pounding Nevin with an aggressive high five as he reached the dugout.\"I might have a broken finger right now,\" Nevin joked. \"He came in swinging at everybody.\"Trout recorded his fifth career go-ahead homer in the ninth inning or later.\"I was pumped,\" Trout said. \"I've been battling, I've been grinding.\"Lamb got the rally started with the fifth pinch-hit home run of his career.\"We've got a good team,\" Lamb said. \"We've got the pitchers, we've got the hitters. It says something that we haven't quite put it all together. We're still playing pretty good baseball. I look at that as a positive. We can only get better.\"Brandon Drury also homered for the Angels. Ryan Tepera (2-1) earned the win and Carlos Estevez picked up his seventh save of the season.Dylan Carlson and Nolan Gorman homered for St. Louis, which at 10-21 is off to its worst start since the 1973 squad opened the season 8-23.Carlson put the Cardinals ahead 4-3 with a two-run homer that capped a three-run outburst in the fourth inning. It was his first homer of the season. Nolan Arenado and Willson Contreras opened the inning with back-to-back doubles.Gorman gave the Cardinals a 1-0 lead with his seventh homer of the season in the first. Drury tied the game with his sixth homer of the season in the second inning.",

He is considered day to day.TRAINER\u00b4S ROOMCardinals: RHP Adam Wainwright will make his first start of the season on Saturday against Detroit.
