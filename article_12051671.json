        "Will Fish is delighted to have become a Hibernian mainstay over the past few months after fearing his loan move from Manchester United was not going to plan.",
        "The 20-year-old centre-back joined the Easter Road club on a season-long deal last summer in a bid to increase his exposure to first-team football.With Rocky Bushiri, Ryan Porteous and Paul Hanlon all ahead of him in the pecking order, Fish had to wait until January to make his first start \u2013 and even then it was a disaster as he was played out of position at right-back before being subbed at half-time in a 3-0 defeat at city rivals Hearts.However, the sale of Porteous to Watford and a serious injury sustained by Bushiri paved the way for Fish to start each of Hibs\u2019 last 11 matches.\u201cYou have doubts, but I always had the backing of the staff,\u201d he said when asked if he feared his move to Hibs was not working out. \u201cThey were always in dialogue with me and they said I would get my chance and they\u2019ve stuck to their word.\u201cIn football, you have to get a bit of luck. Porto left and Rocky got injured and I managed to get my chance, and I\u2019ve done alright. The more games you play, the more experience you get and you feel more confident.",
        "\u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed my time here massively. I\u2019ve had some bumps along the road but I feel like I\u2019ve come out the other side better for it. I\u2019ve really enjoyed it and I owe a lot to Hibs for giving me this chance.\u201d",
        "Before joining Hibs, Fish had made only three first-team appearances \u2013 one as a sub for parent club United and two while on loan at Stockport last term. With that in mind, the 20-year-old has been grateful to have 33-year-old Hanlon to help guide him at Easter Road.\u201cPaul\u2019s been great,\u201d Fish said ahead of Saturday\u2019s match at home to St Mirren. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t ask for a better centre-half partner for my first few games in men\u2019s football. On and off the pitch, he\u2019s great.\u201cHe helps me through the games and we discuss things together. He\u2019s a top lad.\u201dFish is contracted to United until 2025 but is expected to go on loan again next term.\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said when asked if he will return to Hibs. \u201cI\u2019m just focusing on the next five games and then we can take it from there and see what happens.\u201cI\u2019ve still got time on my contract but I think everyone is on the same page that I need to go out and play men\u2019s football again (next season) so that will be the plan.\u201d"
