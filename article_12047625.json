        "Jurors heard former president Donald Trump blast a woman who accused him of rape as a \u201cnut job\u201d and \u201cmentally sick\u201d in a video recording that was shown on Thursday during the trial of her federal lawsuit.",
        "A transcript of Trump\u2019s remarks about accuser E Jean Carroll emerged in court filings before the trial.But the deposition played in the courtroom allowed jurors to hear Trump speak about the case in his own voice. Other sections of the recording were shown in court on Wednesday.Thursday\u2019s portions also included Trump standing by his repeated prior comment that Ms Carroll was \u201cnot my type\u201d and his defence \u2014 as \u201clocker room talk\u201d \u2014 of his notorious boasts on a 2005 \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d hot-mic recording about grabbing women\u2019s genitals.Ms Carroll, a 79-year-old writer, alleges that Trump raped her in an upscale New York department store dressing room on an unspecified date in spring 1996.According to Ms Carroll, they ran into each other, got into light-hearted banter about trying on lingerie and went jokingly into the fitting room, where he slammed the door and suddenly became violent.Trump, 76, says that she fabricated the entire encounter and that he has never met her, except for a brief exchange of pleasantries at a 1987 social event.\u201cI think she\u2019s sick, mentally sick,\u201d Trump said calmly during the deposition, which was taken in October.He added: \u201cShe said that I did something to her that never took place. There was no anything. I know nothing about this nut job.\u201d",
        "Trump has not attended the trial, and his lawyers have said he will not testify or call any witnesses on his behalf.However, during remarks on Thursday to reporters while on a golf trip to Ireland, Trump suggested he would \u201cprobably attend\u201d the trial, which is expected to wrap up next week.His lawyers continued to say there were no plans for him to do so.Trump, who irked trial Judge Lewis Kaplan with social media posts criticizing the case at the trial\u2019s outset, also repeated his claim that it\u2019s a political \u201cscam\u201d and knocked Mr Kaplan, a Bill Clinton appointee, as an \u201cextremely hostile\u201d and \u201crough judge\u201d who \u201cdoesn\u2019t like me very much\u201d.The Associated Press typically does not name people who say they have been sexually assaulted unless they come forward publicly, as Ms Carroll has done."
