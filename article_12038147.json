        "Chris Packham has had an \u201cenormous amount of puerile, offensive and damaging material\u201d published about him, the High Court has heard at the start of his libel claim.",
        "The TV naturalist, 61, is suing three men over nine articles which claimed he defrauded people into donating to a charity to rescue tigers while knowing the animals were well looked after, described in court as \u201ctiger fraud\u201d.Dominic Wightman, editor of the online site Country Squire Magazine, is defending the libel claim along with writer Nigel Bean and a third man, Paul Read. An argument that he does not genuinely hold those beliefs but has instead sought to defraud the public for money is, at best, an ambitious one  Jonathan Price  The strongly denied allegations, repeated in several tweets and videos, relate to Mr Packham\u2019s involvement with the Wildheart Trust, which runs a wildlife sanctuary on the Isle of Wight.At the start of the trial on Tuesday, the High Court in London heard that the environmentalist was accused of \u201cabusing his privileged position as a BBC presenter\u201d to dishonestly appeal for donations for the charity, which he and his partner Charlotte Corney are trustees of.Jonathan Price, for the presenter, said: \u201cIt is now a facility that rescues animals in need of a forever home, as they put it, because for whatever reason they are unwanted by their former owners.\u201cA central allegation in this case that it is fraudulent to attach the word rescue to this process.\u201d",
        "The environmentalist \u2013 who is expected to give evidence on Wednesday \u2013 was accused of misleading the public into donating by claiming tigers had been rescued from a circus while he allegedly knew they had been well-treated and were instead donated.Mr Price said in written submissions: \u201cMr Packham is well-known for his decades of vociferous campaigning for, and strongly held beliefs on, animal welfare and nature conservation issues. It is clear that the tigers had not been rescued from a circus, were not then in need of rescue, and were not rescued by Mr Packham  Nicholas O\u2019Brien  \u201cAn argument that he does not genuinely hold those beliefs but has instead sought to defraud the public for money is, at best, an ambitious one.\u201dThe court was told that Mr Packham had been described by the defendants as a fraud, a \u201cnotorious liar\u201d, of having an \u201cobvious nastiness\u201d, and of playing the \u201cAsperger\u2019s victim card\u201d.Mr Price argued that the three men intended to run \u201ca full-frontal attack\u201d on Mr Packham\u2019s character during the legal case and to get him fired.\u201cAs the litigation has progressed, the defendants have published an enormous amount of puerile, offensive and damaging material about the claimant, often under the guise of fundraising for their defence,\u201d the barrister said in written submissions.",
        "Nicholas O\u2019Brien, for Mr Wightman and Mr Bean, said the articles in the claim were true and could also be defended as under the public interest.In written submissions, the barrister said: \u201cIt is clear that the tigers had not been rescued from a circus, were not then in need of rescue, and were not rescued by Mr Packham.\u201d",
        "Mr O\u2019Brien said the pair \u201ccontend that Mr Packham knew the statements were false, and they were therefore made dishonestly\u201d.\u201cThey were also fraudulent in that they were made with a view to a gain and constituted an abuse of his privileged position as a BBC presenter,\u201d he added.David Price KC, for retired computer programmer Mr Read, said he was not responsible for the publications attributed to him as he was a \u201cmere proofreader\u201d.In written submissions, he continued: \u201cMr Read\u2019s proofread version was then subjected to further amendment by Mr Wightman and/or Mr Bean before publication.\u201dMr Price added that Mr Wightman had admitted responsibility.\u201cThe fact that Mr Read was given courtesy byline credits\u2026 cannot override the hard evidence as to his limited involvement,\u201d he added.The trial before Mr Justice Saini is due to conclude on May 12, with a decision expected at a later date."
