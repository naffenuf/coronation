I support an Australian as Australia's head of state  Anthony Albanese  He said: \u201cI support an Australian as Australia\u2019s head of state.\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t respect the institutions and it certainly doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t respect King Charles, both as a person but also as Australia\u2019s head of state.\u201cThat is our constitutional arrangement that we have.",
        "\u201cAs the Australian Prime Minister I will respect the arrangements that we have across the board.\u201dHe said he could not go into details of the meeting because of protocol.He added: \u201cI can say though that it was very warm, I appreciated the discussion that we had and that King Charles has a great love for and affection for Australia.\u201dHe said he told the King that he and the Queen Consort would be welcome visitors to Australia, as would any other member of the royal family.",
