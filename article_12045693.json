It wasn\u2019t easy and it took some getting used to.'I wasn\u2019t even sure I liked it much at first, but as I regained my confidence, my freedom and myself after so long, I discovered that it really isn\u2019t a clich\u00e9 to say happiness really does comes from within.'She added: 'I still get the occasional well-meaning comment \u2014 that I\u2019ll get \"snapped up soon\" rather like a supermarket meal deal. People don\u2019t like to believe that a woman can be happier single.'MailOnline contacted a representative for Paul for comment at the time.Alex split from Paul over his affair with Marcela who worked on the American version of Bake Off.They got back together but finally went their separate ways in 2017, with Alex citing infidelity as the reason for the split.",
        "Most ovarian cysts occur naturally and go away in a few months without needing any treatment.An ovarian cyst is a fluid-filled sac that develops on an ovary.\u00a0They're very common and do not usually cause any symptoms.Ovarian cysts may affect both ovaries at the same time, or only one.\u00a0An ovarian cyst usually only causes symptoms if it splits (ruptures), is very large or blocks the blood supply to the ovaries.In these cases, you may have: pelvic pain, pain during sex, difficulty emptying your bowels, a frequent need to urinate, heavy periods, irregular periods or lighter periods than normal, bloating and a swollen tummy, feeling very full after only eating a little or difficulty getting pregnant \u2013 although fertility is usually unaffected by ovarian cysts.The two main types of ovarian cyst are: functional ovarian cysts \u2013 cysts that develop as part of the menstrual cycle and are usually harmless and short-lived; these are the most common type or pathological ovarian cysts \u2013 cysts that form as a result of abnormal cell growth; these are much less common.Source: NHS\u00a0"
