        "Kilmarnock midfielder Rory McKenzie admits the painful memories of relegation are spurring him on to avoid the same fate two years on.",
        "McKenzie is one of the few survivors of the team that lost to Dundee in the play-offs before coming straight back up as cinch Championship title winners.Derek McInnes and his squad occupy 11th place in the Premiership which would consign them to another play-off but there are five matches left to save their top-flight status, starting with Saturday\u2019s trip to Motherwell.McKenzie said: \u201cI would much rather be playing in the top six but I\u2019m relishing the game in terms of how big a game it is for the club.\u201cYou want to play in big games and for a club like Kilmarnock, having been in this position, I know how bad it feels to be relegated and it just makes it a whole lot bigger. In that sense it\u2019s a great occasion and a good game to go out and win.\u201dThe 29-year-old is using past pain as motivation.",
        "\u201cDefinitely, I have been thinking about it the last few weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a horrible, horrible feeling and I do not want to feel that again.\u201cI have let the boys know that and we are going to do what we can to not have any sort of feeling like that again.\u201dMcKenzie was raised in Troon and his association with Killie goes back many years through his formative spell in the club\u2019s academy but he does not feel his affection for the club should make him any more determined than his team-mates to help the cause.",
        "\u201cI don\u2019t think it should,\u201d he said. \u201cIt might come across as that because I am from here and I know the club better than most, but if you are a professional it\u2019s not something you want to have on your CV.\u201cYes, I am from here but it should mean the exact\u00a0same for everyone in the squad whether you are here full-time or on loan. You don\u2019t want to go back to your parent club on the back of a relegated season.\u201cEveryone has their reasons why and it should mean the same to everyone.\u201dKillie are looking to follow up on their first league away win of the season last time out against St Mirren.McKenzie: \u201cIt was huge because it became a thing. For one reason or other we weren\u2019t starting games well. We were conceding early and there was no real belief we could get back in the game.\u201cLast week we performed well. It was a big game for St Mirren and it was a\u00a0good crowd and to come out on top against a good side was a big confidence boost.\u201dThe attacking midfielder admits preparing for an away game on the back of a win feels different.\u201cI would say so, especially when your next game is away from home,\u201d he said.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s a huge confidence boost because I would be sitting here answering the same questions if we hadn\u2019t won two weeks ago. So that\u2019s quite pleasing.\u201cYou are asked why the away form was so poor and we didn\u2019t know, or we don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a frustrating one because last week just shows if we do everything right and it goes to plan, it\u2019s sometimes quite straightforward.\u201dKillie have Joe Wright, Fraser Murray and Liam Polworth back from illness and injury and Kyle Vassell is set to feature despite suffering a hamstring issue in Paisley.\u201cHe is still not perfect but he has always been a quick healer,\u201d manager Derek McInnes said.\u201cWe got him scanned and we got him moving again. We feel Kyle is a key player for us so we would much rather have him out there.\u201d"
