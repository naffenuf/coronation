        "He's been one of the hardest working singers in Hollywood for decades.\u00a0",
        "And\u00a0Lionel Richie has continued to ramp up his workload with a whirlwind month spent celebrating his daughter's wedding in the South Of France before jetting to the UK for the King's Coronation.\u00a0The veteran performer, 73, showed he has no plans to slow down in his older years as he enjoys a whirlwind trip around Europe.\u00a0First up was a brief stop in Cannes to see Sofia Richie, 24,\u00a0walk down the aisle with music executive\u00a0Elliot Grainge\u00a0in late April.\u00a0Lionel had an important role in the ceremony\u00a0at the luxury Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc, giving away his youngest daughter.\u00a0",
        "During an interview with Extra, the Endless Love singer recalled the big day, saying: 'Baby Girl got married. When I say that\u2026 it's a great feeling, I must say, I've known Elliot since he was nine years old. So I know the groom really well.'It was a moment where, yes, I was letting her go, but I was also gaining a family. The family is getting huge right about now, but we are happy.'\u00a0'There's a thing down South we always say: \"Who's your people?\" Well, I know his people, so it really is a real wonder to see them in love and just as happy as I've ever seen my little girl and Elliot.'",
        "And the Stuck On You singer revealed what he and Sofia talked about as he walked her down the aisle.'She spent the whole time walking down the aisle: \"I love you dad, I love you dad, I love you dad,\" and I go, \"You're killing me. You're killing me.\"\u00a0'But that's what a dad wants to hear, and I love Baby Girl so much, and the family was there to root her on.'\u00a0The All Night Long singer also gushed about the big day on Instagram, writing:\u00a0'My little girl is all grown up and starting her own journey with the love of her life.\u00a0'You'll always be my little bird, but I'm so proud of the woman you've become. Endless Love to you and Elliot.'",
        "While Sofia and Elliott have been enjoying a romantic honeymoon in the Maldives, Lionel has been in England preparing for the coronation.\u00a0While he may have\u00a0entertained a billion people worldwide at the 1984 Olympics and boasts more than 40 hit singles, he said playing for the King will\u00a0be \u2018the best thing ever\u2019.The Hello star has been accompanied by his glamorous model girlfriend, Lisa Parigi, 40 years his junior, on the trip and met with\u00a0the monarch and the Queen Consort at Buckingham Palace ahead of the coronation concert.",
        "Lionel\u00a0has been an ambassador for the Prince\u2019s Trust charity, which helps vulnerable young people, since the 1980s and said he didn\u2019t hesitate when asked if he would headline Sunday\u2019s event at Windsor Castle.\u2018This is going to be so much fun,\u2019 he said. \u2018Does this ever happen? No. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity, so to be a part of it is everything.He said of Charles: \u2018Believe or not he cares. He is hands on. My job is to do the things that he cannot do, interviews and things like that. His time is valuable. So when I am travelling on my tours, this is what I do. I spread the world.\u2019He said the concert was, without a shadow of doubt, one of the most momentous events in his life.\u2018In your career, there are Oscars and then there are Grammys and then there's a Coronation... are you kidding me?! This doesn't happen every day, so am I excited about this? Absolutely! This is going to be the best thing ever!\u2019 he said.\u2018Windsor Castle as the backdrop? Come on, let\u2019s be serious! There is no [other] example of something like this. It\u2019s not like any other time in life or occasion.\u2019Told there would be 1,000 years of history behind him at Windsor, he laughed and said: \u2018Listen, don\u2019t even say that. Now you have me scared!'",
        "As Camilla greeted Lionel and Lisa, she was heard telling the couple: 'It's very nice to see you.'",
        "During their friendly exchange, the singer was seen placing his hand on Camilla's shoulder as the group shared a laugh.\u2018Once the lights get up and the music starts it is just going to be fabulous. Get ready! It\u2019s going to be magical.\u2019Lionel will perform alongside Katy Perry, Andrea Bocelli and Take That at the upcoming live music event.\u00a0The singer added he had also received an invitation to the coronation itself too, saying: \u2018I\u2019ll be there. I mean pinch me somebody. I am really trying to be calm.\u00a0'I\u2019m a kid at Christmastime. And to have the relationship I have with King Charles is just wonderful.'"
