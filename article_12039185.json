        "Leviss dropped a shocking admission when she revealed she had slept over at\u00a0 Sandoval's house in a sneak peek of an upcoming Vanderpump Rules episode set to air on May 3.\u00a0In the most recent episode that aired earlier this week on Wednesday, the TomTom founder\u00a0issued a bare faced lie and claimed 'nothing has happened' between him and the former beauty pageant queen.However, in the sneak peek, Leviss was tardy to work at SUR restaurant in West Hollywood, and Lisa Vanderpump had questioned her lateness, with her explaining she 'overslept' and 'stayed up late.'\u00a0'I went back to Tom's place and we went in the jacuzzi with [Tom] Schwartz,' she added. When Lisa asked where she ended up staying the night, Raquel answered, 'At Sandoval's.'\u00a0The sleepover had taken place when his then-girlfriend, Ariana Madix, was out of town attending her grandmother's funeral.\u00a0",
        "After the admission and Lisa's rather shocked reaction, the TV personality quickly jumped back into the conversation to claim, 'Nothing happened though' while expressing that the situation 'looked bad.'\u00a0Leviss added that she had felt, 'It was easier to sleep on the couch and stay the night.'\u00a0Vanderpump didn't waste any time to video call Sandoval and get a confirmation of Raquel's statement. 'We hung out for a little bit,' he stated while driving, but added that she 'dipped out' and 'left early.'However, after avoiding the question if she had spent the night or not, Lisa asked for a simple 'Yes' or 'No,' and following a brief moment of silence, Tom stated, 'Yes,' ending the clip.\u00a0\u00a0At the beginning of the 7-minute sneak peek, Raquel and Tom, along with Ariana, Tom Schwartz, Brock Davies, and Scheana Shay enjoyed a glamping trip in celebration of Leviss' birthday.\u00a0The video then transitioned to Lala Kent at her office and was visited by James Kennedy, who previously dated Raquel until their split in December 2021.\u00a0The mother of one told James that she was aware that Raquel had slept over at Tom's house and revealed that Katie Maloney had told her. The clip then cut to 'A few days ago' to show Maloney at Villa Rosa.\u00a0",
        "She had discovered the shocking news when Ken Todd told Lisa Vanderpump, with Katie also in the room, 'I can't believe that Tom Sandoval had Raquel over when Ariana was away.'\u00a0",
        "Lisa already had knowledge of the sleepover due to Leviss being late to work, and her confrontation with both the former beauty pageant queen and the TomTom founder.\u00a0The admission comes shortly after the latest Wednesday, April 26 episode where Sandoval told a lie and stated that 'nothing has happened' between him and Raquel during a confessional on the show.\u00a0The question was asked after James Kennedy's current girlfriend, Ally Lewber, revealed she had seen both Raquel and Tom dancing at a club called The Abbey, with no Ariana in sight.\u00a0Sandoval had also clapped back at Katie after she had claimed that both he and Madix were in an open relationship.\u00a0'It's annoying that Katie would say something like that. It's insulting to not just me but Ariana as well. Raquel and I were not, like, dancing all close in the dark corner of a speakeasy,' he explained during a confessional, adding that 'a bunch of us' went to the bar.\u00a0Despite Tom's claims that nothing physical had happened between him and Leviss, his nearly ten-year relationship with Ariana came to an end earlier last month in March after the affair had come to light.\u00a0",
        "The infidelity had begun last year in August 2022, and lasted for seven months until Ariana discovered intimate FaceTime videos on Tom's phone between him and Raquel.\u00a0Madix then split with the businessman, and has been moving on with the support of her fellow VPR castmates, such as Lala, Scheana, and also Katie.\u00a0She was spotted earlier this month sharing a romantic kiss with fitness coach,\u00a0Daniel Wai, during Coachella.\u00a0Raquel, on the other hand, has checked herself into a mental health facility following the affair, although doubts have been voiced by both Peter Madrigal and Dayna Kathan.",
        "Earlier this week on Tuesday, Tom came to the defense of the model and expressed that she was definitely in a mental health facility, and not away at a lavish resort.\u00a0'Raquel is in a mental facility,' he adamantly stated to TMZ. 'No visitors. She's there, whether she decides to tell you where that is after the fact, that's where Raquel is.'\u00a0'No visitors. No friends. No family. No phones. No nothing,' and then called out both Peter and Dayna, stating that, 'These people have absolutely no idea what's going on.'The new episode of Bravo's hit show, Vanderpump Rules, is slated to air next week on Wednesday, May 3.\u00a0The season is now available to stream exclusively on Hayu in the UK.\u00a0\u00a0"
