        "Celtic manager Ange Postecoglou hinted his team could play with more freedom now they have wrapped up the title.",
        "The Hoops retained their cinch Premiership crown with four games remaining thanks to a 2-0 victory over Hearts at Tynecastle on Sunday.There is no room for dropping off given Celtic face Rangers at Ibrox on Saturday and have a treble to play for with a Scottish Cup final against Inverness to come on June 3.They also have the chance to set a new Scottish top-flight points record of 107 \u2013 beating Brendan Rodgers\u2019 Invincibles team of 2017 by a point \u2013 if they win their final four matches.Postecoglou said: \u201cWe have got an opportunity to (have a special season). We are champions, which is fantastic. There are still four games in the league and we have a cup final to look forward to.\u201cWhy let this opportunity slip to continue to maintain standards?\u201cI think the last three or four weeks we have been playing pretty tight in terms of emotionally.\u201cThe boys knew they were close to achieving something special and the closer you get to something like that, it\u2019s human nature that you tighten up a bit. I think that\u2019s been reflected in our football the last three or four weeks. We have got an opportunity to (have a special season). There are still four games in the league and we have a cup final to look forward to.  Ange Postecoglou  ",
        "\u201cBut through that time they still work so hard for each other, they are still disciplined, they never lose focus. They just have this real determination.\u201cThey are winners, mate. They are winners.\u201dCaptain Callum McGregor believes the competition within the squad will help ensure they retain their edge for the cup final.McGregor, who is going for his fifth treble, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a cup final, we have to prepare well and that includes the last four games. We have to be bang at it, we can\u2019t come off it.",
        "\u201cListen, the manager won\u2019t let us anyway but we just continue to play the way we are playing, stay hungry, and once we get to the cup final we will try to deal with that as best we can, and that will be a consequence of that happening.\u201cEverybody wants to play, that\u2019s why it\u2019s highly competitive to get in the team and stay in the team.\u201cIf you look at the subs who came on on Sunday, Aaron (Mooy) has a huge impact on the game and he is somebody who has been really strong for us this season.\u201cThere\u2019s strength in depth there and I think the guys, when they are in the team, they are desperate to stay in the team. To have that competitive environment for the next four weeks will hopefully stand us in good stead.\u201d",
        "Celtic have the chance to go a full season unbeaten against Rangers, who they have beaten in both cup competitions.\u201cYou don\u2019t need any extra motivation for these games,\u201d McGregor said. \u201cThey are always big games, there\u2019s always something to play for. and I\u2019m sure it will be a highly competitive game again.\u201cWe want to go there and be aggressive in the game and get maximum points.\u201d"
