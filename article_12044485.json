It\u2019s about to start!\u2019The correct response, proclaimed in quick succession by each Junior Member of the Household goes: \u2018You watch it if you like but I have got better things to do.\u2019Following this response, each Junior Member of the Household will turn up the volume on his or her iPad or headphones to the maximum ten.Any further admonition to celebrate will be met by the response: \u2018I can\u2019t hear you!\u2019",
        "11am: Following their arrival into the living room, the Father and Mother of the Household process to their individual seats. In their hands, each will hold a cup of tea, signifying authority. They also bear a copy of the Radio Times, traditional symbol of continuity, knowledge and wisdom.Then, to the question: \u2018Who has taken the wotsit?\u2019The cry will go up: \u2018Where did you see it last? It will be where you last saw it.\u2019This heralds the age-old ritual of Searching for the Remote, in which all the assembled Members of the Household are expected to kneel down and look beneath chairs and sofas for the sacred TV remote control.11.05am: When the sacred handset is retrieved from beneath a cushion, the Father of the Household presses the red button ten times. At each pressing, he will be met with no response, and will issue a solemn curse. At this moment, Junior Members of the Household are expected to chant: \u2018That is the wrong wotsit. It is for the DVD player that we got rid of five years ago.\u2019",
        "11.55pm: As King Charles III announces on television: \u2018I have come not to be served but to serve.\u2019The Father of the Household should respond: \u2018Which reminds me. When are you serving those Hobnobs?\u2019To which the Mother of the Household will reply: \u2018Get them yourself.\u201912 noon: The Recognition. As the Archbishop of Canterbury says: \u2018I here present unto you King Charles, your undoubted King. Wherefore all you who are come this day to do your homage and service: are you willing to do the same?\u2019",
        "The most Junior Member of the Household, the Master of the Slouch, will put his head around the door. Dressed in the age-old uniform of T-shirt, jeans and socks, all dating back to the month before last, he will say: \u2018How long will this be going on for?\u2019Before adding: \u2018Some of us have better things to do. And, by the way, what\u2019s for lunch?\u2019This invocation will be answered with the cry: \u2018Quiet! The King is about to take the Oath!!\u201912.10pm: The Anointing. For the anointing, the Daughter of the Household retires to her bedroom, ritually slamming the door, thus shielding her from view.She pours ancient oil \u2014 St Tropez Fake Tan Natural Glow by Kozmetix \u2014 on her face and shoulders.

        "12.20pm: The Orb. Symbolising the sovereign\u2019s power, the Orb is divided into three sections, each band of jewels symbolising the continents known in the medieval period. The Orb is placed in the monarch\u2019s right hand. At that same moment, the Junior Members of the Household make the Solemn Declaration of the Orb But. Thus:\u2018Orb But there must be something better on!\u2019\u2018Orb But we\u2019ve all had enough of this!\u2019The Father of the Household then rises to his feet and instructs the juniors that the time has come to shut their traps: \u2018So help me God.\u20191pm: The Departure. The ceremony concludes with a procession to the kitchen, for the ritual Rootle Around in the Frigidaire. Then the Father of the Household will take up his rightful seat and proclaim: \u2018It\u2019s what the British do best. That\u2019s what I always say.\u2019Meanwhile, the other Members of the Household will make their rapid departures, and once again, peace will return to the land."
