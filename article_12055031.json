        "Smith was staring down the barrel of unemployment after his club went bust\u00a0Fly-half was signed up by Northampton and fast-tracked into the starting XV\u00a0He joined England squad during the Six Nations despite his Scottish rootsPaint\u00a0me like one of your French girls!\u2019, says Fin Smith, perching on the bonnet of his Ford Fiesta for a quick photograph, surrounded by BMWs and Mercedes in the Franklin\u2019s Gardens car park.",
        "Having just offered a lift to Northampton train station, the young No 10 pushes back the passenger seat and makes a joke at his own expense.\u2018Most of the guys get into their big sports cars and I do a lap and wait for them all to leave! They take the p*** that I\u2019m still driving the little Fiesta that I got as a joint 17th birthday present but I love it. It\u2019s in good nick. With everything that\u2019s gone on this season, I can take having the s******* car in the car park!\u2019Eight months ago, Smith was staring down the barrel of unemployment. He watched his club Worcester, which he joined at 13, fall into bankruptcy and suddenly found himself without a job.Life has moved on quickly. Smith was one of the lucky ones. He was signed up by Northampton, fast-tracked into the starting XV after Dan Biggar\u2019s mid- season exit and is now preparing for a Premiership semi-final against Saracens.",
        "\u2018At the start of September, I had a smashed-up jaw, Worcester were going bust and it was all going to pot,\u2019 says the 20-year-old.\u2018No one was training and I was thinking, \u201cWhat the hell happens now?\u201d There were days when I was looking on uni websites thinking I should probably apply in case I don\u2019t get another club.",
        "\u2018I would probably have moved back in with my parents, gone to the gym every day, done my kicking and got a job in a pub to keep the money ticking over until next season. Guys are still in that situation now. It\u2019s scary. I care about that club so much so it was pretty hard to see it all just get ripped away.\u2018I haven\u2019t had time to reflect on it all because it happened so quickly, but I look back and think, \u201cHow on earth did that happen?\u201d It\u2019s nice to look around the league and see guys like Ollie Lawrence, Ted Hill, Joe Batley and Seb Atkinson ripping it up but it does leave you with a feeling of, \u201cWhat if?\u201d\u2019",
        "Smith\u2019s parents, who both have distinct Scottish accents, traded their Sixways season tickets for Franklin\u2019s Gardens. Rugby runs deep in the family, ever since Smith\u2019s grandad, Tom Elliot, played for Scotland and toured with the British &amp; Irish Lions in 1955. In recent months, however, Smith has nailed his colours to the English mast. His breakthrough season with Northampton was recognised by Steve Borthwick, who called him up for England\u2019s camp throughout the Six Nations.\u2018At the start of the season, international rugby probably wasn\u2019t on my radar,\u2019 says Smith. \u2018Things have happened faster than I expected and it was a cool experience to get a little look in during the Six Nations. Obviously I\u2019ve got Scottish roots. My grandad was prop for Galashiels and was a bit of a legend there. The whole family\u2019s rugby mad. Unfortunately I never got to meet my grandad but there are some cool bits at my granny\u2019s house in Scotland. Lions caps, blazers, things like that.",
        "\u2018My parents moved down here and met at London Scottish Rugby Club in Richmond! Dad played in the 6th team. Mum had probably turned up to watch the 1st team but then met a 6th team weirdo at the bar! The rest is history.\u2018Dad\u2019s from Dunfermline and mum\u2019s from Galashiels but I\u2019m very much desperate to play for England. I grew up here. If things don\u2019t work out then never say never, but at the moment I\u2019m 100 per cent all-in on England, be it now or a couple of years after the World Cup when they start a new cycle. That\u2019s the route I want to take. I\u2019d love to get a shot, and hopefully it\u2019s sooner rather than later.\u2019Still living in the academy house with Kayde Sylvester and Ed Prowse, Smith has been balancing rugby with an Open University degree in Maths and Economics. \u2018My next exam\u2019s on June 12 so it\u2019s only an hour or so of revision at the moment. Macro-economics stuff: tariffs. Loads of stats, loads of graphs, supply and demand.\u2018The exams all come in and around the World Cup camps. Fingers crossed I\u2019ll be involved, but I\u2019m not sure what Steve would say if I need to dip out for a three-hour exam!\u2019",
        "How about a dissertation on Worcester Warriors? \u2018It could be an interesting study: How can a business with two owners go to pot so badly?\u2018These new guys, Atlas, have bought the club and people just want to know what that looks like. The idea of Wasps playing at Sixways, which has been reported this week, doesn\u2019t seem like the most sustainable idea. The fans have been bashed around enough and deserve some clarity.\u2019In the meantime, Smith\u2019s focus rests entirely on Saracens at the StoneX Stadium next Saturday. Northampton are bidding for a first Premiership title since 2014 but first they must overcome the title favourites, built around their steely No 10 Owen Farrell. The head-to-head will be the ultimate test of Smith\u2019s credentials.\u2018It was so interesting to sit in meetings with Owen, Marcus Smith and Nick Evans during the Six Nations and hear them talk about game management.",
        "\u2018If Owen\u2019s playing for Saracens, they\u2019ve got a much higher chance of winning. He\u2019s a legend of the English game. He drives standards. He\u2019s not the fastest or the most flashy player but his skillset is unbelievable. In no means am I pushing to those levels any time soon but it\u2019s good to get up against someone like that. Measure up how close you are on a good day or how far away you are on a bad day.\u2019",
        "If Smith has a good day, we will see Northampton at their free- flowing best, stitching together phases, bidding for an upset.\u2018The worst thing we can do next Saturday is get stuck in an arm wrestle, with Saracens kicking to us and us kicking it straight back,\u2019 he says.\u2018That\u2019s how they\u2019ve won however many trophies over the last five or six years. Obviously we\u2019ll need to kick the ball, but hopefully you won\u2019t see too much of us feeding into what they\u2019re good at. If we\u2019re going to do it, we may as well do it the hard way.\u2019"
