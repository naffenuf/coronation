His favourite word to describe himself was jovial.'\u00a0",

The love and laughter we share together is unbreakable.'",

I don\u2019t need to give you anything about myself or my kids because I\u2019m done, okay?'I do thank you for following me, that's great, but other than that, this is literally just the end and I can\u2019t deal with it anymore.'She then said she wanted to be 'left alone' and had no interest in sharing her personal life with her fans and followers.",
        "'As I said, I want to live a quiet life and make sure my girls are raised really well and they\u2019re happy and they\u2019re happy. That\u2019s all I can wish for them.\u00a0'I just want to be able to go to the shops and not be recognised anymore. Just let them have a normal life. I just want them to have a normal life and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s really hard to ask.'Bride and Prejudice premiered in 2017 on Channel Seven and pulled in almost one million viewers on its first episode.It continued for two more seasons until 2019, when it was quietly cancelled following Micah's shock death.The series also aired in the UK, where it gained a loyal following.Since the series of tragic deaths, Seven has removed Bride and Prejudice from its streaming platforms leaving it unavailable to watch.\u00a0\u00a0"
