The plan is for Matty to walk out on stage mid-show and play two songs.'They will chat to the audience and, at present, the idea is for them to confirm their romance with some kind of PDA \u2014 public display of affection. It won't be anything remotely cheesy though.'",

They first dated, very briefly, almost ten years ago but timings just didn't work out.'The source went on to insist that there was no crossover in Taylor's love life, despite news of her split from Joe emerging last month, insisting that the pair actually broke up in February.",
        "Taylor is currently in the middle of the US leg of her The Eras Tour while The 1975 are on their At Their Very Best concert tour, but the source insisted they have kept in constant communication by texting and Face Timing.The source added: 'As two international megastars, they understand the pressures of one another's jobs better than anyone, and are incredibly supportive of their respective careers.'They are both massively proud and excited about this relationship and, unlike Taylor's last one \u2014 which was very much kept out of the spotlight, deliberately \u2014 she wants to 'own' this romance, and not hide it away.'Taylor just wants to live her life, and be happy. She's told pals Matty is flying to Nashville over the weekend to support her on the next leg of her tour.'",
        "DailyMail.com contacted representatives for Taylor for comment.Back in 2015, Matt denied romance rumours with Taylor but confirmed they had been texting each other frequently.After rumours began circling he confirmed on Australian radio: 'It's fake. It's all bloody fake. It's a farce!'Yeah, we met each other, we exchanged numbers in the same way that a lot of people in this kind of world do and we spoke occasionally.'And she's the biggest pop star in the world and I'm in Australia. There's no like, relationship or anything happening. It's just funny how people really, really buy into that.'"
