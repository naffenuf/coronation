        "Beyonce's Renaissance World Tour could outearn Taylor Swift's phenomenally successful Eras Tour by a whopping $600million, Forbes\u00a0has revealed.",
        "The Crazy In Love hitmaker, 41, will begin her first solo tour in seven years on May 10 at Stockholm's Friends Arena - with the star set to do battle with 33-year-old Swift's 52 date concert tour, which broke Ticketmaster records with single day sales of two million.However, Queen Bey's 41 date tour, which ends in North America in September, could gross between\u00a0$275 million and $2.57 billion from tickets alone - which smashes The Eras Tour's $1.9billion projection.Therefore, billionaire Beyonce could make nearly $2.2 billion from the tour, $600million more than the\u00a0$1.6 billion Swift could earn,The estimates are based on projected high numbers of fans buying tickets and high average ticket prices of around $700, the publication reports.\u00a0",
        "VIP packages for the tour range from $3757 to $5000.\u00a0The estimate is also based on artists raking in a huge share of merchandise proceeds, leaving them with 80 per cent of tour revenues, minus expensesBeyonce released Renaissance, her seventh studio album containing the hit track Break My Soul, in July 2022.The album won the Grammy for Best Dance/Electronic Album in February.Beyonc\u00e9's last solo tour was the Formation World Tour in 2016\u00a0to support her sixth album, Lemonade - in 2018\u00a0she went on the On The Run Tour with her husband, Jay-Z.",
        "As with previous tours, Beyonc\u00e9 will make her mark offstage, too, with BeyGOOD, the initiative she founded in 2013 to support people and programs around the world.In various cities throughout the tour, BeyGOOD will support entrepreneurs through Black Parade Route luncheons, celebrating small business owners, with grant opportunities being awarded and a foray of services with global partners to promote business sustainability.One thousand small businesses will be supported with a commitment, while BeyGOOD will also support students through scholarship funds that will be given to colleges and universities in ten different cities along the tour.",
        "Each school will be given one hundred thousand dollars and will select the student recipients.BeyGOOD\u2019s total scholarship commitment during RENAISSANCE WORLD TOUR will be one million dollars.The world tour comes after Beyonc\u00e9 returned to the stage with a grand performance in Dubai, marking her first concert in four years.",

        "The musical icon was taking to the stage to celebrate the opening of new luxury hotel Atlantis The Royal, which managed to draw out a bevy of international stars.Despite the high profile of the event, the hitmaker tried to tamp down on the publicity by banning recording and forcing attendees to lock up their phones ahead of the show.Still, a few intrepid attendees managed to keep their cameras free and shared videos of Beyonc\u00e9 belting out her hits, including Halo.She was reportedly paid $24 million for the performance at the luxury resort for the invitation only concert, according to TMZ.The Dubai concert is Beyonce's first live performance since appearing at a Tribute to the late Kobe Bryant and his daughter, Gianna, in 2020.Her rendition of Be Alive from the film King Richard at the 2022 Oscars ceremonies was taped.Fans had been hoping that the long-awaited release of Renaissance meant a tour would be on the cards.There's also potential for some very special guests to join her.In putting the album together, she enlisted the help of such artists as Drake, Pharrell Williams, The-Dream, Skrillex - and none other than her own husband Jay-Z.The dance-heavy album features 16 tracks, including the previously released single Break My Soul, which dropped last month.",
        "The other 15 other tracks are: I'm That Girl, Cozy, Alien Superstar, Cuff It, Energy, Church Girl, Plastic Off the Sofa, Virgo's Groove, Move, Heated, Thique, All Up in Your Mind, America Has a Problem, Pure/Honey and Summer Renaissance.There could be potential for more shows down the line as Beyonce previously described the album as a 'three-act project.'In her note, she re-stated the album's creative process took three years and detailed working throughout the pandemic, calling it a 'time to be still, but also a time I found to be the most creative.'She went on to say: 'Creating this album allowed me a place to dream and to find escape during a scary time for the world.'It allowed me to feel free and adventurous in a time when little else was moving.'My intention was to create a safe place, a place without judgment, a place to be free of perfectionism and overthinking.'A place to scream, release, feel freedom. It was a beautiful journey of exploration.'Renaissance debuted in the top spot on the Billboard 200 albums chart, marking the best-selling week from a female artist this year, and second best-selling of the year.It sold 332,000 equivalent album units in the week through August 4, Billboard reported, citing stats from Luminate.",
        "The album was the first from a female artist to land atop the Billboard 200 this year, as the last female artist to achieve the feat was Adele with her album 40 last December.The record went on to top the charts for its first six weeks, from December 4, 2021 thru January 8, 2022.Renaissance is Beyonce's first solo studio album since her groundbreaking visual album Lemonade from 2016, in which she famously confronted the questions around her marriage to Jay-Z and his fidelity.Beyonce and Jay-Z have been married since 2008 and have welcomed three children into the world - Blue Ivy, 10, and twins Sir and Rumi, five.Beyonce has released four albums since 2016's Lemonade, although none of them were solo studio efforts.In 2018, she dropped Everything Is Love, with Jay-Z under the name the Carters.In April of 2019, she released Homecoming, an album accompanying her 2018 headlining performance at Coachella.That summer she followed with The Lion King: The Gift, a companion album to the Disney film that featured several new Beyonce songs (a deluxe edition of that album featuring three additional tracks was released a year later)."
