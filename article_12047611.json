        "Humza Yousaf has said he hopes spending on the King\u2019s coronation can be kept to a minimum, as he vowed to represent all Scots at the \u201chistoric\u201d event.",
        "While the SNP leader believes an independent Scotland should be a republic rather than a kingdom, Mr Yousaf said it is his duty as First Minister to represent those who think otherwise.He will be pledging the oath to the King during the ceremony, as he and his wife Nadia El-Nakla travel to Westminster Abbey.Mr Yousaf will be wearing a kilt and a designer jacket at the coronation, reflecting his Scottish and Pakistani heritage.",
        "He told the PA news agency: \u201cIt\u2019s a historic moment. I think we can all recognise that.\u201dReflecting on his own views on the monarchy, Mr Yousaf said: \u201cIt\u2019s no great surprise what my views are.\u201cBut also I\u2019ve said very clearly, the job of First Minister is to represent everybody in Scotland \u2013 the office of First Minister requires that.\u201dSome predictions suggest Operation Golden Orb \u2013 the crowning of Charles and the Queen Consort \u2013 could cost the UK between \u00a350 million to \u00a3100 million.Asked about the spending on the event, the First Minister said: \u201cThe fact that we do have a monarchy means that there\u2019s got to be a coronation, there\u2019s going to be money spent on it.\u201cI hope that money really gets kept to a minimum.\u201cMy focus up here in Scotland is making sure every penny we spend in the Scottish Government is focused towards reducing poverty.\u201d",
        "A number of events will be taking place in Scotland over the weekend for those who wish to follow the coronation, though Mr Yousaf added \u201cthere\u2019ll be people there who won\u2019t be watching at all\u201d.The transition from a kingdom to a republic would not be an \u201cimmediate\u201d priority for an independent Scotland, he said, though the SNP would first have to discuss the issue within the party.Mr Yousaf said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got a number of other issues, as you have reported on well, over the last few weeks that the SNP has to confront, so I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll happen in time.\u201cBut the immediate focus for the SNP is to make sure that we get our governance and transparency review not just under way \u2013 which it is \u2013 but making progress.\u201d"
