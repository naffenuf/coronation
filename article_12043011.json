        "Astronomers have spotted a star devouring a planet in a possible preview of the ultimate fate of Earth.",
        "As a star runs out of fuel, it will billow out to a million times its original size, engulfing any matter \u2013 and planets \u2013 in its wake.While scientists have observed hints of stars just before, and shortly after, the act of consuming entire planets, they have never seen one in the act until now.In the new study scientists at MIT, Harvard University, Caltech and elsewhere report that they have observed a star swallowing a planet, for the first time. We are seeing the future of the Earth  Kishalay De, MIT Kavli Institute  The event appears to have taken place in our own galaxy, some 12,000 light-years away, near the eagle-like constellation Aquila.Astronomers spotted an outburst from a star that became more than 100 times brighter over just 10 days, before quickly fading away.",
        "This white-hot flash was followed by a colder, longer-lasting signal, according to the research published in Nature.Only one event \u2013 a star engulfing a nearby planet \u2013 could have produced this combination, the scientists suggest.Lead author Kishalay De, a postdoc in MIT\u2019s Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research, said: \u201cWe were seeing the end stage of the swallowing.\u201dExperts suggest Earth will meet a similar end to this planet, but not for another five billion years, when the sun is expected to burn out, and burn up the solar system\u2019s inner planets.",
        "Dr De said: \u201cWe are seeing the future of the Earth.\u201cIf some other civilisation was observing us from 10,000 light-years away while the sun was engulfing the Earth, they would see the sun suddenly brighten as it ejects some material, then form dust around it, before settling back to what it was.\u201dThe planet observed in the new research is estimated to have been a hot, Jupiter-sized world that spiralled close, then was pulled into the dying star\u2019s atmosphere, and, finally, into its core.The outburst was discovered in May 2020, but it took another year for the astronomers to piece together an explanation for what the outburst could be.The initial signal showed up in a search of data taken by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), run at Caltech\u2019s Palomar Observatory in California.The ZTF scans the sky for stars that rapidly change in brightness, the pattern of which could be signatures of supernovae, gamma-ray bursts and other stellar phenomena.Dr De said: \u201cOne night I noticed a star that brightened by a factor of 100 over the course of a week, out of nowhere.\u201cIt was unlike any stellar outburst I had seen in my life.\u201dHe added: \u201cFor decades we\u2019ve been able to see the before and after \u2013 before, when the planets are still orbiting very close to their star, and after, when a planet has already been engulfed, and the star is giant.",
        "\u201cWhat we were missing was catching the star in the act, where you have a planet undergoing this fate in real time. That\u2019s what makes this discovery really exciting.\u201dAstronomers observed the first direct evidence of a dying star expanding to engulf one of its planets using the power of the Gemini South Adaptive Optics Imager (GSAOI) on the Gemini South telescope in Chile, one half of the International Gemini Observatory, operated by the National Science Foundation\u2019s NOIRLab.This research was supported, in part, by Nasa, the US National Science Foundation and the Heising-Simons Foundation."
