        "The King will find the Homage of the People \u201cabhorrent\u201d, according to his friend, broadcaster Jonathan Dimbleby.",
        "Dimbleby got to know Charles after writing his official biography in the 1990s and said his \u201cthespian\u201d side means he has been closely involved in the performance side of the coronation.But the presenter branded the invitation to the public to swear allegiance to the King during the coronation ceremony \u201cill advised\u201d.",
        "The writer told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cI can think of nothing that he would find more abhorrent.\u201cHe\u2019s never wanted to be revered, he\u2019s never wanted \u2013 so as far as I know \u2013 to have anyone pay homage to him except in mock terms as a joke.\u201cHe wants, I think, to feel that people will share in the event and I don\u2019t quite know how this might have happened.\u201cI don\u2019t know for certain but it would seem to me that this was an initiative by the archbishop, who as we know is strongly evangelical, who thought it would be a good thing to give everyone a chance to pay that homage.\u201cI think it was well intentioned and rather ill-advised.\u201d",
        "Lambeth Palace last week announced the modern addition to the ceremony, which replaces the Homage of the Peers, but said the liturgy \u2013 the words and actions of the service \u2013 had been created in consultation with the King, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby and the Government.",
        "Critics have condemned the move, with the pressure group Republic describing the new homage as \u201coffensive, tone deaf and a gesture that holds the people in contempt\u201d.Lambeth Palace has stressed it is an invitation rather than a request.\u201cWe live in a wonderfully diverse society with many different perspectives and beliefs, and it\u2019s quite right that people decide for themselves how they relate to this moment,\u201d a spokesman for the archbishop\u2019s office said.In 1994, Charles confessed to Dimbleby \u2013 during a primetime television documentary accompanying the biography \u2013 to adultery, saying it only happened after his marriage to Diana, Princess of Wales had \u201cirretrievably broken down\u201d.",
        "Dimbleby, giving an insight into the King\u2019s personality, described him as a \u201cperfectionist\u201d.He added: \u201cIf there were a Mastermind on the histories of coronations he would definitely have it as his special subject and he would emerge triumphant. He knows his history. He believes therefore it\u2019s got to be done really well.\u201dCharles has been \u201cclosely involved\u201d with the performance of the coronation, Dimbleby said, referring to the King\u2019s interest in the theatre and acting.\u201cThere is an element of performative in him. He is a thespian, he loves the theatre, so he wants it all to work really well,\u201d he added.",
        "The King also wanted to be personally involved in choosing clothes to reflect his role as a \u201chumble petitioner\u201d, Dimbleby revealed.",
        "He said: \u201cHe wanted to make sure that his clothes, for instance, made it possible for him initially to be what the role is, almost seeking the approval of the nation to become King, almost a humble petitioner, and then to emerge triumphant of this extraordinary pageant, of which he is the star.\u201dAs King, Charles will focus on diversity and harmony in the country, leading as a \u201cmonarch for our times\u201d, Dimbleby said.\u201cHe sees his role, I think \u2013 I have talked about it with him \u2013 as being doing his best to achieve a sense of overarching harmony in a very diverse and often rather troubled, very troubled, often divided United Kingdom.\u201cThat\u2019s what will be his lodestar, his guiding sense of duty.\u201dDimbleby added that Charles understands he can no longer share political views as King and in public will \u201conly speak when he knows that he is expressing a consensus as defined by the government of the day\u201d.\u201cHe will honour the customs and he will be very much a monarch for our times because he is a 21st century person,\u201d he said."
