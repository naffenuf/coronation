        "Vaping products are being \u201cillicitly traded\u201d in school playgrounds, MPs have heard, amid fears the devices are a \u201cpublic health ticking time bomb\u201d for youngsters.",
        "Conservative MP Neil Hudson (Penrith and The Border) suggested the products could be hidden from view in shops to stop the \u201cappealing, colourful, fruit-flavoured\u201d choices appearing \u201clike sweeties on shelves\u201d.His remarks came as he pressed the Government to take further action to discourage vape usage among under-18s.Ministers last month pledged a crackdown on the illegal sale of e-cigarettes to under-18s with an \u201cillicit vapes enforcement squad\u201d.",
        "They are also seeking to identify other ways to reduce the number of children using the products, which allow people to inhale nicotine in a vapour rather than smoke.Speaking in Parliament, Mr Hudson highlighted reports of children having their sleep patterns disrupted.He told MPs: \u201cSetting their alarms for two or three in the morning so they can vape in the middle of the night to avoid withdrawal symptoms the next day.\u201cAt school there have been reports of students leaving lessons and even walking out of examinations because they simply cannot last without the use of a vape.\u201cIf vaping is having detrimental impacts on the life chances of our young children this is not merely a matter of health but one of social and educational development.\u201cOne teacher in my constituency even noted that so widespread is the issue that vapes are being illicitly traded in the school playground.\u201d",
        "Mr Hudson said there is also \u201cflagrant targeting\u201d of under-18s by advertising, including on social media.Pressed on what more the Government should be doing to prevent children from vaping, Mr Hudson replied: \u201cCalling for evidence and having a taskforce is a good starting post, but I think we need to do more. Our message is very clear: vapes should not be used by people under the age of 18 or by non-smokers  Neil O'Brien, health minister  \u201cI think we really need to tackle the advertising, making sure that the labelling is sufficient.\u201dHe pointed to \u201cquite alarming\u201d health warnings on cigarette packaging, adding: \u201cThey are behind closed cabinets in outlets as well. I think we need to be moving in that direction so that these are not like sweeties on shelves for our young kids.\u201cI think that is the real issue. These are appealing, colourful, fruit-flavoured products that people think, \u2018You know what, I want to have a try of this\u2019 and that is where people are slipping into this problem.\u201cI fear that we have a public health ticking time bomb for our young people that we must as a parliament and a society address as a priority.\u201dHealth minister Neil O\u2019Brien said there has been a \u201csurge\u201d in the use and promotion of \u201ccheap, colourful\u201d vaping products in the last 18 months.",
        "He said: \u201cWe know that vapes are not risk-free. Nicotine is highly addictive and it can be harmful and there are unanswered questions about the effect in the longer-term use.\u201cOur message is very clear: vapes should not be used by people under the age of 18 or by non-smokers.\u201d"
