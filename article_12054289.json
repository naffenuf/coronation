        "Did you know that heart disease is the number one killer of women in the United States? Unfortunately, it\u2019s not something that everyone thinks about proactively \u2014 but taking measures to support your heart could change your life for the better.That begins with a healthy diet, regular exercise, and key supplements formulated with your heart\u2019s needs in mind. At the top of that list is Eu Natural Heart Defend-Her. It\u2019s an excellent value at $14.99, but DailyMail.com readers are eligible to receive an extra 20% off with code EUHEART20.  Eu Natural Heart Defend-Her\u00a0 Put your heart health first! Formulated to benefit women's cardiovascular health, this potent supplement contains grape seed extract, CoQ10, magnesium, vitamin D, and vitamin K2.Used regularly, the vegetarian vitamin can support healthy blood pressure levels, promote better vascular elasticity, and potentially even reduce stress levels.Just two capsules per day is all that you need to give your heart the attention that it deserves. $14.99 (save 20%)\u00a0 ShopSpecifically, there are three key risk factors that impact a woman\u2019s likelihood of developing heart disease in her lifetime. This supplement is formulated to target each one with a blend of potent, clinical-strength ingredients proven to make a difference when taken regularly.Among those ingredients are grape seed extract, which has been found in studies to lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure by a significant percentage.",
        "Another key addition to Eu Natural Heart Defend-Her is coenzyme Q10, more commonly known as CoQ10. This potent antioxidant exists naturally in the body, and it plays a vital role in supporting energy levels, reducing free radical damage, and potentially reducing blood pressure.Studies have also found that CoQ10 could reduce the risk of fatality due to heart failure, minimize the risk of having a second heart attack, and even improve symptoms of congestive heart failure.All of these are incredibly important benefits for anyone who has heart health concerns \u2014 but just as much for the average person who simply wants to take preventative measures to protect their heart.What\u2019s significant about Eu Natural Heart Defend-Her is that it may also support the elasticity of the arteries, another critical factor that can protect your heart in the long run. Everything from regular cardio exercise to gentle yoga sessions can make a difference.",
        "However, it\u2019s just as important to add vitamins D and K to your routine \u2014 both of which are found in this heart-friendly vitamin. The formula even contains magnesium, which can help you manage your stress more effectively.That\u2019s equally important, as stress can take its toll on the body \u2014 and consequently your heart \u2014 in so many ways that go undetected for years and years. By implementing protective measures now, you could be doing your heart an incredible favor.",
        "Even without the discounted price, it\u2019s obvious that your health is worth every penny \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t hurt that Eu Natural Heart Defend-Her has a fantastic price point that is easily accessible and just as easy to incorporate into your wellness routine."
