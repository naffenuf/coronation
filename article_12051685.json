        "The Greens have won their first outright majority on a UK council in what it hopes cements a \u201ccoming of age\u201d moment as a mainstream party.",
        "Mid Suffolk fell from a minority Conservative administration to sole control of the Greens as they made inroads elsewhere during the local election results on Friday.The left-wing environmentalists have controlled local authorities in minority and coalition administrations before, but this is the first time they will have outright control.With eight more results to be declared, the Greens\u2019 victory was declared when they won 18 of the East Anglia council\u2019s 34 seats.Green Party co-leader Adrian Ramsay told the PA news agency: \u201cFor the first time anywhere outside Australia we\u2019ve seen the Greens take the majority control of a council.\u201cIt\u2019s enormous because what we\u2019ve seen over the last four sets of election since 2019 is the Green party really coming of age as a mainstream party in this country.\u201d",
        "Mr Ramsay said the Greens have been part of around 20 local administrations in the past but capturing overall control is a \u201creally significant\u201d moment that \u201cpaves the way for success at the general election.\u201dHe said his party is picking votes from both Labour and the Conservatives across rural and urban areas.Caroline Lucas has been the party\u2019s sole MP, but Mr Ramsay hopes to enter the Commons in the new Waveney Valley constituency, which includes much of Mid Suffolk.",
        "Carla Denyer, who shares the Green leadership, plans to run in Bristol Central, where she will change strong Labour support.But doing so would edge out another left-wing candidate, putting at risk Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s chances of winning a general election.Mr Ramsay said: \u201cGetting more greens elected will hold other parties\u2019 feet to the fire and will raise the issues that need to be challenged in terms of the climate emergency but also cost of living and growing inequality.\u201dThe Greens were also behind the Conservatives losing overall control of East Hertfordshire, where no party won a majority. Seventeen Green candidates won spots on the council on Thursday\u2019s votes.In Mid Suffolk, Mr Ramsay vowed to be responsive to local concerns and focus on housing which is currently \u201cfar too expensive for local people and outside their reach\u201d.He said the Green-run council plans to advocate for more social housing and being tougher with developers on affordable housing."
