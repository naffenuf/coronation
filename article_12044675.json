        "When asked who was better in bed, Paltrow admitted, 'That's really hard. Because Brad was like the major chemistry love of your life at the time. And then Ben was like technically excellent.'When asked which was a better actor, Paltrow said, 'They're both so talented. And Ben is a great writer and director.\u00a0But I guess I would probably have to say acting alone, Brad. Because if you think of all the different roles that he's done.'",
        "Pitt's new film Wolves follows two lone wolf fixers - played by Pitt and George Clooney - whose lives are upended when they are assigned the same job.It was revealed last year that both Pitt and Clooney, who are also serving as producers, both took pay cuts to ensure the film would also get a theatrical release along with its debut on Apple TV Plus.'It was an exciting time because it got to be one of those weird bidding wars which happen every once in a while, and it ended up being pretty extreme, and Apple came in with a really big number for Brad and I,' Clooney told Deadline last year.'And we said we\u2019d like to take less as long as we can guarantee that we can have a theatrical release, and they said great,' Clooney, 61, added, in a reference to Apple.\u00a0"
