We've seen it from set pieces.'",
        "Alexander-Arnold\u00a0almost got yet another assist against the Bees in the first half after delivering a superb cross into the box, but Darwin Nunez was unable to make full use of it.\u00a0The England international has drawn criticism in recent years for a number of defensive mishaps, which have cost Liverpool dearly on several occasions.There is no disputing the 24-year-old's quality going forward, however, given he has already produced 53 assists in just 194 league outings for the Reds.Alexander-Arnold has displayed his quality going forward since moving into the inverted role against Arsenal last month.\u00a0",
        "He has the most assists, chances created, passes in the opposition's half, penalty area entries, possession won and touches in the Premier League since the 2-2 draw with the Gunners.\u00a0Alexander-Arnold recently revealed the mood at Liverpool remains low despite their recent upturn in form boosting hopes of European football next season.The 1-0 win over Brentford has put Jurgen Klopp's side a point behind fourth-placed Manchester United having played two games more.\u00a0\u00a0"
