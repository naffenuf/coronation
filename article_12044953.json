        "May 4 (Reuters) - Prices of most base metals rose on Thursday, as a weaker dollar made greenback-priced metals more expensive to holders of other currencies.",
        "Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange advanced 1.7% to $8,609.50 a tonne by 0235 GMT, while the most-traded June copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange increased 0.4% to 67,160 yuan ($9,738.98) a tonne.The dollar slipped against most major currencies after the U.S. Federal Reserve opened the door to a pause in its aggressive tightening cycle, though markets were buffeted by risk aversion amid a rout in regional U.S. bank shares.LME aluminium rose 0.6% to $2,334.50 a tonne, nickel increased 0.6% to $24,900 a tonne, zinc climbed 0.8% to $2,650 a tonne, lead was up 0.1% at $2,133 a tonne while tin fell 0.8% to $26,560 a tonne.SHFE aluminium increased 0.3% to 18,495 yuan a tonne, nickel jumped 3.6% to 188,660 yuan a tonne, tin leaped 1.2% to 211,860 yuan a tonne, zinc advanced 0.6% to 21,320 yuan a tonne and lead was up 0.7% at 15,360 yuan a tonne.Nickel inventories in SHFE warehouses &amp;lt;NI-STX-SGH&gt; fell to a record low of 1,426 tonnes on Friday, causing the premium of the SHFE front-month nickel contract over the third month contract to rise.For the top stories in metals and other news, click orDATA/EVENTS (GMT)0750 France S&amp;amp;P Global Serv, Comp PMIs April0755 Germany S&amp;amp;P Global Serv PMI April",
