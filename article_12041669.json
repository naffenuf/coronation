        "However, one of Battersea Dogs and Cats Home's staff members has revealed that many of Paul's scenes 'won't see the light of the day.'Speaking on Thursday's episode of Lorraine, he explained: 'Anyone who knows Paul would acknowledge that probably half of what we filmed was unbroadcastable and will probably never see the light of day.'Recalling one memory, he said: 'This morning I remembered [when we were filming with a bulldog].'I think we were doing a wound check. He'd taken a shine to Paul and over the next ten minutes literally pulled Paul from one side of the kennel to the other and back again.'At the end of the ten minutes, [Paul] was covered in fur and drool, and we realised we'd been filming the wrong dog. Lots of little memories like that.'Paul O'Grady: For the Love of Dogs airs Thursday evenings on ITV1."
