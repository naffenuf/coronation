        "A renowned micro-sculptor has created a tiny crown fitted inside the eye of a needle to mark the coronation of the King and Queen Consort.",
        "Dr Willard Wigan hand-wove a 24-carat gold frame around a carved grain of sand to make the body of the piece, encrusting it with real jewels and painting the piece with a brush made from his own eyelash.In all, he invested 600 hours of work across seven weeks. It drove me mad to make this  Dr Willard Wigan  Dr Wigan, from south Birmingham, has previously created similar models including one of the Queen\u2019s Coronation Carriage \u2013\u00a0also fitted inside the eye of a needle \u2013 to mark her Platinum Jubilee last year.He used a microscope to create the crown, employing a special breathing technique and working mostly through the night and early mornings, when there are fewer vibrations and air disturbances from passing traffic.The piece, made to look like St Edward\u2019s Crown \u2013 which will be placed on Charles\u2019s head during the Westminster Abbey ceremony on Saturday \u2013 is mounted within the eye of a sewing needle and is not much bigger than a full-stop in standard newsprint.Dr Wigan was honoured with an MBE for services to art in 2007.",
        "\u201cIt drove me mad to make this,\u201d he said.\u201cWhen my work is finished, it doesn\u2019t belong to me any more, this crown is for people to see. It\u2019s one of the hardest and most detailed sculptures I\u2019ve ever undertaken to date.\u201d",
        "He plans to exhibit the crown rather than give it to the King, as a gift for all people to see and enjoy."
