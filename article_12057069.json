        "Michael Beale described Rangers as the \u201cmost wasteful team\u201d he has ever seen after Sunday\u2019s 1-0 home win over Aberdeen.",
        "On the day that Celtic retained the cinch Premiership\u00a0title with a 2-0 win over Hearts at Tynecastle, midfielder Todd Cantwell gave the Ibrox fans something to cheer about in the 65th minute with his fine volley from a James Tavernier corner.Rangers had an experimental look to their side, partly due to injuries, but the Gers boss returned to a familiar theme as he bemoaned missed chances throughout the game.\u201cWe had some good moments with the ball all day,\u201d said the former QPR boss, who revealed defender Ben Davies came off with a hamstring problem which could make him a doubt for next week\u2019s game against Celtic.\u201cSometimes I feel that we are the most wasteful team in the final third that I have ever seen. We created unbelievable chances and didn\u2019t take them.\u201cWe suddenly face two 80-yard dashes to our own goal. On another day we could find ourselves behind.",
        "\u201cIn the first 15 minutes of the second half we missed more unbelievable chances, and when the balls hit the bar I thought it wasn\u2019t going to be our day.\u201cI know it was their player who got the last touch (when Aberdeen captain Jonny Hayes inadvertently smashed a Rabbi Matondo cut-back against his own crossbar) but we have two or three players there.",
        "\u201cIt is not unlucky when we are missing these chances. After a while it has to be poor play or poor final pass, movement, decision-making.\u201cIt has happened in every single day since I came back to the club \u2013 we have missed incredible chances.\u201dAsked if the current squad could provide answers or if new attackers were required, Beale appeared unhappy with the contribution of substitute Alfredo Morelos, who is leaving at the end of the season.The Colombia striker came off the bench with Scott Arfield, Glen Kamara and Scott Wright just after Cantwell\u2019s goal.Beale said: \u201cI think you saw a difference when Alfredo came on in terms of energy but not a positive difference as well.\u201cI think we will need a focal point for the team, for sure.\u201cAntonio Colak is not fit at the moment and Alfredo is obviously going to be moving on.\u201cFashion (Sakala) and Rabbi (Matondo) gave us a different type of front line and it was also nice to see Ianis Hagi get some minutes.\u201cThroughout the game we had some passages of really good play but we have to be more decisive if we want to feel at ease at the end of the game.\u201dIt was a first defeat in eight for Aberdeen, who remain in third place, five points ahead of Hearts.",
        "Manager Barry Robson\u00a0revealed that Ross McCrorie, twin brother of Rangers goalkeeper Robby, missed the game with a hernia injury, saying: \u201cHe had surgery, we hope to have him back pretty quick.\u201dRobson was also unhappy with his side\u2019s finishing, especially the two chances Luis \u2018Duk\u2019 Lopes\u00a0 missed in the first half \u2013 a shot saved by McCrorie before he chipped the ball over the bar when again he only had the Gers keeper to beat.He said: \u201cFirst half we should have scored a couple of goals. We had two brilliant chances to get a couple of goals up on Rangers.\u201cYou need to take them wherever you are, not just coming here. But it\u2019s probably more important to take them here.\u201cYou have those two unbelievable chances in the first half \u2013 they don\u2019t come much better than one-on-one chances.\u201dRobson also complained about a first-half incident when Gers defender Connor Goldson tangled with Duk at the edge of the box, with referee John Beaton awarding only a corner.He said: \u201cAnd then obviously the first half, is it a penalty or a free-kick outside as well? I don\u2019t know.\u201cIt was one or the other. Where was VAR? Anyone see it? Where was it? I don\u2019t know. Was it in the building today? I am being serious.\u201d"
