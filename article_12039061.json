It just wouldn\u2019t work with anybody else, would it?",
        "\u201cWhen these guys came in we knew something special was going to happen, and it has.\u201dThousands of Wrexham fans of all ages lined the streets, chanting and waving flags and scarves, as the three buses made their way through the city\u00a0on a loop that started and finished outside the Racecourse Ground, cutting through a fog of red smoke from the ubiquitous flares.But it was not just locals celebrating, with some US fans making the trip to Wales to share in the victory celebrations.",

        "Both were pictured beside the women\u2019s team on the second of the three buses on Tuesday.The pair previously said there was \u201cseriousness\u201d to their offer, broadcast on Twitter, for Gareth Bale to come out of retirement and play for Wrexham after the team\u2019s promotion.The former Wales captain announced his retirement at the age of 33 in January after leading Wales to their first World Cup finals appearance since 1958.Reynolds also said bringing the trophy home was \u201cprobably at least the top one experiences of my life\u201d and that he is now \u201cemotionally connected\u201d to every single player in the club.",
        "\u201cI don\u2019t know that I\u2019ll ever be quite the same again,\u201d he said, during an interview with S4C on Tuesday.\u201cI live in a sort of constant, slightly perpetual state of elation and I don\u2019t want to come back down from this cloud.\u201cI realise that this isn\u2019t a sport for the soft-hearted, but to experience that moment and to bring that trophy home to Wrexham was probably at least the top one experiences of my life.\u201d\u201cAnd I am aware that I have children,\u201d he joked."
