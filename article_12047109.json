        "Leicester boss Dean Smith hopes Jamie Vardy can fire his side to Premier League safety after the veteran\u2019s recent revival.",
        "Vardy has scored in the last two games to help move the Foxes out of the bottom three having previously gone 19 games without a goal.Smith, who is on a short-term SOS mission at the King Power Stadium to keep Leicester up, says the 36-year-old is \u201cfiring\u201d ahead of the crunch run-in.\u201cPeople will have seen in his last few performances the hunger and desire he has got, the work rate, the fact his legs are still there and his brains are definitely still there,\u201d Smith said ahead of Monday\u2019s trip to Fulham.\u201cWe are really pleased that he is back scoring goals for us. He has got his first away goal at Leeds and his first home one on Monday (against Everton), we are really pleased he is in a good place at the moment.\u201cHe knows as well as anyone as a striker with his record he will be judged on goals. He probably hasn\u2019t had the pitch time to earn the goals or chances but he has created a penalty for us against Wolves. He has come on and scored against Leeds and scored a goal on Monday.",
        "\u201cHe is in a good vein of form at the moment, which is what we need with only four games to go.",
        "\u201cI don\u2019t think we have had to rebuild his confidence, we have had to play more to his strengths. We know he is an intelligent player with his runs, but he needs the ball to go into the right areas with his runs.\u201cWe have to have a supply line to him and he has to make the runs as well.\u201dLeicester could have Ricardo Pereira back after a hamstring injury, while there is also good news over Kelechi Iheancho (groin) and Jonny Evans (virus).\u201cRicky Pereira has been training with us, he has only been doing part of the session,\u201d Smith said.\u201cHe will be training with us on Saturday and Sunday so that will be a boost to the squad to have him.\u201cRicky is due to train with us on Saturday. He part trained yesterday and if he came through Saturday, I am sure he would put himself forward for selection on Monday.\u201cKels has responded to the treatment so won\u2019t be back for Monday, but we may get him back for the last two games which we weren\u2019t hopeful of when he first sustained the injury.\u201cJonny is back training. He has trained the last couple of days and trained really well, so it is nice to get that experienced head around.",
        "\u201cEven just to have him on the training ground, there is so much the other lads can pick up from him with his knowledge and his experience. It\u2019s great to have him back.\u201d"
