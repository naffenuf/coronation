        "Marco Silva vowed Fulham would do everything they could to match their best-ever Premier League points tally with just four opportunities left to meet the objective.",
        "Fulham last hit 53 points in 2008-09 under Roy Hodgson, ultimately finishing seventh that campaign.Silva\u2019s 10th-placed Cottagers are still eight points away from repeating that feat and have their next opportunity to move closer when they host relegation-threatened Leicester on Monday.\u201cWe are going to fight for it,\u201d said Silva. \u201cWe are going to fight because it\u2019s a target for us, clearly it\u2019s a target for us. We have 12 points to fight for and we are going to do our best.\u201cAs always, game by game, thinking the next one will be a very good one at home at the Cottage that we want to do our best and we are going to do our best to win.\u201cIt\u2019s there, the target is there but realistically we are going to have to fight really hard to get it.\u201dSilva\u2019s side are hoping to bounce back from three-consecutive losses, including Wednesday night\u2019s Liverpool encounter decided by Mohamed Salah\u2019s 39th-minute penalty \u2013 awarded following a VAR decision the Fulham boss reiterated should not have gone the Reds\u2019 way.He said: \u201cLiverpool clearly didn\u2019t deserve the result. It was a clear mistake that made us to lose the match and that penalty that I repeat is embarrassing, that decision and of course it\u2019s up to us to react, to go again and to do our best to take the three points.\u201d",
        "Fulham\u2019s second-most recent loss was at the hands of surging table-toppers Manchester City,\u00a0who presented a very different challenge from the one expected from the 16th-placed Foxes on Monday.Silva will be without midfielder Andreas Pereira and skipper Tim Ream, who were both ruled out for the rest of the season following injuries sustained in the City clash.Dean Smith\u2019s men are outside the drop zone on goal difference alone and Silva expects their precarious position to be a dangerous motivator come the Bank Holiday.",
        "He added: \u201cProbably the next game against Leicester will probably be even more difficult than against City and Liverpool.\u201cPeople probably don\u2019t understand what I\u2019m saying. I\u2019m not saying that Leicester is a better team than the other two, that\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying, but they\u2019re fighting for their lives.\u201cThey come to play in a different way than the other two teams against us and of course, it will be a tough one, a good test, another one for us at the Cottage with our fans and of course we have to play as best as we can to win the game.\u201d"
