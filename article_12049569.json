        "The 32-year-old reality star - who was previously engaged to film producer Randall Emmett - revealed to The Hollywood Reporter on Thursday that she was backing out of attending the 2023 MTV Movie &amp; TV Awards airing on Sunday.Kent's series Vanderpump Rules is nominated for Best Docu-Reality Show and Best Reality On-Screen Team, which she herself is nominated for alongside the show's Ariana Madix, Katie Maloney and Scheana Shay, and Kent was also previously announced as a presenter.The news comes just hours after host Drew Barrymore also bowed out\u00a0to show support for writers, with the show still moving forward as planned, though sans host.After Barrymore's departure, Kent is the first star to back out of the show, though it remains to be seen how many others will follow.",
        "'I am so honored to be nominated this year and thankful to all my fans who have been voting but I have decided to stay home in support of the many hard working writers who deserve to be compensated fairly,' Kent said in a statement to THR.'Although Vanderpump Rules falls under the unscripted sector of TV, that is not an excuse for me to remain silent and carry on as if there isn\u2019t so much at stake for every writer and their families,' she added.",
