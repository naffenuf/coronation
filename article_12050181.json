        "Kym Marsh is set to divorce her husband Scott Ratcliff, it was claimed on Thursday after an apparent strike of the 'Strictly Curse', following 18 months of marriage.\u00a0",
        "The former Hear'Say star, 46, is said to have embarked on a 'trial separation' from the Army Major after the stress of their jobs consumed their romance, before finally calling it quits when she was on Strictly and he was placed in the barracks.\u00a0According to The Sun, Kym and Scott decided to end their marriage due to the strain of work, but 'cracks' had been present in the relationship for some.While Kym lives in Cheshire, Scott is based in barracks down south meaning the couple struggled to spend quality time together - and Kym's intense Strictly rehearsals last year reportedly put further strain on the marriage.While the split may come as a shock to some, over the past year Kym has touched on the strains of her personal life, including the realities of being an army wife - branding things 'grim' when her husband is posted away from home.\u00a0",
        "In January last year, she revealed that two days after their wedding in October 2021 he was sent away for a fortnight - something she 'was not expecting' and branded life as an army wife 'pretty grim' due to the distance.\u00a0As well as the stress of their distance, she admitted the danger of his job added to the problem as she was worried about war.\u00a0",
        "She said: 'There is always anxiety, it is always stressful when he goes away. There may not be an actual war threat currently but there's always a risk when you're in these dangerous places.'As well as her assessment of the distance in their lives, she also spoke about how Strictly exacerbated her anxiety - with training falling in line with Scott's time away with the Parachute Regiment - leaving the couple barely seeing one another.\u00a0Speaking to OK! in January 2022, she said: 'It's been really good. Well, I say that, but we got married and then two days later Scott was sent away for two weeks and we weren't expecting that! That was a bit grim, but it's just part of being an army wife...'It felt like on the honeymoon I could properly celebrate being Mrs Ratcliff!'Scott detailed why he had to leave his new wife for work so soon after the wedding, adding: 'I do three terms per year at (military academy) Sandhurst and every term I'll go away for two weeks to run an overseas training exercise.'Aside from her life as an army WAG, she also spoke about how her time on Strictly increased her anxiety - just four months before her split was announced.\u00a0",
        "She said: 'I've always been open about my struggles with anxiety, and there were times on set where it reared its head and threatened to take hold...'I was nervous, but I discovered I could beat it and take control. That's the lesson I'll cherish most. I've realised how far I'm able to push myself and overcome things that I might think I'm too weak to do.'Kym stars in Waterloo Road and is a regular host of BBC1 daytime show Morning Live as well as appearing in theatre roles.\u00a0A source told The Sun:\u00a0'They both really tried to make it work, but the cracks have been there for a while and they were only getting to see each other for one or two days a week at the very most.'They continued: 'They had a trial separation earlier this year and were hoping to get things back on track but they've decided it's best to go their separate ways.",
        "'It's very sad for all involved, but they've decided it's time to tell their family and friends and focus on the future - which means filing for divorce, they're hoping to keep things as amicable as possible. Hopefully time will help to heal things.'MailOnline have contacted Kym's representatives for comment.\u00a0\u00a0",
