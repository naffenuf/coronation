        "MEXICO CITY, May 8 (Reuters) -",
        "The early warning seismic alarm system in Mexico City sounded off on Monday in error during maintenance work, sending panicked residents into the streets in anticipation of an earthquake that turned out to be a false alarm.Reuters witnesses heard the alarm in different parts of the city and saw residents filing out of office and residential buildings, and even a hospital.Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum announced on Twitter that the alarm had been activated, but there were no reports of an actual earthquake and the ground in the megalopolis never actually started shaking.\"Due to an error derived from maintenance work, the seismic alarm was accidentally activated at 851 locations in Mexico City. We apologize for the inconvenience and impact this incident caused,\" the Mexico City government said on Twitter minutes later.Earthquakes frequently rock Mexico City, sometimes with deadly consequences, and the seismic alarm system often gives residents precious seconds to head to a secure area before the shaking starts.
