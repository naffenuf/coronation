        "Frank Lampard believes Chelsea need to become \u201ckillers\u201d in attack in order to build on an overdue victory and begin bridging the sizeable gap to the Premier League\u2019s leading clubs.",
        "The mid-table Blues on Saturday ended a nine-match winless run, including six successive defeats since Lampard was reappointed, by beating Bournemouth 3-1.Conor Gallagher headed the visitors in front at Vitality Stadium but, after Matias Vina\u2019s leveller, they were largely toothless going forward until late finishes from Benoit Badiashile and Joao Felix halted the prolonged slump.While a top-half finish is the extent of Chelsea\u2019s potential this season, they will hope to be challenging for Champions League qualification at the very least next term.Interim manager Lampard, who is due to leave Stamford Bridge in the summer, feels the Blues must develop a ruthless streak in order to do that and suggested the club may need further recruits, despite having already spent more than \u00a3600million on transfers since Todd Boehly\u2019s takeover.\u201cWe controlled a lot of the game,\u201d he said of the south-coast success.\u201cWithout the killer instinct, we were running inside their box a lot in the first half, we had a lot of overloads on the side of the pitch.\u201cAnd as this team develops or as we add to the squad I think you have to be more killers at the top end of the pitch.\u201cIf you look at the top half of the table, that\u2019s what you will see all across it. At the moment, we haven\u2019t got that. But you saw nice individual performances in a positive direction.\u201d",
        "Two-time European champions Chelsea sit in 11th position, a staggering 40 points behind leaders Manchester City and well adrift of the top four.Travelling supporters celebrated the long-awaited triumph with self-deprecating cries of \u2018we are staying up\u2019, having earlier directed derogatory chants at American businessman Boehly.Lampard backed the club\u2019s owners to eventually be successful following a dismal first campaign at the helm.\u201cThe fans have been used to a lot of success, they want a lot of success,\u201d said the former Blues midfielder.\u201cWhat I do know is the fans will stick with this club. I do know there are a lot of intentions to take this club where we want to get it to again. As this team develops or as we add to the squad I think you have to be more killers at the top end of the pitch  Frank Lampard  \u201cThere\u2019s not one club out there of our size that hasn\u2019t had transitional periods.\u201cPeople would give a left arm to have the success we\u2019ve had for 20 years, so if it\u2019s our year where we have to go again and work a bit and try and come back stronger next year, everyone stick together, then I\u2019m sure we will.\u201dThe west London club move on to meetings with relegation-threatened Nottingham Forest, reigning champions City, and Champions League hopefuls Manchester United and Newcastle.",
        "Lampard is concerned left-back Ben Chilwell will be unavailable for the run-in after he limped off against the Cherries.\u201cIt\u2019s a hamstring injury,\u201d he said.\u201cWe don\u2019t know if it\u2019s serious but with a hamstring injury at this stage of the season it\u2019s clearly a worry for the last few games.\u201dBournemouth began the weekend level on 39 points with Chelsea and had the better chances for a winner before suffering late disappointment, with Badiashile\u2019s pivotal strike coming from Hakim Ziyech\u2019s free-kick into the penalty area.The Cherries have the worst record in the division for conceding goals from set-pieces, an issue head coach Gary O\u2019Neil is eager to address.\u201cWe\u2019ve struggled with defending balls into the box,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re obviously aware of it and it\u2019s something we need to improve.\u201cI\u2019m hopeful we can put some work in now week to week but then we can put things in place for next season to make us much stronger in that area.\u201d"
