        "Shaun Maloney was pleased with the way his Wigan players dealt with another \u201chard\u2026difficult\u201d week by ending their Sky Bet Championship campaign with a 0-0 draw against Rotherham.",
        "With the Millers already safe, there was always going to be an end-of-season feel to this dead rubber.Even more so considering the Wigan players had not been paid on time for a fifth time this season, and half of their regular line-up were not named in the squad.Young Wigan goalkeeper Sam Tickle was the star man on his league debut, but neither side looked capable of troubling the scorers on a miserable afternoon at the DW.\u201cI actually really liked the second half,\u201d said Maloney. \u201cWe had to change things slightly at half-time, and I really liked the mentality we had.\u201cThe first half was a little bit tentative. In fairness, some of the players hadn\u2019t played for a while \u2013 or at least alongside each other for a while.",
        "\u201cI just told them I needed a bit more aggression and belief in that second half, at the end of what has been a very, very difficult few days.\u201cAnd there were a number of positives to come out of it, especially the performance of a number of young players.\u201dWhen asked about the off-field situation, Maloney added: \u201cIt\u2019s been hard, very hard.\u201cI think we all expected and hoped that these kinds of days were behind us. But, yes, it was very difficult again for everyone to deal with.",
        "\u201cThere\u2019s just been a lack of clarity, which makes it difficult for me to manage the team and manage the players individually.\u201cAnd I have to say a massive thanks again to the squad, five of whom played despite not having been paid.\u201cThat\u2019s not to discount any of the other players who did exactly the same earlier this season when this happened before.\u201cIt\u2019s just a really special group really, given what they\u2019ve been through.\u201cThey\u2019ve gone above and beyond this year for the club, and people shouldn\u2019t forget that.\u201dFor Rotherham boss Matt Taylor, it was a case of enjoying the day with the job for the season having already been done.\u201cIt was their moment, this, and for the players,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a reward and recognition for what they\u2019ve done over the previous 45 games.\u201cWe did what we set out to do, and we achieved that last Monday. This was a celebration of that.\u201cIn the first half, I quite liked us as a team, and we created enough openings to probably go ahead in the game.\u201cIn the second half, we became a little bit disjointed, along with the game.\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to read too much into that, because we\u2019d already done our work for the season. And it was a great moment at the end for the players, to be able to celebrate with the fans.",
        "\u201cI\u2019ve just been told that\u2019s been our best away following for nine years, and I think that shows the connection between the fans and this group of players \u2013 and it\u2019s all about trust.\u201cI came in a couple of months into the season, and I\u2019ve started to build that trust with them, as they have with me.\u201cThe fans are the same, and they\u2019ll only do that if we achieve our goals \u2013 and this year, that was staying in the league.\u201d"
