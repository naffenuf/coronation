        "West Ham should be boosted by the returns of Declan Rice, Tomas Soucek and Nayef Aguerd for Sunday\u2019s visit of Manchester United.",
        "David Moyes\u2019 first-choice trio were absent for the 3-0 defeat at Manchester City after a sickness bug swept through the Hammers\u2019 camp.All three travelled to Manchester only to be sent home a few hours before kick-off.But Hammers boss Moyes is confident the midfield partnership of Rice and Soucek, along with key centre-half Aguerd, will be available at the weekend.However, Moyes revealed another couple of players have also come down with illness.\u201cThey\u2019ve been in today and done a little bit of training,\u201d said Moyes. \u201cWe are hoping all three will be available for the weekend.",
        "\u201cBut we had one other player who was sent home this morning and another who said he didn\u2019t feel so good.\u201cWe\u2019ve just got to hope we can contain it. It looks like it\u2019s more like sickness and players are getting over it quite quickly.\u201dMoyes will still be without Kurt Zouma, who has an ankle injury, and fellow defender Vladimir Coufal, who tweaked a hamstring at City.The Scot, who turned 60 last week, is juggling the Premier League relegation battle with a Europa Conference League semi-final against AZ Alkmaar, the first leg of which takes place next Thursday.\u201cI\u2019ve always said the Premier League is the priority,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when you are starting to talk about a semi-final in Europe you\u2019re talking about another decision.",
        "\u201cIf we play to our best we will give any team a very good match. If we do that then we will gain the extra points we need.\u201d"
