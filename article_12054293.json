        "Penny Mordaunt has been praised for her conduct during the King\u2019s coronation ceremony, where she held ceremonial swords for more than an hour.",
        "As Lord President of the Council she was responsible for bearing The Sword of State and presenting The Jewelled Sword of Offering to the King \u2013 the first time it has been carried and presented by a woman.Dressed in a custom-made teal outfit with a matching cape and headband with gold feather embroidery, she held and carried the pieces for the majority of the service.",
        "Notable figures including a number of fellow MPs praised her, with Labour MP Emily Thornberry tweeting: \u201cGot to say it, @PennyMordaunt looks damn fine! The sword bearer steals the show. #Coronation.\u201dAuthor and columnist Caitlin Moran also commented on the social media buzz around Ms Mordaunt\u2019s role, saying: \u201cPenny Mordaunt\u2019s sword is the \u201cPippa Middleton\u2019s Bum\u201d of the Coronation.\u201dLabour MP Chris Bryant quipped in a tweet: \u201cThe Penny is mightier than the sword.\u201dFollowing the coronation, Ms Mordaunt said said she was \u201chonoured\u201d to have been part of the event.She said: \u201cI\u2019m very aware that our armed forces, police officers and others have been marching or standing for hours as part of the ceremony or to keep us all safe. In comparison, my job was rather easier.\u201cHuge and heartfelt thanks to all who made this so remarkable. I\u2019m so proud of you all and the King and Queen today.\u201d",
        "Speaking to The Times\u2019 Red Box Politics podcast ahead of the ceremony, she also disclosed she had been \u201cdoing some press-ups\u201d in preparation for her sword-carrying role.Ms Mordaunt, who is also the Leader of the House of Commons, explained: \u201cThe Lord President of the Council is really the chairman of the King\u2019s Privy Council.\u201cIt used to be the executive for the King, and it still does a lot of business and it\u2019s an important part of our constitution and the authority that we have in Parliament.\u201cOn the day I am representing the King\u2019s authority, and I am going to be doing a number of things.\u201dShe added that she had been practising in rehearsals with weighted replicas and that her experience in the Navy had helped prepare her for standing for long periods of time without fainting.",
        "She carried the 17th-century Sword of State in procession to the abbey.Its silver-gilt hilt features the form of a lion and unicorn and the wooden scabbard is covered in red velvet with silver-gilt rose, thistle and fleur-de-lis emblems.Later in the ceremony Ms Mordaunt exchanged the Sword of State for the Jewelled Sword of Offering and delivered it to the archbishop.The second sword was briefly clipped to the King\u2019s coronation sword belt and then after a proclamation by the archbishop, the King stepped forward and offered up the sword.",
        "It was then placed on the altar and redeemed with \u201credemption money\u201d by Ms Mordaunt.The sword was later drawn and she carried it in its \u201cnaked\u201d form \u2013 without its scabbard \u2013 before the King for the rest of the service.The Jewelled Sword of Offering has a hilt encrusted with diamonds, rubies and emeralds and a scabbard decorated with jewelled roses, thistles and shamrocks.It symbolises royal power and being able to decide between good and evil, and the King accepting his duty and knightly virtues.Asked about being around the King with a \u201cbig pointy sword\u201d, Ms Mordaunt admitted she did feel \u201ca terrible weight of responsibility\u201d.",
        "Discussing how she feels the ceremony fits into modern life, Ms Mordaunt added: \u201cI think this is really important to the country. I think the monarchy survives and persists because it adapts and it changes and it\u2019s always relevant.\u201cAnd I think that in this coronation, yes, it is going to be royal and marvellous and mystical and spiritual and everything that you would expect it to be, but it will be modern as well.\u201cAnd there\u2019s always great chat before an event like this, has it gone too far one way? Has it gone too far the other way? And we always get it absolutely spot on.",
        "\u201cAnd I think that it\u2019s an important moment for the country. I think the country is proud of the monarchy and the royal family and the service they play.\u201cThey provide stability, we saw that most profoundly last year. And they provide continuity and I think as far as how we\u2019re known by the rest of the world, they\u2019re a huge part of our story.\u201cI just hope everyone has an amazing weekend, I know that is what the King would wish.\u201d"
