        "Erik ten Hag has long admired Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s successor David Moyes and knows Manchester United have to be at their best to beat his West Ham side this weekend.",
        "Monday marks the 10th anniversary of the huge announcement that the Scot was stepping down after 26 medal-laden years in the Old Trafford dugout.Ferguson bowed out on the back of a 13th league title \u2013 heights United have not reached since then, enduring their fair share of ups, downs and fallow periods.Moyes was the first man to step into the breach and sacked before the end of the 2013-14 season, with the 60-year-old now in charge of a West Ham outfit hosting United on Sunday.",
        "Asked if he was pleased to be the fifth permanent successor to Ferguson rather than the first, Ten Hag said: \u201cIt\u2019s hypothetical, so you\u2019ll never know.\u201cBut it\u2019s quite clear when you have to succeed Sir Alex that is a big challenge and that is a really difficult job to do.\u201cSo, yeah, he did it, he had the bravery to do it, so that\u2019s why I think I admire him that much. He\u2019s also that long already with many clubs in the Premier League, so it\u2019s a great manager with a lot of skills.\u201cI know my team has to be their best on Sunday. We have to play our maximum if we want to get the result we need, and that\u2019s a win.\u201d",
        "United are looking to tighten their grip on a Champions League spot on Sunday with fifth-placed Liverpool hot on their heels.",
        "Ten Hag\u2019s side have two games in hand on their rivals but the gap sharpens the mind, which could also be beneficial given the all-Manchester FA Cup final against City looms on June 3.\u201cI\u2019m telling them for every game, for every training \u2013 you have to be ready for every game in the Premier League,\u201d he said.\u201cIf you want to be in four competitions, you have to be so well prepared, you need so much energy, you need a good game plan and you have to go every game again.\u201cYou can\u2019t do it in 99 per cent, you have to do it 100 per cent and you have to do it over the full 95 minutes. He's also that long already with many clubs in the Premier League, so it's a great manager with a lot of skills  Erik ten Hag on David Moyes  \u201cThat\u2019s why we like it, top players like it, to have huge challenges, but it costs energy.\u201cBut that\u2019s our job, it\u2019s our responsibility, we have to take it and we lay this aside Sunday. We go again and I\u2019m sure we will be there.\u201d",
        "West Ham have had a free week to prepare for United\u2019s visit, whereas United are reeling from being stung at the death in Thursday\u2019s late 1-0 loss at Brighton.It has been a relentless schedule as the Red Devils balanced domestic and Europa League exertions for much of the season, but Ten Hag believes they have handled it well.\u201c(The schedule) has already an impact on the whole season, and we are doing quite well,\u201d he said.",
        "\u201cWe\u2019re not doing quite well, we\u2019re doing really well. We have a big disadvantage against others. West Ham United, I think, is a team who has the worst schedule, but then us.\u201cBut then we showed all season already we can deal with that. We are physical and mental very strong.\u201dUnited need to keep that going for another month without overstepping the mark.\u201cWe have to keep our heads,\u201d Ten Hag added. \u201cClear. But also I demand passion and desire from my players because if you want to win games, you need that and I think it brought us to where we are now.\u201d"
