        "MEXICO CITY (AP) - Sons of former Sinaloa cartel leader Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n have denied accusations made by U.S. prosecutors last month, saying in a letter that they have no involvement in the production and trafficking of the potent synthetic opioid fentanyl.",
        "The letter was provided to The Associated Press by Jos\u00e9 Refugio Rodr\u00edguez, a lawyer for the Guzm\u00e1n family. Despite not being signed, Rodr\u00edguez said he could confirm that the letter was from Guzm\u00e1n\u00b4s sons.The Mexican government did not explicitly confirm the letter\u00b4s authenticity, but President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador said Thursday it had been analyzed by the country\u00b4s security council.The sons of Guzm\u00e1n said \"we have never produced, manufactured or commercialized fentanyl nor any of its derivatives,\" the letter said. \"We are victims of persecution and have been made into scapegoats.\"Milenio Television first reported the letter Wednesday.U.S. prosecutors detailed in court documents last month how the Sinaloa cartel had become the largest exporter of fentanyl to the United States, resulting in tens of thousands of overdose deaths. Guzm\u00e1n is serving a life sentence in the United States for drug trafficking.",
        "Guzm\u00e1n's sons are known collectively as the \"Chapitos\". Iv\u00e1n Archivaldo Guzm\u00e1n Salazar and Jes\u00fas Alfredo Guzm\u00e1n Salazar are the lead defendants among 23 associates charged in a New York indictment. Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez, alias \"the Mouse,\" who allegedly pushed the cartel into fentanyl, is charged in another indictment in the same district. Mexico arrested him in January and the U.S. government has requested extradition. Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez is charged in the Northern District of Illinois.",
        "U.S. prosecutors say the \"Chapitos\" have tried to concentrate power through violence, including torturing Mexican federal agents and feeding rivals to their pet tigers.The sons deny that too, saying they are not the leaders of the Sinaloa cartel and do not even have tigers. They describe a loose federation of independent drug producers and manufacturers in the state of Sinaloa, many of whom appropriate their name for their own advantage.Mexico arrested Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n in January and has seized some fentanyl laboratories, but L\u00f3pez Obrador has repeatedly denied that Mexico produces the drug and accused U.S. authorities of spying and espionage after the indictments were unsealed."
