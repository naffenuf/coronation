        "Arsenal are two points clear of Manchester City, who have two games in handThe Gunners beat Chelsea 3-1 on Tuesday evening to return top of the tableThey have four games left as they chase their first league title in nearly 20 years\u00a0Mikel Arteta watched his Arsenal team return to the top of the Premier League table with victory over Chelsea before insisting he would not let his players' heads drop.",
        "The Gunners were eight points clear last month but had fallen behind Manchester City following a run of four winless game - a streak that ended with a comfortable 3-1 win over the beleaguered Blues.Captain Martin Odegaard scored twice before Gabriel Jesus wrapped up the win before half-time as Noni Madueke's first league goal proved a mere consolation for Frank Lampard's visitors.Despite their recent run, Arteta had refused to rule Arsenal out of the title race and this win took them two points clear - although they have played two more games than City.The Spaniard admitted he did not want to see morale fall after a galling loss at City last week saw their lead all but dashed.",
        "'It is four games to go, we are at the top right now,' he said.'We cannot do that (let heads drop), to be where we are after 10 months against the team we are fighting against, being there and having the possibility to be top - we have to enjoy it and embrace it, maximise the opportunity that we have because we don't know what is going to happen.'We wanted to have a very different approach to the game, and we did it right from the beginning.'The team is back to its best. We wanted to prove we had that fire in the belly. I could see that in the last few days, and we prepared (for) the game well.",
        "'Mentally we arrived in the right mood and with the right level of energy. Everything went for us as well, which is important.'We've had a couple of difficult weeks with very different games, with a lot of emotions involved. We're back to the top of the league - let's see what happens.'",
        "While it was a night to remember for skipper Odegaard, it was one his predecessor will want to forget in a hurry. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang started for Chelsea for the first time since facing the Gunners on November 6 but lasted just 45 minutes before being substituted, having had nine touches - four of which were kick-offs.Arteta was full of praise for Odegaard and the example set by the Norway international.'He has 14 goals this season, his contribution to the team, his leadership skills, I'm really pleased with him,' he added.'He has been exceptional for us, his contribution every single day. I think he has done that (set the tone) on many occasions. What Martin has done this season deserves a lot of credit.'"
