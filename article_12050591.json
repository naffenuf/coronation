        "United want to sign a striker to start finishing the chances they are creating \u2013 with Tottenham\u2019s Harry Kane top of Ten Hag\u2019s list \u2013 as the club\u2019s multi-billion-pound takeover edges nearer.Ten Hag is focused on finishing fourth but United have failed to win any of their trips to teams in the Premier League\u2019s top nine, their latest loss coming to Brighton.\u00a0That 1-0 defeat thanks to Alexis Mac Allister\u2019s 99th-minute penalty has left United looking over their shoulders to Brighton and Liverpool and Ten Hag said his players need to take responsibility for this sticky situation.\u2018It is always vital that we have to be in the Champions League,\u2019 said Ten Hag. \u2018It is a battle because many teams and clubs in the Premier League are competing for it and they have the power to fight for that as well. We want to be there and will do everything to get there.",
        "\u2018Manchester United, we need to be there in the Champions League. We want to be there because we want to challenge the best teams in the world so we do everything in our power to get that done. I count on my team. We have to do it again.\u2019Though it took a stoppage-time spot-kick for them to win,\u00a0Brighton out-played United over the 90 minutes.\u00a0",
        "Of the few chances that were created by the visitors, Ten Hag was left ruing his lack of a recognised centre forward as Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial and Antony failed to be clinical in front of goal at the Amex Stadium.\u2018There is no time to stay in this,\u2019 Ten Hag said of the Brighton defeat. \u2018In one hour we move on to the game against West Ham. Prepare for them and make a good plan. The players have to take responsibility and I count on them and they can do that.\u2018We have everything in our hands so we have to focus on our performance. I trust my players. I am quite confident about that. Every game is a battle and a challenge so we have to be ready.\u2019Alejandro Garnacho has a chance of being in the squad for the first time in two months at the London Stadium after returning to training following an ankle injury.",
        "\u2018I think it will be the same squad,\u2019 said Ten Hag. \u2018Maybe Garnacho can be involved, but we\u2019ll have to see.\u2019It was a feisty affair against Brighton\u00a0with referee Andre Marriner losing control of the clash. Frustrated as Brighton passed out from the back, 5ft 9in Antony committed a foul on Mac Allister that some have suggested could have led to a red card before squaring up with 6ft 4in Lewis Dunk.",
        "\u2018But his passion is a strength,\u2019 Ten Hag said of Antony. 'Of course, until a certain level, you have to control it. You need passion and desire to win your games and win battles in the game.\u2018It is very strong with him and he is very ambitious. Don't go over the top, stay focused on your game and what the game needs, and if he does that he is a great player.\u2019"
