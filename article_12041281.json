        "Rory McIlroy insists it was an \u201ceasy decision\u201d to potentially forfeit \u00a32.4million in bonus money as he spoke for the first time about how missing the cut in the Masters \u201csucked\u201d.",
        "McIlroy did not speak to waiting reporters after a second round of 77 at Augusta National brought a premature end to his latest bid to win a green jacket and complete the career grand slam.The world number three then withdrew from the RBC Heritage at Hilton Head, meaning he had missed his second \u2018designated event\u2019 of the year on the PGA Tour and was subject to losing 25 per cent of his Player Impact Program bonus.\u201cWe certainly have our minimums, we obviously signed up for this designated-event series this year,\u201d McIlroy said at a promotional event for FedEx ahead of the Wells Fargo Championship.\u201cI obviously knew the consequences that could come with missing one of those. It was an easy decision, but I felt like, if that fine or whatever is to happen, (it) was worth that for me in order to get some things in place.\u201cI had my reasons not to play Hilton Head. I expressed those to Jay [Monahan, the PGA Tour commissioner] and whether he thinks that is enough to warrant\u2026 look, again, I understood the consequences of that decision before I made it.\u201cSo whatever happens, happens.\u201dMcIlroy revealed that he had allowed himself to think about his prospects of becoming just the sixth player to have won all four major titles after shooting five under par on the back nine of his Wednesday practice round at Augusta.",
        " I needed some time to regroup and focus on what\u2019s ahead  Rory McIlroy  \u201cMe thinking that way isn\u2019t a good thing,\u201d the four-time major winner said. \u201cAll I should be thinking about is that first shot on Thursday.\u201cYou need to stay in the present moment and I feel like at Augusta I didn\u2019t quite do a good job of that because of how well I came in playing. I maybe got ahead of myself a little bit.\u201dDescribing his performance, McIlroy added: \u201cIt sucked. It sucked.\u201cIt\u2019s not the performance I obviously thought I was going to put up. Nor was it the performance I wanted. Just incredibly disappointing. But I needed some time to regroup and focus on what\u2019s ahead.\u201cIt\u2019s been a big 12 months and I don\u2019t know if I fully reflected on stuff. I never really got a chance to really think about the Open and St Andrews (where he was joint leader after 54 holes) and everything that went on there.\u201cIt was nice to have three weeks to just put all that stuff in the rearview mirror and just try to focus on what\u2019s ahead.\u201d",
        "What\u2019s ahead on the course includes the US PGA Championship later this month and July\u2019s Open Championship at Hoylake, where McIlroy lifted the Claret Jug in 2014.",
        "And McIlroy hopes he will now be able to expend less energy on his role as an unofficial spokesperson for the PGA Tour in its battle against LIV Golf as the season progresses.\u201cI wasn\u2019t gassed because of the golf, I was gassed because of everything that we\u2019ve had to deal with in the golf world over the past 12 months and being right in the middle of it and being in that decision-making process,\u201d McIlroy added.\u201cI\u2019ve always thought I\u2019ve had a good handle on the perspective of things and where golf fits within my life, but I think over the last 12 months I\u2019d lost sight of that, lost sight of the fact that there\u2019s more to life than the golf world and this silly little squabble that\u2019s going on between tours.\u201cAnd I think once I disconnected from it a little bit, I could see things a little clearer and where everything fits. I guess that was a good reset.\u201d"
