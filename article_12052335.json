        "Sir David Attenborough said the future of humanity depends on state leaders giving their \u201cfull backing\u201d to environmental issues which he believes the King will do.",
        "The broadcaster and naturalist, who turns 97 on Monday, appeared on BBC One with Kirsty Young as part of its coverage ahead of the King\u2019s coronation on Saturday.Sir David said Charles \u201cvery clearly\u201d understood the relationship and importance of the natural world \u201cright from being a small child\u201d.",
        "He said: \u201cWhen he became prominent and an adult, he took a strong line at a time when nature conservation was regarded as being slightly specialist.\u201cBut he realised what it was about and he was mocked actually, because he said \u2018trees are so important I feel like talking to trees\u2019.\u201cBut in fact, he was absolutely right and the world has come to see the world as he saw it.\u201dHe continued: \u201cThe fact is 20 or 30 years ago, it really was sort of oddball to a lot of people.\u201cBut now everybody realises that the future of humanity is dependent upon a healthy natural world.\u201cThe way ahead demands that leaders of the state should actually give their full backing and I\u2019m quite sure that as King he will lead this country in a very important way.\u201dSir David said Prince Philip, the late Duke of Edinburgh, was \u201cvery vigorous in ordering conservation\u201d, adding: \u201cI\u2019m quite sure King Charles will be the same.\u201d",
        "He also spoke about first meeting the then-Prince Charles when he visited the BBC studios at the age of nine and held his pet cockatoo named Cocky.\u201cI had just come back from New Guinea with a load of animals which were going to the London Zoo, but I had a pet cockatoo and I was asked to bring it to the studios, which I did,\u201d he said.\u201cDear little Cocky is sitting on his (Charles\u2019s) hand but in fact they have a very powerful beak and a very powerful bite and although I was fairly confident about Cocky, he could actually have removed his little finger.\u201cBut all was well and it was a very happy occasion.\u201dSpeaking about the coronation on Saturday, Sir David said he was looking forward to the \u201cwhole panoply of the military, the parade, and, of course, the ceremony itself\u201d which he said will be \u201cdeeply moving\u201d."
