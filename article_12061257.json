Leicester and Leeds would have to get another five points from three games,' Carragher said.'We are talking about teams in really poor runs.\u00a0'Newcastle, Chelsea, Man City and Liverpool next week is a tough one for all of those teams, it really is. If anyone picks up a point there it would be a bonus for them.\u00a0",

They had to win this game [against Southampton].\u00a0'This game on paper was far easier than anything else to come. It gives them a great opportunity now as none of the teams down there are really picking up points.'",
