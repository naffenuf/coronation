        "Brandon Boudreaux was returning home from the gym when a bullet ripped through the driver's side door of his Tesla in Gilbert, Arizona, on October 2, 2019. At the time, Boudreaux was locked in divorce talks with his estranged wife Melani, the mother of his four children and Vallow's niece.Ryan Pillar, a detective with Gilbert PD, told Vallow's trial at the Ada County Courthouse in Boise that her brother Alex Cox was behind the attempted hit.The State alleges that Vallow wanted Boudreaux dead so that she could get hold of a life insurance payout that would have gone to her niece.Vallow, 49, and her husband Chad Daybell, 54, are accused of murdering her two kids JJ, seven, and Tylee, 16, in Rexburg, Idaho, in September, 2019. The State claims Vallow's brother Cox - who died of natural causes in December of that year - took part in the killings.",
        "Vallow and Daybell are further of accused of murdering his wife Tammy Daybell a month after the children's deaths. The doomsday couple married in Hawaii two weeks later.Pillar explained to jurors how they quickly established Cox as their chief suspect when they discovered the Jeep Wrangler he was driving had been involved in another shooting.That July, Cox had shot dead Vallow's then-husband Charles in nearby Chandler, Arizona. At the time Cox claimed self defense, but Vallow has since been charged over that killing.",
        "Soon after Charles was killed, she moved to Rexburg to be near to religious author Daybell with whom she had been carrying out an affair.Cox is also believed to have been behind an attempted shooting of Tammy Daybell ten days before she was suffocated in bed at home in Rexburg.\u00a0Pillar said after interviewing Boudreaux and his neighbors the cops found that a Jeep Wrangler was used in the shooting. It was gray and had Texas plates - the same as a vehicle at the scene of Charles Vallow's killing.The Jeep's back wheel had been removed, which Pillar explained was significant because this would allow for the rear window to be opened.\u00a0When the vehicle was later seized by the Arizona cops they found gun residue in the rear of the car.\u00a0In trying to track down Cox, Pillar discovered that his law enforcement colleagues in Idaho were also dealing with Vallow's missing children and Tammy Daybell's death.'They were successful in contacting Alex, Chad and Lori but were unsuccessful in locating the children,' he told the court.Gilbert PD then liaised with the FBI and the focus turned to trying to find the missing kids.Pillar said they attempted to find the kids by talking to school friends they'd had in Arizona and carried out checks on homes, but the children could not be found.",
        "It took nine months for cops to track the children down to shallow graves in Daybell's backyard in Rexburg.While the children were missing Vallow and Daybell continued claiming their social security and health benefits. Daybell also secured his wife's life insurance payout after her death.If the hit had been successful on Boudreaux, Melani - who was part of their cult - would have received $200,000. In the end she got $300,000 from their divorce settlement.Vallow's children were missing for almost a year before their corpses were found buried in Daybell's yard on June 9, 2020.During the opening, prosecutor Lindsey Blake described how charred remains were all that was left of Tylee.She told jurors: 'You will hear it explained as a mass of bone and tissue. That's what was left of this beautiful young woman.'Tylee's DNA was later found on a pickaxe and shovel in a shed on the property.JJ's body was wrapped in trash bags and duct tape - the tape binding his arms in front of him and wrapping around his head. He had been suffocated inside a plastic bag.The two children and Daybell's previous wife Tammy were all killed because they stood in the way of the couple's relationship, the State says.\u00a0",
        "'Remember, the defendant will remove any obstacle in her way to get what she wants, and she wanted Chad Daybell,' Blake told jurors.",
        "'The defendant used money, power and sex to get what she wanted.'Jurors have heard from friends and relatives of Vallow that she and Daybell believed the children were 'dark' and referred to them as 'zombies' before they disappeared.'The common theme was the body has to be destroyed,' Blake said. 'The defendant and Chad used their self-proclaimed religious teachings to justify their actions to others \u2014 their actions from affair to murder.'Prosecutors say the couple planned to use life insurance money from Tammy's death, and that Vallow kept collecting and spending the children's social security and benefits after they died.The trial opened on April 10 and the State is still laying out its case.\u00a0Vallow denies two counts\u00a0of first-degree murder and three counts of conspiracy in the deaths of her two children and Tammy Daybell.She further denies grand theft for allegedly collecting government benefits on behalf of her children after they were killed.Daybell is being tried separately.",
