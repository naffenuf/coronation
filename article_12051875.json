        "WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT\u00a0Fuller video shows the 2 minutes after Jordan Neely appeared to go limp\u00a0A bystander warned Penny of a 'murder charge' and told him to let Neely go\u00a0READ MORE: Marine veteran in chokehold incident is decorate sergeant\u00a0An extended video of Marine veteran Daniel Penny putting homeless\u00a0man Jordan Neely in a fatal chokehold shows him continuing to restrain Neely for 45 seconds after he went limp and ignoring bystanders who warned: 'You're going to kill him.'",
        "Penny was questioned by the NYPD on Monday but was released without charge.\u00a0The investigation is ongoing and it is likely that a grand jury will be impaneled to determined whether or not charges should be brought.\u00a0Penny's attorney tells DailyMail.com they have contacted the DA's Office and the NYPD to cooperate.\u00a0ABC cites law enforcement sources who say the DA's office have spoken with six witnesses, but are seeking at least another four.\u00a0\u00a0Initial footage showed Penny holding Neely in a chokehold while two other men restrained his arms, but it did not show the moment Penny released him.\u00a0",
        "Witnesses say Neely, who was schizophrenic, was behaving erratically, throwing garbage and screaming that he wanted to 'die' or 'go to jail' because he was fed up about having no food.\u00a0The longer video that emerged today shows the three minutes and 52 seconds after the train pulled into Broadway Lafayette station on Monday at 2.30pm.\u00a0The footage begins with Penny already with Neely in the chokehold. For two minutes and five seconds, Neely struggled on the floor, flailing his feet.\u00a0He went limp after two minutes and six seconds, by which point a by-passer had stepped onto the train.The man - who can be heard but is not seen - warned Penny that Neely had defecated, which he feared was a sign that he was dying.",
        "'He's defecated on himself... you're going to kill him now,' he said.\u00a0",
        "Another man who was helping Penny restrain Neely replied that it was an old stain on Neely's trousers, and that Penny was no longer 'squeezing'.\u00a0'He's not squeezing? All right. Because after he's defecated himself that's it. You've got to let him go,' he replied.\u00a0He then warned of a 'murder charge'.\u00a0\u00a0The second man turned to Neely and said: 'Hey can you hear me?'.\u00a0Met with silence, the man told Penny to stand up.\u00a0Penny does not speak, but releases Neely and springs to his feet.\u00a0The unidentified by-stander can be heard saying: 'That was one hell of a chokehold, man.'\u00a0Over the next several seconds, Penny and the other man who had been helping him attempt to put Neely in the recovery position.\u00a0After three minutes and 50 seconds, Neely appears to convulse or take a deep breath.\u00a0The video cuts out at three minutes and 52 seconds. It is unclear whether he moved again.",
        "The NYC Medical Examiner who yesterday ruled Neely's death a homicide has not confirmed the exact time of death.\u00a0Police arrived at the scene but Neely did not regain consciousness.\u00a0He was pronounced dead at Lenox Hill hospital later in the afternoon.\u00a0Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg must now weigh whether or not to bring charges.\u00a0",
        "He and the NYPD are appealing to the public for information about the incident. There were no surveillance cameras on-board the train in question.\u00a0In a statement yesterday, a spokesman for the DA's office said: 'This is a solemn and serious matter that ended in the tragic loss of Jordan Neely\u2019s life.\u00a0'As part of our rigorous ongoing investigation, we will review the Medical Examiner\u2019s report, assess all available video and photo footage, identify and interview as many witnesses as possible, and obtain additional medical records.\u00a0'This investigation is being handled by senior, experienced prosecutors and we will provide an update when there is additional public information to share.\u00a0'The Manhattan D.A.\u2019s Office encourages anyone who witnessed or has information about this incident to call 212-335-9040.'"
