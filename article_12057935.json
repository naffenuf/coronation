        "SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) - Toronto goalie Ilya Samsonov left the ice 37 seconds into the second period of the Maple Leafs' playoff game at Florida on Sunday night with an undisclosed injury.",
        "The play started with Samsonov stopping a shot by Florida\u00b4s Anthony Duclair, as the Panthers\u00b4 Carter Verhaeghe came down the slot chasing the rebound.Verhaeghe got tripped by Toronto\u00b4s Luke Schenn, and Schenn also crashed into Samsonov on the same play. Samsonov remained down for more than a minute, eventually got to his feet and skated to the Toronto bench - going directly down the tunnel to the Maple Leafs\u00b4 locker room.Joseph Woll replaced Samsonov, coming in cold to face the Florida power play. Woll stopped the first shot he faced, but Duclair scored with 1 second left on the power play to tie the game at 1-1.___AP NHL playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"
