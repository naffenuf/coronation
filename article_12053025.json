        "\u00a0One minister said the\u00a0Conservative Party chairman's credibility had taken a hit\u00a0Yesterday Greg Hands acknowledged that the results were \u2018disappointing\u2019An inquest\u00a0was under way at Conservative Central Office last night after local election results came in worse than expected.",
        "Conservative Party chairman Greg Hands faced a backlash from Tory MPs after a \u2018lacklustre\u2019 campaign ended in a bruising night at the ballot box.One minister said: \u2018There is an inquest going on at CCHQ and quite rightly so.\u2018It is clear that their analysis was way out.\u2018We were being told to expect losses in the region of 500-700, which suggests that they didn\u2019t really know what was going on \u2013 that is a big worry. Greg\u2019s credibility has taken a hit.",
        "\u2018This was never going to be a good night for us, but we fought a lacklustre campaign. We were outfought by Labour and that should not be happening.\u2019Mr Hands had focused his campaign on highlighting an infamous letter which former Labour Treasury minister Liam Byrne left behind for his successor after losing the 2010 election, which read: \u2018Dear Chief Secretary, I\u2019m afraid there is no money.\u2019Tory MPs were last night circulating an image of Mr Hands holding a mocked up version of the letter which had been altered to read: \u2018I\u2019m sorry, there are no councillors left.\u2019Yesterday Mr Hands acknowledged that the results were \u2018disappointing\u2019 but he insisted that they were \u2018not uniformly good for Labour\u2019 either.However, some senior Tories said that Rishi Sunak had to take the blame for a low-key campaign which did not even receive a formal press launch.\u00a0",
        "One said: \u2018Rishi has no option but to own these results.",
        "\u2018He has been either the chancellor or Prime Minister for virtually all of the last three years, and it was he and his supporters who forced Boris and then Liz out of office in order to install him in Downing Street.\u2019Tory sources last night defended the campaign and CCHQ\u2019s performance, pointing out that Mr Hands had raised the possibility that the party could lose 1,000 seats last month.\u00a0Other senior Tories had also discussed the idea of potentially of losing 1,000 seats before the elections, but this was considered an attempt to manage expectations.One source said: \u2018This was never going to be an easy set of elections. We are 13 years into government, there is a cost of living crisis and there has also been a lot of turmoil in government in the last year.\u2018But the Prime Minister is only six months in \u2013 that is not a long time to turn things round and he is going to need a bit of time.\u00a0'But we have got to stick to our guns and focus on trying to deliver on the people\u2019s priorities.\u2019"
