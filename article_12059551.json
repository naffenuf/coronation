        "The 58-year-old used his Instagram platform to disclose a vile message he had received from a disgruntled viewer on Sunday.\u00a0The troll referred to Emdur as a 'dead s**t' and asked him 'Who watches you anyway these days?' The cruel words were posted alongside a vomit face emoji.\u00a0However, Larry masterfully countered the troll, sharing their message to his page with their name obscured.\u00a0'So, two things: Firstly, I 100% agree with you,' he wrote.",
        "'Secondly, and I'm not a qualified doctor, but honestly you need to unfollow me IMMEDIATELY!!! and go and follow people on Insta who make you happy, make you smile and bring you joy.'All the best,' he signed off, adding a red heart emoji.His response sent his followers into a frenzy, with Larry's co-host Kylie Gillies teasing: 'Why did you black out my name?'\u00a0",
