        "Royal fans were left\u00a0scratching their heads at some of the lesser-known guestsThe list of snubbed aristocrats was longer than the King's sweeping Coronation robes \u2013 so eyebrows were raised at the 'stars' who did manage to bag invitations.",
        "While dukes, peers and huge swathes of the great and good were denied a seat in Westminster Abbey, a parade of celebrities \u2013 including singer Katy Perry, actress Dame Emma Thompson and TV favourites Ant and Dec \u2013 flaunted their hottest tickets in town.But Royal fans were left scratching their heads at some of the lesser-known guests \u2013 such as Stereophonics singer Kelly Jones and rocker Nick Cave, known as the 'dark lord' of goth music.Many queried why magician Dynamo, real name Steven Frayne, was there, along with TV presenter Jay Blades, known for his role in the furniture restoring show Repair Shop.Social media was ablaze, with one Twitter user joking: 'Heavy that Charles doesn't have enough mates so had to invite Kelly Jones and Dynamo.'",
        "It is understood Dynamo owed his invitation to his role as an ambassador with The Prince's Trust, Charles's charity.In the upper echelons of British high society, there have been bruised egos aplenty as the guest count was cut from the 8,000 invitees who attended Queen Elizabeth's service at Westminster Abbey in 1953 to just 2,300 yesterday.The Lord Chamberlain's office at Buckingham Palace, responsible for organising the occasion, weeded out dukes, peers, MPs and anyone deemed surplus to requirements. It's like a cocktail party... because you know everyone\u00a0 ",
        "Then they went for the 'plus ones'. In aristocratic circles, the cull was referred to as the 'slash the spouses', with even the wider Royal Family affected.\u00a0Lord Freddie Windsor's actress wife lost out when one of the invitations dropped through their letterbox \u2013 with only his name on it.So there was bafflement at some of the guests \u2013 including Dame Emma Thompson's husband Greg Wise \u2013 who did receive invitations.The Oscar-winning actress, 64, could barely contain her glee as she gave a cheesy thumbs-up to photographers outside the cathedral.Pop star Katy Perry, who will perform at the Coronation concert tonight, captivated spectators as she wandered the Abbey looking like a lost lamb as she struggled to locate her seat.The star wore a magnificent wide-brimmed fascinator, which some suggested had impaired her ability to navigate through the aisles.",
        "Ant and Dec \u2013 Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly \u2013 were so surprised to be asked along they feared their invitation was someone getting their own back for their TV pranks, where the pair have wound up a host of celebrities for the cameras.Dec said yesterday: 'It comes through the door and you think, 'Hang on a minute, is it finally our time to get wound up?' '",
        "Lionel Richie, 73, was in the Abbey explaining how he got the call-up for tonight's Coronation concert from his friend King Charles, a professional lip reader claimed.The Dancing On The Ceiling singer was all smiles, chatting to guests including London Mayor Sadiq Khan.Dame Judi Dench, Stephen Fry, BBC director-general Tim Davie, comedian Andy Hill and Andrew Lloyd Webber also attended.Absolutely Fabulous star Dame Joanna Lumley, 77, arrived wearing a navy gown with white lapels.\u00a0She said afterwards it had been an 'extraordinary' occasion, telling Sky News: 'It was a bit like a cocktail party because you seem to know everybody who's coming in.'",
        "There was speculation when two of the best known first ladies in the world \u2013 America's Jill Biden and Ukraine's Olena Zelenska \u2013 were seated at the back of the Abbey, behind lesser-known representatives from countries including Serbia, Slovakia and Macedonia.However, it is understood that the seating plan was alphabetical, meaning the USA and Ukraine were placed together, behind countries beginning with letters at the start of the alphabet.The incendiary guest list included Chinese vice-president Han Zheng, blamed for overseeing a crackdown on freedoms in Hong Kong, and Sinn Fein leader Michelle O'Neill.Meanwhile, there was no sign of some expected celebrities, such as David and Victoria Beckham.\u00a0",
        "The Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson, who was also not there, tweeted that she had 'the bunting out'."
