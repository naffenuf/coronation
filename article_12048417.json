        "WASHINGTON, May 4 (Reuters) - Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr said on Thursday that his government and China were slowly inching toward a solution in an energy exploration dispute in the South China Sea. Speaking to a U.S. think-tank during a visit to Washington, Marcos said Manila was still working on establishing a crisis hotline with Beijing amid maritime tensions between the two countries and he hopes it will be in place soon.
