        "Warnock guided the Terriers to survival after taking over the club in FebruaryThe 77-year-old admitted that he won't stay on as boss of Huddersfield TownHe believes that 'the job is done' for him after guiding the club to safety this yearNeil Warnock strolled into the press conference room at the John Smith\u2019s Stadium half an hour after Sheffield United manager Paul Heckingbottom had concluded his post-match duties and made sure he was worth the wait.",
        "For the best part of the next half an hour, the 74-year-old spoke with all the humour, honesty and love for the game that has seen become somewhat of an icon over the years, with constant mentions of Sharon (his wife) who persuaded him to to take the Huddersfield Town job, tales of Pep Guardiola\u2019s Man City been the best side he has ever seen and so much more.In an era of cliche-filled press conferences, the sheer authenticity of Warnock was refreshing in itself. In truth, he could have gone on all night.Before the 74-year-old had even sat down to discuss Huddersfield\u2019s great escape - 30 years after his first stint as Terriers boss - he turned to Steven Chicken of the Huddersfield Examiner and thanked him directly.\u2018Can I thank you Steven for picking the team? My team was different and then I read your column in the paper this morning and decided to go a little bit more defensive,\u2019 Warnock admitted.",
        "On Thursday morning, he opted for Rarmani Edmonds-Green at right wing-back and played Josh Koroma up front, instead of Joseph Hungbo.\u2018Where do you want your statue (for saving Huddersfield) then?\u2019 asked Steven.\u2018There\u2019ll be a few pigeons happy about that, all over the country,\u2019 responded Warnock in typical fashion.",
        "Huddersfield may have been 90 minutes away from the Premier League this time last year but the euphoria from the twenty-thousand plus at full-time in West Yorkshire after a 1-0 win to secure their Championship status and the adulation for Warnock around at the ground showed just how much this meant.Even Warnock himself said it was the biggest achievement of his 43-year managerial career after coming out of retirement in February, with Huddersfield just a point off the bottom.\u2018Right at the top (it ranks) - I\u2019ve not had anything more difficult,\u2019 Warnock told Mail Sport.",
        "\u2018I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been any prouder. I think it\u2019s a massive achievement.\u2018When Ronnie Jepson (his assistant) phoned me after the Stoke City game (which Huddersfield lost 3-0), I was in New York and he said to me \u2018Gaffer, are you sure? It\u2019s the worst team I\u2019ve ever seen in the Championship.\u2019\u2018So to come and then have two four-nil defeats and still get out (of the relegation places), it's just fantastic. I can't be any prouder to be the man in charge when we've done something like this.\u2018And I like to think we\u2019ve had a bit of humour and we\u2019ve had a laugh along the way.\u2018You've got to get a dressing room that wants to do it for you. That wants to die for three points,\u2019 said Warnock, fittingly.",
        "From seven wins in 31 games before Warnock\u2019s arrival to six wins in 14 under him and Jepson, they have transformed the fortunes of the Terriers.",
        "And the pair were even given a guard of honour by the Huddersfield squad.\u2018That\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever had one of them,\u2019 admitted Warnock.\u2018It was quite emotional all the way around the ground. It\u2019s been an amazing roller coaster ride.\u2018I think this will have converted youngsters to be Huddersfield Town fans for years to come. Because I remember going to Bramall Lane one night and it was amazing. I think it was Arsenal we were playing in floodlights, and I just remember wow! Joe Shaw, Doc (Derek) Pace and how brilliant they were and that just did me. I had to be Sheffield United I and I hope this will have created a few more Huddersfield Town fans.\u2018You can\u2019t replicate an evening like this when that whistle goes - no matter what you say. As old as I am, it\u2019s still the same when that whistle goes and you know how much it means. It\u2019s just a fantastic feeling,\u2019 Warnock insisted.Asked about what he put down the successes of himself and the likes of 75-year-old Roy Hodgson at Crystal Palace to, Warnock stressed the importance of experience.",
        "\u2018Yeah but he has some good players doesn\u2019t he Roy. Wilfried Zaha, Ebere Eze, Michael Olise and all them. Bloody hell, I\u2019d have that job,\u2019 joked Warnock.\u2018When you get older, I think it\u2019s the calmness and the confidence that you bring. You look at what Roy\u2019s done and he\u2019s just given them freedom. Like (Jaheim) Headley here. At half-time, I gave him a roasting telling him \u2018I\u2019d have played somebody else if I\u2019d have known you were going to cut back inside all the time. Take him on. I\u2019m not bothered if you lose it\u2019.\u2019\u2018I thought in the second-half he was super and it\u2019s just directing them really,\u2019 added Warnock.\u2018I could stop here with you lot all night but I want a Negroni now,\u2019 he laughed as the questions kept on coming.",
        "\u2018Anyone else?\u2019 asked Warnock before noticing former Sheffield United striker Carl Asaba, who played under him at Bramall Lane, in amongst the dozen or so journalists.\u2018Sarbs, I didn\u2019t bloody recognise you with your hat on! I\u2019ve only just seen you now Sarbs. Bloody hell, are you alright? Is your family alright?,\u2019 Warnock asked.And even when the Huddersfield Town Communications Director David Threlfall-Sykes finally signalled an end to proceedings, Warnock\u2019s next comment was to ask, \u2018When are we doing press for Monday?\u2019",
        "Like a child buzzing with excitement. Over 1600 matches later, but still in love with the game.Monday\u2019s clash against Reading now will be a survival party for Huddersfield fans, as advertised by the stadium announcer minutes after the final whistle had blown, where Warnock will also say goodbye as his short-term contract expires. For now, he has no plans of extending or of taking another job.\u2018I couldn\u2019t do ten months of this. I\u2019ll be back next February somewhere. I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll (Sharon) get fed up of me at home,\u2019 joked Warnock.\u2018But I think the job\u2019s done here for me. I\u2019ve really enjoyed it.\u2019All good things must come to an end. It\u2019s just a lot better when it\u2019s a happy ending.And for those a few miles up the M62 at Elland Road, they will be hoping that another managerial veteran in Sam Allaradyce, will give them their own great escape."
