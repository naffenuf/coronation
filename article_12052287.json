        "In a trailer for season three of The Kardashians, the mother of two said, 'All of us need to have a bigger conversation about the beauty standards we\u2019re setting,\u00a0 adding, 'I don\u2019t want my daughter to do the things I did.'The reality star who shares daughter Stormi, five, and son Aire, one, with ex-partner Travis Scott, 32, has denied having cosmetic surgery, but admitted to using fillers.\u00a0",

I don't regret it.'But she said, otherwise, she has been comfortable in her own skin.'I think a big misconception about me is that I've had so much surgery on my face and that I was some insecure person, and I really wasn't!''Yeah, I love full lips and wanted full lips,' she continued, 'but growing up I was always the most confident person in the room. I was the girl performing for everyone.'\u00a0The Kylie Baby entrepreneur said motherhood has 'made me love myself more.''I see my features in my daughter and my son now, but you know, my daughter looks like me. I get to see my beauty in her, and it\u2019s made me love myself more for sure. Beauty is always changing for me. '",
        "And as young Stormi grows up in her mother's shadow, Kylie shared the only beauty advice she would give to her daughter.\u00a0'That she\u2019s perfect the way that she is. Be confident, always be confident in yourself.'\u00a0"
