        "Tranmere have announced the appointment of caretaker boss Ian Dawes as the club\u2019s new permanent manager.",
        "Dawes, 60, took temporary charge of the Sky Bet League Two club for the third time after Micky Mellon was sacked in March.Rovers said in a statement: \u201cThe club has considered several highly qualified candidates, however Ian\u2019s coaching abilities, knowledge of the playing squad and the staff as well as the club\u2019s aims to balance player development with winning games ultimately made him the standout choice.\u201dAndy Parkinson will continue in his role as first-team coach, while the club continue their search for a technical director.Dawes said: \u201cIt\u2019s an honour to be appointed manager of Tranmere. Having already had three interim spells, I\u2019m now ready to take control of the team and implement my own style and ideas.\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity I\u2019m relishing and I want to reassure the fans that I personally hate failure and would not have taken the job unless I was confident of bringing success to the club.\u201d",
        "Tranmere have climbed up three places to 11th in the table since Mellon\u2019s departure, with Dawes winning two and drawing four of his eight games in charge.Dawes will be targeting a top-10 finish before Monday\u2019s final game of the season at home against automatic promotion hopefuls Northampton."
