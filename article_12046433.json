        "The swanky Brighton mansion certainly fits the couples expensive taste, and the WAG has now questioned whether her kitchen needs a fancy mechanical cocktail shaker.\u00a0Posting to her Instagram story on Thursday, the 40-year-old shared a video from a bar at Chadstown that showed the fancy cocktail shaker in action.\u00a0She captioned the clip: 'The cocktail shaker at City Fields at @chadstone_fashion.\u00a0'I need a slightly smaller one for home'.\u00a0",
        "The couple, who share children Oscar, Billie, Tom and Darcy, have made many renovations to their Spanish Colonial home to make it suitable for their needs.\u00a0They spent\u00a0$50,000 to knock out a column in their garage because it didn't fit their large Range Rover.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Last month, the mother-of-four was left distraught after she was refused service at a bottle shop.",
        "She took to Instagram and revealed she was turned away from a liquor store in New Zealand because she did not look 'old enough' to buy a bottle of wine.\u00a0Posting to her stories, the influencer said she and her sister Kate were refused service because they could not produce identification to prove they were over 18 - the local legal age to purchase liquor.\u00a0The siblings wanted to purchase a bottle of NZ Wairau River Ros\u00e9, when the incident occurred.",
