        "TAURUS\u00a021 April-21 May\u00a0",
        "Ignore what others say you should do and listen only to your inner voice, which is now telling you to have fun. Someone you meet will have a major effect on you in the weeks ahead. It may or may not be a romantic attachment but it will be a life-changer.CALL 0904 470 1162*GEMINI22 May-21 June\u00a0You\u2019ll learn something that will boost your earning power. Some may say it\u2019s immoral to take advantage of an unearned tip-off but it\u2019s just sour grapes and in your shoes they\u2019d do the same. If Lady Luck smiles on you it would be rude not to smile back.\u00a0CALL 0904 470 1163*CANCER22 June-23 July\u00a0You\u2019ll be faced with\u00a0a challenging situation but, with amiable Venus entering your sign, your laid-back attitude will make everything seem easy. It\u2019sa shame you can\u2019t bottle it as it would make you a fortune, and then you could retire and take life easier still.\u00a0CALL 0904 470 1164*",
        "LEO24 July-23 Aug\u00a0You may not like your fate being in another\u2019s hands but the planets indicate they have your interests at heart. Some people like being generous and such a person will go out of their way to smooth your path through life. Go out of your way to enjoy it.\u00a0",
        "CALL 0904 470 1165*VIRGO24 Aug-23 Sept\u00a0You\u2019ll be remarkably laid-back; you won\u2019t care what happens, be it good, bad or indifferent, so long as you can face it alongside family and friends. In fact, the bigger the challenge, the more you\u2019ll like it. It will give you the chance to show that you have what it takes.\u00a0CALL 0904 470 1166*LIBRA24 Sept-23 Oct\u00a0There are times when you tend to treat life as a battle. Luckily, as your ruler Venus, planet of harmony and love, crosses the success-orientated midheaven point of your chart, people in positions of power will look on you kindly. Not everyone is out to get you.\u00a0CALL 0904 470 1167*SCORPIO24 Oct-22 Nov\u00a0This is not a good week for routine matters, especially if you\u2019re\u00a0a Scorpio who\u2019s easily distracted. There is far too much going on in your world to allow you to concentrate on anything that doesn\u2019t excite you. Let the drudges of the zodiac take care of the tedious stuff.\u00a0CALL 0904 470 1168*SAGITTARIUS23 Nov-21 Dec\u00a0Some people seem to enjoy finding fault with everything you do, but that\u2019s no reason to take any of it seriously. The more they criticise your efforts the more determined you should be to carry on the same as before. Let everyone see you won\u2019t be intimidated.\u00a0",
        "CALL 0904 470 1169*CAPRICORN22 Dec-20 Jan\u00a0With Venus, planet of affection, in the partnership area of your chart you can expect warmer-than-usual responses from loved ones. Don\u2019t be wary if someone you\u2019ve fallen out with wants to kiss and make up. Make sure they know there are no hard feelings.\u00a0CALL 0904 470 1170*AQUARIUS\u00a021 Jan-19 Feb\u00a0No matter how great your stamina, if you continue at your current pace you\u2019ll be burned out by next weekend. Identify your priorities and focus on them to the exclusion of all else. You\u2019re doing too many things for too many people. Do more for yourself.\u00a0CALL 0904 470 1171*PISCES20 Feb-20 March\u00a0As Venus enters the most romantic area of your chart, affairs of the heart will predominate. No need to be assertive; with charm like yours you can get anything \u2013 and anyone \u2013 you desire, simply by smiling and saying the right thing. Who could resist?\u00a0CALL 0904 470 1172*ARIES\u00a0\u00a021 March-20 April\u00a0For once you\u2019re on the same wavelength as those around you and can easily persuade them to do things for you, especially at home. But each time they do you a favour you must reward them. Show them you appreciate their efforts. Let them know you care.\u00a0",
