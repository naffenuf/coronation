Much to my sadness.'While Molly-Mae looked comfortable in her pricey ensemble, she recently divided her social media followers, who accused her of flaunting her wealth by posing in an airport terminal surrounded by her \u00a34,000 designer luggage.Having just returned from a lavish family holiday in Dubai, the star cut a casual figure in a black T-shirt, matching leggings and an oversized blazer as she sat outside a Hermes boutique in a post shared on Sunday.She styled her long blonde tresses pulled back in a claw clip leaving strands to frame her face as she leaned on her hand.The reality star seemed less than impressed in the picture as she sat next to her \u00a32,200 Louis Vuitton suitcase and her matching \u00a31,790 travel bag.Molly-Mae looked ready for her flight as she kept her AirPod Max headphones, which are worth over \u00a3500, around her neck.
