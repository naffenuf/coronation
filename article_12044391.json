        "MADRID (AP) - Atletico Madrid continued its winning form by routing Cadiz 5-1 and overtaking Real Madrid for second place in the Spanish league on Wednesday.",
        "Antoine Griezmann scored twice in the first half and \u00c1lvaro Morata, Yannick Carrasco and Nahuel Molina each added a goal in the second to give Atletico its 12th win in 14 league matches. Diego Simeone's team moved a point in front of Madrid with five rounds remaining.It is the first time this season Atletico moved into second spot in the standings, which is particularly important because it guarantees a spot in the lucrative Spanish Super Cup in Saudi Arabia.Madrid, which lost 2-0 at Real Sociedad on Tuesday, had been in the top two since the early rounds. It is now focused on Saturday's Copa del Rey final against Osasuna and the Champions League semifinal against Manchester City.Atletico would still make it to the Super Cup by finishing third behind Madrid, though, which earned its spot for the tournament in Saudi Arabia by reaching the Copa final. It wouldn't make it if it finished third behind another team.Atletico is 13 points behind leader Barcelona, which has the chance to clinch its first league title in four years in the next round.Atletico has been the hottest team in Spain in the final stretch of the season. Its only setbacks recently were a 1-1 draw against Getafe, a 1-1 draw at Madrid and a 1-0 loss at Barcelona. The domestic league is the only competition it is still participating after disappointing results in Europe and in the Copa.",
