        "A number of people were left unable to cast ballots in local elections as they did not bring valid photo ID.",
        "Others had to make two trips to the polling booth as they did not initially bring photo ID.The local elections mark the first time voters in Great Britain have been required to show photo ID at polling stations before casting their ballot.James Toft, 41, was unable to vote in Chesterfield this morning as he had forgotten his photo ID. If you want people to vote, you should make it as easy as possible, and they\u2019ve added a barrier  Gillian Long  The support worker said he \u201cleft in a bit of a huff\u201d because work commitments meant he could not return later in the day with ID.Although he said the refusal was \u201cpartly his fault,\u201d he added: \u201cThe ID requirement is silly.\u201d",
        "Mr Toft believes the requirement to bring photo ID to the polling booth could be detrimental to people voting, telling the PA news agency: \u201cThey\u2019ll take a look at what you need to do and just not bother voting, especially the younger ones, what about the less well off who can\u2019t afford a passport or other forms (of identification)?Gillian Long, 42, said ID requirements are \u201ca load of rubbish\u201d after she was stopped from voting by an administration error between her ID and the registration system in East Riding, Yorkshire.",
        "Ms Long told PA that her address \u201cwasn\u2019t down right on their system\u201d.She said: \u201cI\u2019ve lived there six years and never had an issue.\u201dMs Long, who works as a bespoke tailor, added that she was told to ring the council, but when she spoke to another woman at the polling station, she was eventually allowed to vote.She said: \u201cLuckily I was quite determined to vote, so I decided to question it.\u201cI called my other half to warn him before he goes to vote this evening that our address is wrong, and he said he\u2019s not going to bother voting.\u201dMs Long said: \u201cIf you want people to vote, you should make it as easy as possible, and they\u2019ve added a barrier.\u201d"
