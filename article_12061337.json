        "Comedian Fergus Neal urges Aussies to steal lettuceNeal said Woolworths using inflation as 'smoke screen'Users slammed the comedian's 'stupid remarks'An Australian comedian has been slammed for urging shoppers to do their national duty and steal from Woolworths as a way to tackle inflation.",
        "Melbourne's Fergus Neal encouraged Aussies to steal a 'god damn' head of lettuce as cost of living pressures are felt across the country.The young comedian shared a video to social media last week and claimed that inflation is used by Woolworths as a 'smoke screen' to increase prices and company profits rather than 'easily absorbing' the costs of supply chain\u00a0issues.'Next time you're at Woolworths, do your Australian duty and steal a god damn lettuce,' Fergus said.\u00a0\u00a0Users have condemned his 'stupid remarks' saying he is encouraging crime and has no idea how inflation works.'Stealing from the supermarkets results in increased prices for all shoppers to cover the supermarkets' losses,' one person commented.",
        "'What a stupid remark, will he pay your fine and court fees when charged for stealing plus you get a black mark against your name,' another said.'I know what it feels like to have things stolen and I will not steal from anyone else for any reason.'Others said the comedian would be singing a different tune if he was the target.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Perhaps someone should steal from Fergus Neal... when is his next gig?' one wrote.'How about people head over to Fergus Neal's place and see what is on offer to take,' another said.",
        "When contacted by Daily Mail Australia about what Fergus thought of the backlash to his Tik Tok he responded, 'Let Them Eat Lettuce'.Neal claimed increased costs from supply chain issues and energy prices are being passed onto the consumer despite big corporations making record profits.\u00a0'Inflation is being used as a smoke screen so that Woolworths can add to their 2 billion a year profit margins instead of easily absorbing costs associated with supply chain issues and energy prices,' Neal said.'The reserve bank knows that corporations are doing this and their solution is to curb your spending power by demanding wages fail to increase while interest rates do.'Your buying power is being affected so that the buying power of corporate CEOs is not.'",
        "Neal's video received more than 39,000 views and more than 150 comments.Minor incidences of shoplifting (involving goods valued at less than $150) are dealt with by the police, with offenders issued an on-the-spot theft infringement notice.In February, Woolworths posted a $907million profit for the first half of the 2022- 2023 financial year - a 14 per cent increase from the previous year.Woolworths CEO Brad Banducci said despite continued supply chain challenges most customer metrics improved during the first half of the financial year.",
        "'Our first half result benefitted from a focus on improving our customer shopping experience, restoring our operating rhythm, the non-recurrence of material COVID costs in the prior year and strong seasonal trading,' Mr Banducci said.'Cost-of-living pressures are being felt by our customers due to industry-wide inflation and helping all our customers get their Woolies worth remains our number one priority.'Fellow grocery juggernaut Coles posted half-yearly results revealing $20.8billion in total revenue and a profit of $616million - up 17.1 per cent.The supermarket giant's total revenue was $12.4million less than Woolies, which also posted $291million more in profit at $907million.",
        "Neal's call comes after the Reserve Bank of Australia hiked interest rates for the 11th time in the past 12 months in an attempt to combat inflation.The Reserve Bank of Australia raised interest rates by 0.25 percentage points on May 2 taking the cash rate to an 11-year high of 3.85 per cent.The move flies in the face of the financial markets, which had almost unanimously predicted the RBA would leave rates on hold.The RBA has also left open the possibility of further rate increases, with Reserve Bank Governor Philip Lowe describing inflation as still too high at 7 per cent in March.Despite the rising interest rates and the surging cost of living, big supermarket stores have posted record profits.",
        "Research conducted by the Australia Institute revealed excessive corporate profits \u2013 and not Australian wages \u2013 were behind the skyrocketing cost of living.\u00a0The thinktank argued big business earnings account for 69 per cent of the inflation which is above the Reserve Bank's target range of two to three per cent.Australia Institute economist Dr Jim Stanford claimed without excessive corporate price rises and profits, the RBA's consecutive interest rate rises would have been unlikely.The Australian Council of Trade Unions Secretary Sally McManus said what was occurring was a 'greed-price spiral'.\u00a0",
        "'Inflation is being fed by these companies putting up prices far more than they need to,' Ms McManus said.\u00a0'Wage growth is clearly not contributing to inflation. Any wage rises in 2022 and early 2023 have been eaten up by price rises and interest rate rises.\u00a0'Supermarkets and big business are putting prices up more than they need to, and workers are feeling the pain.'Big companies know people have no choice other than to pay the prices they set for essentials such as groceries and energy, and business is making record profits and driving up inflation.'"
