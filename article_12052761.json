        "Gary Bowyer hailed the resilience of his Dundee players after they sealed a return to the cinch Premiership with a 5-3 win over Queen\u2019s Park in Friday night\u2019s Championship title shootout.",
        "The Dens Park side edged a thrilling encounter at Ochilview to bounce back to the top flight at the first time of asking following their relegation a year ago.\u201cIt was a magnificent effort from the players tonight,\u201d Bowyer, who was appointed Dundee manager last summer, told BBC Scotland. \u201cThey deserve it, they\u2019ve been brilliant all season.\u201cWe only signed one permanent player and we\u2019ve brought lads in on loan but the way they\u2019ve stuck together and the resilience they have shown has been fantastic.\u201cEverybody said Dundee are favourites, Dundee should do this, Dundee should do that, but you\u2019ve got to go out and do it. These lads went out and did it and I\u2019m delighted for them.\u201dBowyer went through a full range of emotions in a topsy-turvy first half that ended 3-3 before second-half strikes from Lyall Cameron and Luke McCowan gave Dundee a two-goal cushion over a Queen\u2019s side who knew they needed a win to overhaul the Dark Blues at the summit.",
        "\u201cIt was a fantastic start, then it wasn\u2019t such a great start, and the goals we conceded were poor but we\u2019ll let that go now obviously,\u201d said Bowyer.\u201cIt was just absolutely amazing the resilience they had and the way they fought. They kept coming back. The spirit and character they had was just brilliant.\u201d",
        "After seeing his players lift the Championship trophy at Ochilview following a pitch invasion by jubilant supporters, Bowyer is intent on making an impact in the top flight.\u201cThe club have now got to stop being a yo-yo club and try and get established in the Premiership,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll go and attack it next season. There\u2019s a lot of work that needs to be done both on and off the pitch for that but that\u2019s not for tonight.\u201dQueen\u2019s Park slipped from second to third and must now come through six play-off matches if they are to win promotion, starting with a two-legged showdown with Partick Thistle.Manager Owen Coyle admitted his side\u2019s defending proved costly.\u201cAttacking-wise we know what we\u2019ve got in our team but I think over the course of the season our Achilles heel has been defending situations and we certainly didn\u2019t do that well tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cCongratulations to Dundee but the goals we gave away\u2026\u201cThere was so much to be pleased about but the bottom line is we\u2019ve lost a game where we could have been champions.\u201cIf we are to get to the Premiership this year we\u2019ve got to do it through the play-offs. We\u2019re hurt and disappointed but we\u2019ll get the players lifted and we\u2019ll go again.\u201d"
