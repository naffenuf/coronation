        "Lionel Messi and Julian Alvarez scored as Argentina beat the Socceroos 2-1 in the Round of 16, before Emiliano Martinez denied Garang Kuol a last-minute equaliser that would have taken the game into extra-time.Fans hoping to see the world champions in action in Australia, however, are set to be disappointed as the fixture is expected to take place in China.The proposal was first reported by the New York Times last week, which revealed an independent promoter had approached Football Australia and the AFA - Argentina's football federation.According to the report, Argentina have become the most in-demand opponent in international football after their World Cup triumph.",
        "Facing La Albiceleste, however, comes with hefty financial costs.\u00a0Along with a share of ticket sales, TV\u00a0 rights and commercial revenue from the games, AFA is also reportedly demanding a lucrative appearance fee.\u00a0The New York Times reported the starting price for the appearance fee is thought to be in the region of $5million (AUD$ 7.4million).\u00a0Argentina will play two friendlies in June in the international window between June 12 and June 20, but the identity of the teams remains unknown.\u00a0It is understood the first game will be played in Beijing, with the second in Indonesia.\u00a0A spokesperson for Football Australia confirmed the Socceroos were looking to play against a 'high-profile' opponent during the international window.",
        "'Among the various options under consideration is the prospect of facing a high-profile opponent overseas, such as in Beijing,' the spokesperson told the Sydney Morning Herald.\u00a0According to the Sydney Morning Herald, while nothing has been signed yet, an official confirmation could come as early as this week.\u00a0",
        "Ahead of a potential friendly against Argentina, Australia will focus on the draw for the Asian Cup, which takes place on Thursday in Doha.Qatar will host the tournament in January with the Socceroos hopeful of banishing the disappointment of four years ago, when they lost 1-0 to the United Arab Emirates in the quarter-finals.\u00a0The Socceroos arrived at the World Cup last year as rank outsiders, but won\u00a0two games at the World Cup for the first time in their history and reached the Round of 16 for only the second time.Despite the historic feat and the fact they came within a whisker from forcing the tie against Argentina into extra time, coach Graham Arnold revealed he felt his side had failed.",
        "'It\u2019s the way I am,' he said after Australia were knocked out.'Even though we\u2019ve succeeded and been successful, I feel like we\u2019ve failed.'I just wanted to win so badly for the nation and the fans. Making the last 16 for me wasn\u2019t enough [...]\u00a0",
        "'That\u2019s just me. I know a lot of other people might be happy with it but that\u2019s just the way I am.'\u00a0"
