        "QPR boss Gareth Ainsworth plans \u201cbig changes\u201d at the club following the end of a miserable season.",
        "Rangers\u2019 2-0 loss to Bristol City was their 12th home defeat of the campaign and highlighted their shortcomings at both ends of the pitch.\u201cIt just hits home and gives me more evidence of what I need to do in the summer,\u201d said Ainsworth, who took over in February.\u201cThere are big changes that need to happen here. We\u2019ve got to have real, big changes here in the summer. I\u2019m realising that more and more.\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be passionate. You\u2019ve got to be crawling off that pitch at the end of the game. I was really expecting a bit more today.\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to let it get to me too much. I\u2019ve got to sort my squad out and sort the changes out.",
        "\u201cI want a proper team that reflects the way I am, the way I manage, the way I want things done \u2013 and I aim to do that.\u201cI\u2019m sure there will be a lot of comings and goings throughout the summer. I want to be in here sorting it out and I\u2019ll do my best to do that.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be tough. But, given the chance and given the backing, I think I can bring the right characters in.\u201dBristol City boss Nigel Pearson believes his club can challenge for the play-offs next season if they are able to bring players in.",
        "Pearson said: \u201cI think our fan base is quite excited about how this young team can move forward.\u201cNow we\u2019ve got to get the additions right and see if we can shape the squad in a way that we can be competitive in the top half, looking to push on for the play-off places.\u201cThere\u2019s no point setting standards low or trying to be too safe with predictions. We\u2019ve got to start delivering.\u201cThe players are capable, but we need to win games like today that potentially could go either way.\u201cWe\u2019ve been involved in games this season where we really should pick points up and we\u2019ve not. So I\u2019m pleased today.\u201cI think it\u2019s important that the players and staff come back refreshed and ready to really push on. It\u2019s not about being happy with small progressions \u2013 it\u2019s about trying to be successful.\u201cThe future for the club will be bright for many years to come, which is good.\u201dGoals from Mark Sykes and Sam Bell gave the Robins victory at Loftus Road, where the home side struggled to create clear-cut chances and always looked vulnerable at the back.City, who finished 14th, were fairly comfortable against Rangers, who were top in October but finished 20th, and would have finished below relegated Reading had the Berkshire club not been given a six-point deduction.",
        "Pearson said: \u201cThat performance was just what we were trying to achieve today.\u201cThey can be quite dangerous games when people might talk about there being not a lot on them.\u201cI\u2019m sure they wanted to end on a positive note at home, and we wanted to maintain our standards in terms of our application.\u201cWe did some really good things. The performance was good, with good energy, and it\u2019s a good outcome.\u201d"
