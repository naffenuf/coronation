        "England, ranked fourth in the world, are in League A.Like in the men\u2019s competition, all matches in the league stage are played according to a league system, with each team playing one home match and one away match against each of the other teams in their group. Three points are awarded for a win, one for a draw and none for a defeat.The four League A group winners qualify for the knockout finals. There will then be one-leg semi-finals, with a draw determining which team is at home, a final and a third-fourth play-off. The two finalists will qualify for the 2024 Olympic Games alongside hosts France. If France make the final, the third place team will take the spot.The top two teams in each group remain in League A for the European Qualifiers for UEFA Women's EURO 2025.The four third-placed teams play off against the second-placed teams in each group of League B. The play-off is over two legs, home and away, with the ties determined by another draw. The winner of each match will play in League A for the European Qualifiers phase; the defeated teams will play in League B.The fourth-placed teams are relegated to League B. This then applies to the other groups \u2013 with the four group winners of League B promoted to League A and the bottom four teams relegated to League C, with the third placed teams facing a play-off.",

The eight winners of these ties will progress to round two.",
        "The second part of the play-offs will see the four winners of League B take on the two remaining runners-up and the four third-placed teams from the same group. The six winners of those ties progress to round two.In round two, 14 teams will be drawn into seven ties and the winners of each will qualify for Euro 2025 \u2013 which will be held in Switzerland.There will be no promotion or relegation matches after the second round but it will be automatically reflected in the next editions of the Nations League \u2013 which will take place across the 2025-2026 season.That competition will then decide who qualifies for the 2027 World Cup. The format will be the same but adjusted slightly to reflect the fewer number of qualifying spots."
