        "Steve Cotterill paid tribute to matchwinner Rob Street as Shrewsbury ended their home campaign with a 2-1 victory over Bristol Rovers.",
        "The Crystal Palace loanee doubled Town\u2019s advantage after captain and ex-Rovers star Luke Leahy headed the opening goal after three minutes on his 100th appearance for the club.Middlesbrough loanee Josh Coburn ended his near four-month goal drought with a 70th-minute reply for the visitors.But Rovers\u2019 hopes of avoiding a sixth game without victory ended with a miss by substitute Luca Hoole and a fine save from Marko Marosi to deny Coburn a second.\u201cIt was brilliant for Rob,\u201d said Cotterill after Shrewsbury\u2019s first win in nine and Street\u2019s fourth goal of the season after 53 minutes. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t trained this week from the game last weekend.\u201cAnd he went to his granddad\u2019s funeral this morning (Tuesday) then drove up from London.",
        "\u201cHe deserves a large amount of credit for playing. I couldn\u2019t be happier for him.\u201cHe works a lot on it (finishing) but a lot of it is confidence. It is all well and good him coming from Crystal Palace but he hadn\u2019t played at League One level.\u201dOn the three points to lift Shrewsbury into the top half of the table, Cotterill added: \u201cIt is nice to hear \u2018excellent win\u2019 because it has been a long time coming.\u201cLook at them making five substitutes. Their calibre of subs would be in our starting line-up.",
        "\u201cIt must be a delight for Joey to have a squad that size.\u201cThey have a budget that is probably twice ours. But we have taken four points out of six off Bristol Rovers and that\u2019s a good return.\u201dRovers boss Joey Barton said: \u201cWe lost the game so I don\u2019t want to be too negative towards Shrewsbury.\u201cWe have got to defend our box better. In the first five minutes we were a goal down and that gave them something to hang onto.\u201cStats are only a pointer towards a performance, the main one being we lost 2-1.\u201cBut when we got our more technical players on the pitch, we took control,\u201d added Barton who introduced five replacements in one go after Shrewsbury went 2-0 up.\u201cWe were in the ascendancy towards the back end of the game.\u201cPart of the strategy was to open up late in the game. But we didn\u2019t envisage being two goals down to a team like Shrewsbury.\u201cThere were loads of good things but it encapsulates the season in a nutshell.\u201d"
