        "Albion will play Spartans in the cinch League Two play-off final after their last place finish was confirmed despite a home victory over champions Stirling.",
        "Needing a win, Bonnyrigg Rovers to lose and an extremely unlikely-looking swing in goal difference to avoid 10th place, Albion won their match 2-0, with Joe Bevan and Charlie Reilly scoring in the second half.Bonnyrigg, meanwhile, saw off Elgin 3-0 at New Dundas Park via a Kieran McGachie brace and a late Ross Gray effort, leapfrogging their opponents into eighth place as they sealed their safety.In the pyramid play-off semi-final, Spartans beat Brechin 4-3 on penalties after a 3-2 loss at Glebe Park made it 3-3 on aggregate.Annan held on to third place, and will play Dumbarton in the promotion play-off semi-finals, despite losing 2-1 at Stenhousemuir.Matt Yates netted the winner for the hosts in stoppage time, his second goal of the game, with Tommy Goss scoring a penalty in between.",
        "East Fife end up fourth, and will play League One\u2019s ninth-placed finishers Clyde, after also being beaten, 1-0 at Forfar.Matthew Aitken scored an 89th-minute goal for Forfar, who had Roberto Nditi sent off in the first half.Dumbarton, already guaranteed to finish second, drew 1-1 at home with Stranraer, Edin Lynch equalising in the 28th minute, three minutes after Peter Grant\u2019s own goal had put the away side in front."
