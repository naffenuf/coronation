The unit will be led by Chris Ottinger, the head of distribution at MGM, who will continue to oversee distribution of MGM's new releases and film franchises, such as the James Bond and Rocky series.\"With the integration of MGM, we wanted to take advantage of the existing team to expand our business in ways that will greatly benefit our customers around the world,\" Jen Salke, who heads up Amazon and MGM Studios, said in a prepared statement.Last week, Amazon said it would add more than 100 Amazon Originals to i ts free, ad-supported streaming service Freevee."
