        "Accrington\u2019s relegation to League Two was mathematically confirmed despite a 2-1 comeback victory at Oxford.",
        "John Coleman\u2019s team needed to win and overturn an improbable 16-goal difference to have a chance of staying up but Cambridge\u2019s win over Forest Green sealed their fate in any case.Oxford went ahead in the eighth minute when Billy Bodin received Tyler Goodrham\u2019s pass, burst through the inside left channel and hammered a shot past goalkeeper Lukas Jensen.Korede Adedoyin equalised for Stanley with a brilliant individual goal in the 64th minute, ghosting past two opponents in midfield and firing home from 25 yards, moments after coming on as a sub.Aaron Pressley headed in Shaun Whalley\u2019s right-wing cross five minutes from time for Accrington\u2019s winner.The U\u2019s, who only secured their safety last week, cut through the visitors\u2019 defence several times only to be let down by poor finishing.",
        "Marcus Browne could not beat Jensen, who also turned away Kyle Joseph\u2019s drive, while Elliott Moore directed a free header over at a corner and Joseph blazed over."
