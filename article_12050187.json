        "Leeds Rhinos will pay tribute to the late Doddie Weir by wearing a limited-edition kit designed in his image when they face Castleford Tigers at next month\u2019s Magic Weekend.",
        "Former Scotland rugby union international Weir died in November after a lengthy battle with motor neurone disease (MND), but before his death had become a mentor for Rhinos great Rob Burrow, who has also been diagnosed with MND.The Rhinos have decided to honour the former British and Irish Lions ace on June 3 when they play against Castleford at St James\u2019 Park in Newcastle, the city where Weir won the Premiership title, with a shirt that will carry quotes from both Burrow and Weir in addition to a Tartan design on the side panels.\u201cI think it is a fantastic gesture by the club, especially with the link to Rob too obviously. I am really proud to have played at Leeds and I love the link with the My Name\u20195 Doddie Foundation especially as the game will be played in Newcastle where we share so many wonderful memories.\u201d",
        "Paul Thompson, director of fundraising at My Name\u20195 Doddie Foundation, added: \u201cThis is a fantastic gesture by the Rhinos. The community across both codes of rugby have come together so strongly over the past six years in support of Doddie, Rob Burrow and others.\u201d"
