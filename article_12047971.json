I like the idea of coming up with a way to dress that's more comfortable, that looks cool, that sounds good to me. But other than that, I don't care.'Tina Fey called it a 'jerk parade' in 2015 when on David Letterman: 'If you had a million arms and all the people you would punch in the whole world, they're all there. It is so unbelievable. Clearly, I'll never go again. But you go. It's this beautiful space and it's just every jerk from every walk of life is there wearing, like, some stupid thing.'"
