        "Lizzie Cundy cut a royally chic figure on Tuesday as she dressed as a Queen to film a coronation special of That Was The Woke That Was on Talk TV.",
        "The TV personality, who was also celebrating her 55th birthday, looked amazing as she slipped into an elegant white gown complete with a glittering tiara and satin white opera gloves.\u00a0Lizzie's gown perfectly hugged her curves and featured lace cap sleeves, with the back featuring a deep V design.Ensuring she looked her best for the double celebration, the beauty styled her brunette locks into glamorous waves while highlighting her features with a radiant palette of make-up.She looked in her element as posed away for the camera, getting into the spirit of things by waving Union Jack flags.",
        "Earlier in the day, the former WAG also stunned as she arrived at the Talk TV studios.Lizzie showcased her toned pins in a newspaper print mini dress teamed with knee-high black boots.Finishing off her stylish look, she added a furry pink jacket and shielded her eyes with trendy, tinted shades.\u00a0It comes after Lizzie\u00a0vowed to invite her ex-husband Jason to her next wedding.The brunette beauty was defending\u00a0Queen Consort Camilla for inviting her own former spouse, Andrew Parker Bowles to the coronation of King Charles III.And while Lizzie joked she might not ascend to the throne herself, she's vowed to put retired footballer Jason, 53, on the guestlist of her second exchange of nuptials.",
        "After tying the knot in a 1994 ceremony, Lizzie and Jason enjoyed 17 years of marriage, where they welcomed sons Josh, 28, and James, 23.But having endured a bitter divorce with the former Chelsea player in 2012, the pair are now firm friends and have worked through their differences.\u00a0",
        "Lizzie may be single at the moment, but when the time comes to make a lifelong commitment to her next love, she wants her ex to celebrate with them.\u00a0She exclusively told MailOnline: 'So many are shocked that Queen Camilla Is inviting her first husband Andrew Parker Bowles to the coronation of King Charles.'Well I salute her for it! It shows what a great and healthy relationship with her family she has and, on this huge historic day, she wants to share it with her ex.'Many might not understand this and though I\u2019m never likely to have a coronation, I would definitely invite my ex-husband to my wedding if I were to marry again.'People might think that is strange after we had such a bitter split and divorce but we have learnt it\u2019s much better to be friends than enemies, especially as we share two lovely children\u00a0together.\u00a0'For me, it was 17 years of good marriage, which is a success to me.",
        "'I think Camilla is incredible that she has kept friends with her ex-husband and they still have chats and cups of tea and great laughs together, despite what\u2019s gone on in the past.'Like myself, Camilla has two wonderful children and there is nothing better than seeing the parents get on.'So for those that are pointing the finger at her and saying it\u2019s wrong, this is what I call a healthy family.\u00a0'Well done Camilla! We could all learn a lot from her what the word family really means... Meghan take note.'"
