        "'We have experience all over the park, and big game players like Wilks (Alex Wilkinson) and Alf (Adam Le Fondre).'We believe they are vulnerable in a few areas.'Brattan, 33, who won the double with Sydney FC in 2019-20, pinpointed in form Brandon Borrello as the man his team must contain.After the winger was shifted up front by coach Marko Rudan, Borrello has been a revelation, scoring 13 goals.Borrello also recently turned out for the Socceroos against Eucador - and was again on the scoresheet.'He has had a great season, but in saying that the Wanderers have quality all over the park,' Brattan said.Many of Sydney FC's passionate supporters won't be in attendance - members of the Cove confirmed on social media earlier this week they won't be making their voices heard at Parramatta.",

Without a doubt they can give you an edge.'Being such an important game and with everything on the line, it would be fantastic if we could have both sets of (active) fans there creating that atmosphere which would just add to the occasion and make that game that little bit more special.'We've had the biggest average crowd out of any team this year and a lot of that's got to do with their (The Cove's) support and the atmosphere they create at games, so not having them there is going to make our job a little bit harder on Saturday night.'",
        "Wanderers fans from the RBB and in general admission seats have no plans to boycott the elimination final.\u00a0"
