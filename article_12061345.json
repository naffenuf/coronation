        "Charlie Teo donates $10,000 to attend charity dinner hosted by Mick Gatto - after claiming he'd been forced to drive for Uber to pay his mortgageDivisive neurosurgeon Dr Charlie Teo attended gala dinner\u00a0He earlier complained of having to drive Ubers to pay billsBy BRETT LACKEY for DAILY MAIL AUSTRALIA\u00a0Embattled neurosurgeon Dr Charlie Teo has attended a gala charity fundraising dinner organised by colourful\u00a0Melbourne identity Mick Gatto.",
        "Dr Teo, 62, whose disciplinary hearing with the Health Care Complaints Commission (HCCC) wound up last week, reportedly donated $10,000 to Gatto's Equal Access for Autism charity.Just hours before the dinner on Saturday night, in an interview published in the Daily Telegraph, Dr Teo said he was 'not crying poor' but had been forced to drive for\u00a0Uber last year to pay his mortgage and legal bills.Temporary restrictions placed on Dr Teo for the last two years while the HCCC investigated his case effectively banned him from working as a surgeon in Australia.He said he had been working outside the country but that 'the majority of work spent overseas is voluntary and often I have to absorb the travelling costs myself'.",
        "Dr Teo, who did not have a single letter of support given to the HCCC by an Australian based colleague during his hearing, was treated like a hero at the gala dinner, according to The Sydney Morning Herald.\u00a0Joining him among the eclectic cast of attendees at Melbourne's Hyatt were actor Vince Colosimo and former bikie boss Toby Mitchell chowing down on a menu designed by fallen Masterchef judge George Calombaris.\u00a0At one point singer Kate Cebrano belted out a number and, at another, host Richard Wilkins auctioned off a lunch with controversial AFL figures Ben Cousins and Sam Newman.",
        "Dr Teo and Gatto have known each other for at least a decade, with Dr Teo performing surgery and saving the life of the mother of one of Gatto's friends.Gatto once raised more than $600,000 for cancer research at a previous charity dinner with the help of Dr Teo.The neurosurgeon will have to wait for the decision of the HCCC to see whether he can operate in Australia again.\u00a0The commission is investigating whether he performed operations on two patients left with brain damage without properly informing them of the risks.But Dr Teo said the damage to his reputation had largely been done.'It is a broken system... The process absolutely needs root and branch reform and it needs it urgently,' he said.He said his colleagues didn't speak up for him because they too were worried about being 'blackballed' by the medical fraternity.\u00a0'They knew better than to speak out publicly for their own professional survival... That's why they wouldn't do it and that makes me very sad,' he told the Daily Telegraph."
